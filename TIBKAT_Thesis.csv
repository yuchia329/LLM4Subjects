Chemical programming to exploit chemical reaction systems for computation,"This thesis is on programming approaches to exploit the computational capabilities of chemical systems, consisting of two parts. In the first part, constructive design, research activities on theoretical development of chemical programming are reported. As results of the investigations, general programming principles, named organization-oriented programming, are derived. The idea is to design reaction networks such that the desired computational outputs correspond to the organizational structures within the networks. The second part, autonomous design, discusses on programming strategies without human interactions, namely evolution and exploration. Motivations for this programming approach include possibilities to discover novelty without rationalization. Regarding first the evolutionary strategies, we rather focused on how to track the evolutionary processes. Our approach is to analyze these dynamical processes on a higher level of abstraction, and usefulness of distinguishing organizational evolution in space of organizations from actual evolution in state space is emphasized.",gnd:4290091-8 gnd:4531334-9
Molecular kinetics of metabotropic glutamate receptors,"Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) belong to class C G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). They are characterized by a large extracellular domain which is composed of the ligand-binding domain (LBD), followed by a cysteine rich-domain (CRD) that ends up at the transmembrane domains (TDM). After glutamate binding, each subunit of the mGluR dimer move towards one another (intermolecular rearrangement) and then intramolecular rearrangements follow. mGluRs are organized either as homodimers or heterodimers. Eight members belonging to mGluRs are classified in three groups: group I (mGluR1 and mGluR5), group II (mGluR2 and mGluR3), and group III (mGluR4, mGluR6, mGluR7 and mGluR8). Activation kinetics of ligand-activated GPCRs has been reported to be in the range of 10-80 ms, with mGluR1 being the fastest receptor measured so far, however, it was limited by the method that was used in the respective studies. On the other hand, activation kinetics of rhodopsin, a light-activated GPCR, is in the range of 1 ms, measured with optical methods, not applicable to other GPCRs. Therefore, we used the a confocal patch-clamp fluorometry (cPCF) combined with fast concentration jumps and a high-resolution laser scanning microscope (LSM) to analyze the real activation kinetics of mGluR1 in outside-out membrane patches expressing mGluR FRET sensors. Our data show fast intermolecular activation kinetics of ∼1 ms, about ten times faster than data published previously and our value is not limited by our technique. The kinetics within a receptor subunit (A-sensor) was around 20 times slower for both activation and deactivation kinetics. The observed deactivation kinetics was determined to be in the time range of tens of ms for the E-sensor, and hundreds of ms for the A-sensor. Furthermore, we used same approach to create FRET sensors for all members of mGluRs, mGluR1 to mGluR8 and systematically analyzed dimerization and kinetics for all 36 homo- and heterodimeric forms.",gnd:4243777-5 gnd:4773018-3 gnd:4695098-9 gnd:4325632-6

Investigation of high molecular weight amine donors for the process intensification in chiral amine synthesis with transaminases,"['The synthesis of several bioactive compounds and active pharmaceutical ingredients relies on the development of general and efficient methods to prepare optically pure amines. Transaminases are industrially relevant enzymes and are useful for synthesizing a large number of compounds that contain a chiral amine functionality. Although the immense potential associated to the use of these biocatalysts, the equilibrium position is often unfavorable for amine synthesis. The use of an excess of amine donor, compared to the ketone substrate, combined with selective removal of the formed product, can help in overcoming this limitation. This work mainly focused on broadening the application of membrane-based in situ product recovery (ISPR) techniques for the transaminase-catalyzed synthesis of chiral amines. The overall work was designed around the implementation of amine donors, possessing considerably larger molecular ‘size’ compared to commonly used amine donors. To clearly distinguish these molecules from traditional donor amines, we designate them as High Molecular Weigh amine donors. With a molecular weight between 400 and 1500 g/mol, in contrast to traditional donor amines, HMW amine donors enable a size-based separation between amine donor and amine product molecules. HMW amines, provided in excess for thermodynamic equilibrium shifting can thus be simply retained by a size-exclusion mechanism by commercial membranes, while the smaller product amines are permeated.

Core element of the approach is a specially developed graphical tool, by this the actual product structuring task is performed. Therefore, the product structure and the assembly process are merged in a mutual graphical tool. In parallel, structuring measures are set up, that are formulated in the syntax of the graphical tool. By applying these measures within the tool, their impact both on the product structure and on the assembly process is directly pointed out. Thereby, an immediate evaluation of the product structuring is facilitated. For an enhancement of the evaluation a key figure system is used.

The procedures can be divided into local and global optimization techniques according to the type of the problem. If good initial values are given, the usage of local optimization techniques, (e.g., the Gauß-Newton procedure) is justified. If this is not the case, and the minimizing function has various local minimums, a global strategy must be implemented. Applying global optimization techniques one will not yield the global solution with certainty; only a probabilistic solution will be obtained. Nevertheless, combining local and global strategy and inclusion of all available a priori-information, a global optimizing system can be established that yields practical results for a wide area of problems.

The base glass is a model for sheet glasses. Arsenic was one of the classical fining agents and is still used as an oxidizing additive in heavy metal oxide glasses. During heating, the Cu2+ absorptivity slightly decreased up to a temperature of 470 ʿC. At further increasing temperatures, the absorptivity decreased more notably and after reaching a minimum at temperatures >600 ʿC strongly increased again. At smaller heating rates, the minimum was more pronounced and was shifted to lower temperatures. This was explained by the redox reaction: 2Cu2+ + As3+ ? 2Cu+ + As5+. This reaction is shifted to the left during heating. At temperatures < 470 ʿC, this reaction is kinetically frozen and at temperatures > 600 ʿC, it is in equilibrium. In-between, the kinetics play an important part. Rate constants of the redox reaction were determined from relaxation times. The rate constants showed Arrhenius behavior and were inserted into a kinetic differential equation. Numerical solutions of this differential equation were in good agreement with the results from high temperature spectroscopy. The activation energy is 210 kJ?mol-1. This value is much smaller than the activation energy of viscous flow and hence the rate determining step is assumed to be the diffusion of Cu2+.",gnd:4177303-2 gnd:4142706-3 gnd:4190891-0 gnd:4033734-0 gnd:4172682-0 gnd:4143096-7
"Interface modification by ion implantation and optical characterization of high-efficiency Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells","Three different issues are discussed in this thesis, which aim for a deeper understanding of Cu(In,Ga)Se2 material properties and solar cell functionality: (1)Near-surface ion implantation in Cu(In,Ga)Se2 absorber layers is studied as a method for the fabrication of buffer-free solar cells. Simulations show the beneficial effect of an n-type surface layer (buried junction). To obtain an inversion by means of ion implantation, an annealing procedure is developed that avoids annealing-induced degradation of the cell, minimizes the diffusion of the ions, and recovers the implantation damage. Buffer-free solar cells made from implanted absorbers show strongly improved diode characteristics comparable to the ones of cells with a CdS buffer and a maximum efficiency of 10.2% (11.2% active area). (2)A model is developed for the application of luminescence techniques on band-gap graded semiconductor thin-films. Several DA-emissions are detected in the cathodoluminescence (CL) and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of Ga-graded in Cu(In,Ga)Se2 and related to the local Ga-contents in the layer. The depth-distribution of the luminescence signal is correlated to the band-gap profile. Drift of excited charge carriers towards the band-gap minimum is caused by the grading-induced quasi-electric field, which must be considered when explaining the spectra obtained in plan-view measurements. Monochromatic CL imaging on cross-sections is capable to determine the minority carrier mobility.",gnd:4174517-6 gnd:4027606-5 gnd:4150833-6

Disorder-Free Localization,"['This thesis is a contribution at the intersection of a number of active fields in theoretical and experimental condensed matter, particularly those concerned with disordered systems, integrable models, lattice gauge theories, and non-equilibrium quantum dynamics. It contributes an important new facet to our understanding of relaxation in isolated quantum systems by conclusively demonstrating localization without disorder for the first time, answering a long-standing question in this field. This is achieved by introducing a family of models – intimately related to paradigmatic condensed matter models – and studying their non-equilibrium dynamics through a combination of exact analytical mappings and an array of numerical techniques. This thesis also makes contributions relevant to the theory of quantum chaotic behaviour by calculating novel, and often intractable, entanglement measures and out-of-time-ordered correlators.

Die Rolle des zentralen cholinergen Systems und weiterer Neurotransmitter in Nagermodellen der Temporallappenepilepsie,"['Epilepsy is one of the most common chronic neurological diseases of the central nervous system in humans and animals. Despite the development of various new antiepileptic drugs in the last few decades, obstacles to effective epilepsy treatment remain, including pharmacoresistance in more than 30 % of human patients and 50 % of dog patients as well as pronounced side effects. An antiepileptogenic therapy that suppress epilepsy development itself before the onset of spontaneous recurrent seizures would be preferable to the uncertain outcomes of symptomatic and lifelong therapy with antiepileptic drugs. Since epileptogenic processes remain barely understood, antiepileptogenic therapies are not feasible and, therefore, constitute one of the most important fields of current epilepsy research. In this context, there has so far been little research on the central cholinergic system compared to the excitatory glutamatergic and inhibitory GABAergic system. Nevertheless, recent studies have shown that an enhanced cholinergic signal is not only important for the induction and possibly maintenance of seizures, but also could bear epileptogenic properties. The goal of my work consisted of monitoring and characterizing extracellular levels of acetylcholine (ACh) in the hippocampus of rats between the initial brain insult leading to epilepsy and the chronic phase of epilepsy. Two different post-status epilepticus (SE) models of acquired temporal lobe epilepsy were used to assess model-specific differences: the chemical lithium-pilocarpine model and the prolonged electrical stimulation of the basolateral amygdala (BLA) model. The neurotransmitter ACh was sampled via microdialysis in the hippocampus of rats and analyzed via high performance liquid chromatography. We also sought to create a basic concept for strategies of antiepileptogenic therapies, e.g. by the antimuscarinic drug scopolamine. Furthermore, amino acid neurotransmitters like g-Aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate, aspartate, serine, glycine, and glutamine were analyzed to assess other neurochemical changes during epilepsy development. Extracellular levels of ACh in the dialysates rose significantly in comparison to control animals during SE in the lithium-pilocarpine model. For the first time, we were able to determine a similar (albeit lower) rise in ACh levels in the BLA model. During epileptogenesis and chronic epilepsy, no changes were observed in both models. However, ACh values in chronic epileptic animals were significantly lower than in animals in which spontaneous recurrent seizures were not detected. Though GABA and glutamate remained unchanged during SE in the chemical model, a significant rise of the concentrations of both neurotransmitters was detected in comparison to control values in the electrical model, persisting even after termination of SE. In the electrical model, glutamate levels also rose during the chronic epileptic phase. In the chemical model, there was a significant transient rise of GABA levels in nonepileptic animals in comparison to epileptic animals during the phase of epileptogenesis whereas glutamate levels of epileptic animals were significantly lower compared to control values in the chronic epileptic phase. This work allowed the first overview of extracellular ACh levels in two models of temporal lobe epilepsy in the rat hippocampus from induction of SE to the chronic epileptic phase. The extracellular rise in ACh concentrations during SE could imply its role in mechanisms of generating, maintaining, and possibly even inhibiting SE regardless of stimulus type. In contrast, GABA and glutamate seem to be more model-specific. Interestingly, values of GABA were partly increased in nonepileptic animals during the latent period. This increase could represent an attempt of the brain to prevent epileptogenic processes. Furthermore, the grade of ACh liberation seems to be positively correlated to the intensity of the SE. However, because changes of ACh levels were not seen in epileptogenesis or the chronic epileptic phase, it is questionable if ACh has epileptogenic properties. Nevertheless, hypersensitivity of the hippocampal tissue to ACh in early epileptogenesis could increase its putative epileptogenic potential. Besides, ACh release seems to be reduced in epileptic animals in the chronic epileptic phase. This reduction of ACh levels could represent a compensation mechanism. Hence, the use of cholinergic antagonists as an interesting approach for antiepileptogenic therapies could not be ruled out.', 'Epilepsien gehören zu den häufigsten chronischen neurologischen Erkrankungen des zentralen Nervensystems bei Mensch und Tier. Trotz der Entwicklung zahlreicher neuer Antiepileptika in den letzten Jahrzehnten stellen eine persistierende Pharmakoresistenz von mehr als 30 % beim Menschen und sogar mehr als 50 % beim Hund sowie Nebenwirkungen weiterhin ein großes Problem dar. Einer solchen lediglich symptomatischen und lebenslangen Behandlung mit ungewissem Erfolg wäre eine transiente antiepileptogene Therapie zur Unterdrückung der Epilepsieentstehung in der Latenzzeit zwischen Hirninsult und dem Auftreten erster spontaner Anfälle vorzuziehen. Da epileptogene Prozesse bis dato jedoch kaum verstanden sind, ist eine antiepileptogene Therapie nicht möglich und stellt einen der aktuell wichtigsten Forschungsaspekte in der Epileptologie dar. Das zentrale cholinerge System stellt in diesem Zusammenhang ein bisher wenig erforschtes neurochemisches Netzwerk dar, da es zu Gunsten vom wichtigsten erregenden Neurotransmitter Glutamat und wichtigsten hemmenden Neurotransmitter g-Aminobuttersäure (GABA) in den Hintergrund geriet. Nichtsdestotrotz zeigten diverse Studien in jüngerer Vergangenheit, dass ein verstärktes cholinerges Signal nicht nur für die Induktion und womöglich für die Aufrechterhaltung von Anfällen wichtig ist, sondern auch ein epileptogenes Potential bergen könnte. Das Ziel meiner Arbeit bestand darin, die extrazelluläre Konzentration von Acetylcholin (ACh) im Hippokampus von Ratten zwischen initialem Hirninsult und chronischer Epilepsie zu untersuchen und zu charakterisieren. Zur Überprüfung modellspezifischer Abhängigkeiten neurochemischer Veränderungen wurden zwei Post-Status epilepticus (SE)-Modelle der Temporallappenepilepsie (TLE) miteinander verglichen: Das chemische Lithium (Li)-Pilocarpin-Modell und die langanhaltende elektrische Stimulation der basolateralen Amygdala (BLA-Modell). ACh wurde über Mikrodialyse im Hippokampus gesammelt und anschließend per Hochleistungsflüssigkeitschromatographie analysiert. Das weiterführende Ziel dieser Arbeit war es, mit den gewonnenen Daten den Weg für künftige Strategien zu Studien zur Antiepileptogenese durch Einsatz anticholinerger Substanzen wie z.B. Scopolamin zu ebnen. Zusätzlich wurden Neurotransmitter aus der Klasse der Aminosäuren untersucht, um weitere neurochemische Veränderungen in der Epilepsieentwicklung festzustellen. ACh stieg in den Dialysaten während eines SE im Vergleich zu Kontrolltieren im chemischen Li-Pilocarpin-Modell signifikant an. Eine ähnliche Entwicklung konnten wir zum ersten Mal im elektrischen BLA-Modell nachweisen, die jedoch schwächer ausgeprägt war. In der Epileptogenese und Epilepsie konnten keine Veränderungen zwischen den Gruppen bei beiden Modellen festgestellt werden. Allerdings waren ACh-Werte bei chronisch epileptisch erkrankten Tieren signifikant niedriger als bei Tieren, bei denen keine spontanen Anfälle detektiert wurden. Während im chemischen Modell sowohl GABA als auch Glutamat im SE nicht erhöht waren, kam es im elektrischen Modell zu einer signifikanten Erhöhung beider Transmitter gegenüber Kontrollwerten, die z.T. noch nach SE anhielt. In letzterem Modell war Glutamat auch in der chronisch epileptischen Phase erhöht. Im chemischen Modell waren GABA-Werte in der Epileptogenese zeitweise bei Tieren ohne detektierte Anfälle signifikant höher als bei epileptischen Tieren, Glutamat-Werte hingegen in der epileptischen Phase bei epileptischen Tieren niedriger im Vergleich zu Kontrollwerten. Die Arbeit ermöglichte zum ersten Mal einen Überblick über den extrazellulären Transmitterhaushalt des ACh im Hippokampus der Ratte von der Induktion des SE bis zur chronisch epileptischen Phase in zwei Modellen der TLE. Sein extrazellulärer Konzentrationsanstieg während eines Anfalls spricht dafür, dass ACh eine Rolle in anfallsgenerierenden, -erhaltenden und womöglich sogar -hemmenden Mechanismen spielen könnte, die unabhängig von der Art des verwendeten Stimulus zu sein scheinen. Die Ausschüttung von GABA und Glutamat scheint hingegen modellspezifisch zu sein. Interessant ist hierbei, dass bei nicht-epileptischen Tieren GABA in der Latenzzeit z.T. erhöht war, was für einen Reparationsmechanismus sprechen könnte. Weiterhin ist die ausgeschüttete ACh-Menge anscheinend abhängig von der Intensität des SE. Während Epileptogenese und Epilepsie konnten jedoch keine Veränderungen in der ACh-Konzentration festgestellt werden. Ob ACh daher einen direkt proepileptogenen Faktor darstellt bleibt fragwürdig. Eine in der Epileptogenese entstehende Hypersensitivität des hippokampalen Gewebes gegenüber ACh könnte sein vermeintliches epileptogenes Potential jedoch erhöhen. Außerdem scheint die ACh-Ausschüttung bei epileptisch erkrankten Tieren reduziert zu sein, was für potentielle Kompensationsmechanismen spricht. Es ist daher nicht auszuschließen, dass cholinerge Antagonisten einen interessanten Ansatz für antiepileptogene Therapien darstellen.']",gnd:4642127-0 gnd:4140660-6 gnd:4141256-4 gnd:4015035-5 gnd:4177011-0

Spectroscopic modeling of oscillating Algol-type stars,"The aim of this thesis is to provide a computer program that is able to analyze time series of high-resolution spectra of double-lined spectroscopic eclipsing binaries to derive the stellar and system parameters of their components and to apply the program to spectra of oEA stars. We analyzed time-series of high-resolution spectra of the two brightest oEA stars (i.e., Algol-type eclipsing binaries with oscillating primary components) RZCas and TWDra using the KOREL program (orbital solutions + decomposed spectra of the binary components), the SynthV program (spectral analysis of thedecomposed spectra), and the newly developed Shellspec07_inverse program (optimized stellar parameters from composite line profiles at all orbital phases). The results show that it is possible to derive the stellar and system parameters of the two target stars spectroscopically with an accuracy that is comparable to that obtained from the light curve analysis. We assume that the secondary of RZCas shows a large dark spot on its surface pointing toward the primary, presumably originating from a cooling mechanism by the enthalpy transport via the inner Lagrangian point. Both stars have been observed during two different epochs. In 2007 and 2008, the TWDra system can be well modeled without including any Algol-typical effects like a gas stream or an accretion annulus into the calculations. We conclude that it was in a quiet state during both years. The same result was obtained for RZCas when observed in 2006.",gnd:4137481-2 gnd:4144255-6

A multiscale numerical framework for the simulation of anistropic material response of additively manufactured stainless steel 316L undergoing large plastic deformation,"Additive manufacturing (AM) offers significantly greater freedom of design compared to conventional manufacturing processes since the final parts are built layer by layer. This enables metal AM, also known as metal 3D printing, to be utilized for improving efficiency and functionality, for the production of parts with very complex geometries, and rapid prototyping. However, despite many technological advancements made in recent years, several challenges hinder the mass adoption of metal AM. One of these challenges is mechanical anisotropy which describes the dependency of material properties on the material orientation. Therefore, in this work, stainless steel 316L parts produced by laser-based powder bed fusion are used to isolate and understand the root cause of anisotropy in AM parts.

Approximation theorems for Lévy-driven Marcus (canonical) stochastic differential equations,"In this thesis, we consider the problem of the numerical approximation of the Marcus (canonical) stochastic differential equations (SDEs) driven by a Brownian motion and an independent the pure jump Lévy process. The numerical scheme used in this thesis is the non-linear discrete time approximation based on the Wong–Zakai approximation scheme. The main results of this thesis are presented in two parts. In the first part, we prove the uniform strong approximation theorem for solutions of the Marcus SDEs. This result is an extension of the approximation results known for Stratonovich SDEs driven by a Brownian motion. We also estimate the convergence rate of strong approximations. The approximation scheme requires the explicit knowledge of the increments of the pure jump Lévy process. In the second part, we apply the method suggested by Asmussen and Rosiński, and approximate the increments of the pure jump Lévy process by a sum of Gaussian and a compound Poisson random variables that can be simulated explicitly. Hence, we examine the weak and strong convergence of the modified Wong–Zakai approximations and also determine the convergence rates.

Interactions between iron oxidizing and reducing bacteria in iron-rich pelagic aggregates (iron snow),"Fe-cycling bacteria are often found coexisting in nature and a variety of interactions occur between acidophilic Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria (FeOB) and Fe(III)-reducing bacteria (FeRB). Iron‐rich pelagic aggregates (“iron snow”) are dominated by acidophilic Fe-cycling microbes, best represented by the FeOB (Acidithrix, Ferrovum) and the FeRB (Acidiphilium). This thesis aimed to elucidate the metabolic mechanisms between different FeOB and FeRB shaping iron snow formations. First, the whole genomes of representative FeOB (Acidithrix sp. C25) and FeRB (Acidiphilium sp. C61, Acidocella sp. C78) strains paired with a two-year metatranscriptome profiling monitored the activities of the iron snow microbiome, including the uncultivated Ferrovum. Both approaches revealed the presence and expression of genes involved in the synthesis of the infochemical PEA in FeOB, and the motility and polysaccharide hydrolysis enabling FeRB to join and colonize FeOB. A follow-up protein-based 13C labeling approach confirmed that chemolithoautotrophic Ferrovum fixed CO2 to produce organic carbon under both conditions and FeRB Acidiphilium and Acidocella took up the carbon under oxic conditions. Taken together, these results demonstrate the importance of chemolithoautotrophic Ferrovum (FeOB) in feeding FeRB within iron snow, implying cooperative interactions between them. Finally, the addition of PEA induced aggregation in all tested Acidiphilium spp., but not in the iron snow isolate Acidocella sp. C78. Comparative transcriptomics indicated the upregulated expression patterns of genes associated with flagellar motility in Acidphilium sp. C61. The specific aggregation and motility induction effect of PEA on FeRB promotes rapid co-colonization onto the surface of the iron snow particles. Collectively, these specific inter-species relationships between FeOB and FeRB are advantageous to fulfill their metabolic dependencies through the formation and aggregates stability of iron snow.",gnd:4004296-0 gnd:4246408-0

High temperature UV-vis-NIR spectroscopy of glasses doped with polyvalent elements,"The redox behaviour of polyvalent elements (Cu, Sn, Sb, As, Cr, Mn) in glasses with the base composition 16 Na2O - 10 CaO - 74 SiO2 in temperature range between 25 and 800 ʿC was studied by means of high temperature UV-vis-NIR spectroscopy in the spectral range from 300 to 1100 nm. Glasses simultaneously doped with CuO and SnO, Sb2O3 or As2O3, respectively, show no influence on the structure of Cu2+O6, i.e., the position and the half bandwidth (FWHM) of the Cu2+ absorption band remain constant. Increasing temperatures led to a shift of the Cu2+ absorption band towards longer wavelengths. Simultaneously, the band is becoming broader. Glasses doped with both CuO and Sb2O3 or As2O3 showed an increase in the intensity of the absorption band at temperature > 600 ʿC. This was explained by the redox reaction: 2Cu+ + Sb5+ = 2 Cu2+ + Sb3+ (similar for the As5+/3+). Thermodynamic calculations based on standard enthalpy and standard entropy values measured by square-wave voltammetry qualitatively and quantitatively explain the shift in the redox ratio observed during heating (or cooling). In glasses doped with both manganese and chromium, the redox reaction, Cr3+ + 3 Mn3+ = Cr6+ + 3 Mn2+, is frozen in below 520 ʿC, while it is in equilibrium at temperatures > 650 ʿC. Though the variation of the heating rate from 20 down to 1 K/min, it is possible to get new important knowledge about the kinetics of the reaction between chromium and manganese in glasses. The relaxation times are evaluated. Thermodynamics and kinetics of the redox reaction are illustrated by numerical calculations.

First-principles investigation of hydrogen interaction with metals,"Zusammenfassung: The presence of hydrogen (H) in metals has a deleterious effect on their mechanical properties. This phenomenon is called hydrogen embrittlement (HE). Since, the susceptibility of a metal to HE is strongly dependent on the rate and mode at which H can accumulate at a location of embrittlement, the transport of H is a critical aspect of HE. This thesis aims to advance the understanding of H trapping and diffusion in the microstructure of materials by means of first-principles methods. As first step, we considered the diffusion of H in bulk metals. The diffusion coefficients of interstitial hydrogen in bulk Fe and Ni crystals have been calculated over a wide range of temperatures. Quantum-mechanical effects have been included using the semi-classical transition state theory (SC-TST) and the small-polaron model of Flynn and Stoneham. Our results show that it is crucial to include such effects for a quantitative simulation of diffusion of H in bcc Fe even at room temperature, while in case of H in fcc Ni this is less important.Then we investigated the interaction of H interstitial with Ni grain boundaries and with TiC precipitates in Fe. In the former case two distinct types of GBs have been considered: the U+03A3 3(111)[-110] with a close-packed atomic interface structure and the U+03A3 5(210)[001] with a less dense structure consisting of open structural units of atoms. Our calculations reveal that these two GBs have markedly different interaction behaviors with interstitial hydrogen atoms",gnd:4064784-5 gnd:4064937-4 gnd:4038860-8
Light-induced release of nitric oxide and carbon monoxide from metal complexes,"The present thesis focuses on the light-responsive nitric oxide releasing molecules (NORMs) and carbon monoxide releasing molecules (CORMs) based on transition metal ruthenium (Ru) and manganese (Mn) complexes.

Modern constraint answer set solving,"Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a declarative problem solving approach, combining a rich yet simple modeling language with high-performance solving capabilities. Although this has already resulted in various applications, certain aspects of such applications are more naturally modeled using variables over finite domains, for accounting for resources, fine timings, coordinates, or functions. Our goal is thus to extend ASP with constraints over integers while preserving its declarative nature. This allows for fast prototyping and elaboration tolerant problem descriptions of resource related applications. The resulting paradigm is called Constraint Answer Set Programming (CASP). We present three different approaches for solving CASP problems. The first one, a lazy, modular approach combines an ASP solver with an external system for handling constraints. This approach has the advantage that two state of the art technologies work hand in hand to solve the problem, each concentrating on its part of the problem. The drawback is that ...",gnd:4195096-3
Retrieving spectral and biophysical parameters of land vegetation by the Earth Observation Land Data Assimilation System,"In this thesis, a new methodology for retrieval of land spectral and biophysical parameters from optical remote sensing data has been designed and used. The result of the work was a physically based methodology for Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) and Leaf Area Index (LAI) retrievals, simulation of hyper-spectral information and estimation of associated uncertainties. The presented methodology is based on the generic Earth Observation-Land Data Assimilation System (EO-LDAS). In the course of the work it was found that EO-LDAS can be used for daily estimation of FAPAR and associated uncertainties without any in-situ information and when the number of available observations is low. The results were in line with the field measurements with r2 varying from 0.84 to 0.92 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) from 0.11 to 0.16. This was the highest rate among compared products (Two Stream Inversion Package - JRC-TIP, Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer - MERIS FR and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer - MODIS MCD15). It was shown, that using MISR information, EO-LDAS temporal regularization and generic dynamic prior, it was possible to stabilize results of the retrieval and to obtain better results than MERIS FAPAR or JRC-TIP MISR. In addition, inclusion of generic static and dynamic prior information, decreases posterior uncertainties and can increase accuracies compared to in-situ data. The results showed that proper estimation of LAI and soil parameters were sufficient to simulate a hyper-spectral signal between 400 and 1000 nm with acceptable precision: best RMSE is equal to 0.03 for real data and less than 0.008 for synthetic data. This implies that in case of the given experimental set-up, LAI and soil parameters are the major mechanisms controlling spectral variations in the visible and near infrared regions.",gnd:4224344-0 gnd:4187458-4 gnd:4075677-4 gnd:4291501-6 gnd:4148259-1 gnd:4803260-8
"Numerical analysis of thermal, hydraulic and mechanical processes in the near- and farfield of underground coal gasification reactors","Underground coal gasification (UCG) has the potential to increase worldwide coal reserves by developing coal resources, currently not economically extractable by conventional mining methods. For that purpose, coal is combusted in situ to produce a high-calorific synthesis gas with different end-use options, including electricity generation as well as production of fuels and chemical feedstock. Apart from the high economic potentials, UCG may induce site‐specific environmental impacts, including ground surface subsidence and pollutant migration of UCG by-products into shallow freshwater aquifers. Sustainable and efficient UCG operation requires a thorough understanding of the coupled thermal, hydraulic and mechanical processes, occurring in the UCG reactor vicinity. The development and infrastructure costs of UCG trials are very high; therefore, numerical simulations of coupled processes in UCG are essential for the assessment of potential environmental impacts.

"Valence state, coordination and incorporation of Ti and Cr into lower mantle phases : new insight from electron energy loss spectroscopy","The knowledge of Ti4+/Ti3+ and Cr3+/Cr2+ ratios is particularly important for understanding the incorporation, element partitioning and oxidation state in the Earth's mantle and other rocky solar system bodies. In addition, both d-elements participate in a number of redox reactions taking place on the Earth's surface and in the Earth's crust. Also, the redox reactions are of great importance for the chemistry of materials, material and environmental sciences. Thus, in the presented study, calibration techniques for the determination Ti and Cr oxidation state using electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) are developed. In order to explain the signals of Ti and Cr electron energy-loss spectra, L3,2 electron energy loss near edge structures (ELNES) of a number of Ti- and Cr-bearing standard materials have been measured in a transmission electron microscope. The Ti and Cr containing standards represent a set of materials with either pure (Ti2+, Ti3+, Ti4+, Cr2+, Cr3+, Cr4+, Cr5+, Cr6+) or mixed (Ti3+:Ti4+ in various ratios) valence states, known coordination (octahedral and tetrahdedral) and site symmetry. It was found that octahedrally coordinated titanium is very sensitive to the polyhedral distortions. Effects of polyhedral distortions are particularly observed for rutile and anatase (both TiO2) and two oxides with mixed Ti3+-Ti4+ valence state, i.e. the Magnéli phases Ti4O7 and Ti5O9. The effect of valence state manifests itself in a systematic chemical shift of Ti and Cr white lines by 1.5-2.0 eV per valence state. On the basis of collected Ti L3,2 and Cr L3,2 ELNES spectra are developed two new quantification techniques for the determination of Ti4+/Ti3+ and Crn+/SCr ratios. One particular application of the EELS technique in mineralogy is the analysis of the local atomic environments in minerals. The geochemical properties of titanium and chromium in the Earth's lower mantle are still not well constrained. ...",gnd:4401792-3 gnd:4532089-5 gnd:4123130-2

Development of geophysical methods to characterize methane hydrate reservoirs on a laboratory scale,"Gas hydrates are crystalline solids composed of water and gas molecules. They are stable at elevated pressure and low temperatures. Therefore, natural gas hydrate deposits occur at continental margins, permafrost areas, deep lakes, and deep inland seas. During hydrate formation, the water molecules rearrange to form cavities which host gas molecules. Due to the high pressure during hydrate formation, significant amounts of gas can be stored in hydrate structures. The water-gas ratio hereby can reach up to 1:172 at 0°C and atmospheric pressure. Natural gas hydrates predominantly contain methane. Because methane constitutes both a fuel and a greenhouse gas, gas hydrates are a potential energy resource as well as a potential source for greenhouse gas. This study investigates the physical properties of methane hydrate bearing sediments on a laboratory scale. To do so, an electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) array was developed and mounted in a large reservoir simulator (LARS). For the first time, the ERT array was applied to hydrate saturated sediment samples under controlled temperature, pressure, and hydrate saturation conditions on a laboratory scale. Typically, the pore space of (marine) sediments is filled with electrically well conductive brine. Because hydrates constitute an electrical isolator, significant contrasts regarding the electrical properties of the pore space emerge during hydrate formation and dissociation. Frequent measurements during hydrate formation experiments permit the recordings of the spatial resistivity distribution inside LARS. Those data sets are used as input for a new data processing routine which transfers the spatial resistivity distribution into the spatial distribution of hydrate saturation. Thus, the changes of local hydrate saturation can be monitored with respect to space and time. This study shows that the developed tomography yielded good data quality and resolved even small amounts of hydrate saturation inside the sediment sample. The conversion algorithm transforming the spatial resistivity distribution into local hydrate saturation values yielded the best results using the Archie-var-phi relation. This approach considers the increasing hydrate phase as part of the sediment frame, metaphorically reducing the sample’s porosity. In addition, the tomographical measurements showed that fast lab based hydrate formation processes cause small crystallites to form which tend to recrystallize. Furthermore, hydrate dissociation experiments via depressurization were conducted in order to mimic the 2007/2008 Mallik field trial. It was observed that some patterns in gas and water flow could be reproduced, even though some setup related limitations arose. In two additional long-term experiments the feasibility and performance of CO2-CH4 hydrate exchange reactions were studied in LARS. The tomographical system was used to monitor the spatial hydrate distribution during the hydrate formation stage. During the subsequent CO2 injection, the tomographical array allowed to follow the CO2 migration front inside the sediment sample and helped to identify the CO2 breakthrough.",gnd:4282527-1 gnd:4152663-6 gnd:4169678-5
Heterogeneous catalysis for the conversion of fructose to chemicals and fuel in a continuous flow process,"The valorization of carbohydrates is one of the most promising fields in green chemistry, as it enables to produce bulk chemicals and fuels out of renewable and abundant resources, instead of further exploiting fossil feedstocks. The focus in this thesis is the conversion of fructose, using dehydration and hydrodeoxygenation reactions. The main goal is to find an easy continuous process, including the solubility of the sugar in a green solvent, the conversion over a solid acid as well as over a metal@tungsten carbide catalyst.  At the beginning of this thesis, solid acid catalysts are synthesized by using carbohydrate material like glucose and starch at high temperatures (up to 600 °C). Additionally a third carbon is synthesized, using an activation method based on Ca(OH)2. After carbonization and further sulfonation, using fuming sulfuric acid, the three resulting catalysts are characterized together with sulfonated carbon black and Amberlyst 15 as references. In order to test all solid acid catalysts in reaction, a 250 mm x 4.6 mm stainless steel column is used as a fixed-bed continuous reactor. The temperature (110 °C to 250 °C) and residence time (2 to 30 minutes) is varied, and a direct relationship between contact time and selectivity is determined. The reaction mechanism, as well as the product distribution is showing a dehydration step of fructose towards 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF).

Novel cytotoxic glycosyltransferase effectors of Legionella,"Abstract: Legionella pneumophila and Legionella longbeachae are Gram negative bacteria, which cause  Legionnaires' disease, a severe form of pneumonia. The pathogens replicate inside host cells.  Therefore, the bacteria produce a large array of effectors, which are secreted by the Dot/Icm  (Defective in organelle trafficking/Intracellular multiplication) type 4 secretion system (T4SS) into  the cytosol of the target cell. Many of the injected effectors possess enzyme activities and,  thereby, interfere with host cell functions to promote intracellular bacterial multiplication. Some  L. pneumophila effectors (e.g. Lgt1-3 and SetA) harbor glycosyltransferase (GT) activities and  share structural similarity with clostridial glucosylating toxins, which are the prototypes of  glucosylating virulence factors.  Aim of the study was the identification of novel putative Legionella glycosyltransferases by  genome sequence analysis and their characterization by biochemical, molecular- and cell  biological methods. In the first part of the thesis, the L. longbeachae protein Llo1578 was  analyzed, which shares amino acids sequence similarity with the Lgt glucosyltransferases from  L. pneumophila. Llo1578 displayed in vitro glucohydrolase and autoglucosylating activities using  UDP-glucose as a sugar donor. Expression of Llo1578 in yeast exhibited cytotoxic effects, which  were dependent on the glucosylating activity of the protein. Thus, the variants of Llo1578 with  the mutations in the identified catalytic residues W23, D126, D142, N177 and W326 did not affect  yeast growth. However, in contrast to the Lgt glucosyltransferases, Llo1578 did not affect in vitro  translation and did not modify EF1A, the substrate of the Lgt effectors. Therefore, this study  suggests that Llo1578 likely belongs to a new group of Legionella glucosyltransferases with an  unknown acceptor specificity.   The second part of the thesis was focused on the novel L. pneumophila effector LtpM (Legionella  translocating protein M). The study revealed that LtpM is a two-domain protein, which consists  of an N-terminal glycosyltransferase domain and a C-terminal phosphatidyl inositol 3-phosphate  (PI3P)-binding domain. My studies showed that the N-terminal domain of LtpM is responsible for  its glucohydrolase activity with UDP-glucose as the preferred activated sugar. The affinity of LtpM  for PI3P was determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy and revealed a Kd  value of 591 ± 117 n ...",gnd:4036659-5 gnd:4481578-5 gnd:4200230-8

Analysis of photonic structures for silicon solar cells,"Abstract: Integrating photonic structures into the surface is an established procedure to enhance the energy conversion efficiency of silicon solar cells. This is achieved by increasing the light absorption through reduced surface reflectance or longer light path lengths. The fabrication of random pyramids on monocrystalline and the isotexture on multicrystalline silicon via maskless wet chemical etching is a standard process in the photovoltaic industry. Alternative structure types aim at an absorptance enhancement compared to this state of the art, which finally increases the energy conversion efficiency of the device.<br>The analysis within this work covers (i) the development of an efficient simulation formalism for determining the optical properties of silicon solar cells with one or more structured interfaces that can operate in different optical regimes; (ii) the comparison of a large variety of photonic structures and structure combinations with regard to benefits for the solar cell optics; (iii) a further development of the structure fabrication based on nanoimprint lithography and etching focusing on the up-scaling capabilities via an increased stamp lifetime and (iv) the demonstration of an efficiency enhancement on solar cell and mini-module level via integration of exemplary photonic structures.<br>After ensuring a good agreement between the developed OPTOS simulation formalism and established modeling techniques as well as reference measurements, various photonic structures are evaluated. Diffractive rear side gratings are demonstrated to enhance the light trapping properties of 150 μm thick solar cells with planar as well as textured front side, reaching photocurrent gains of up to 3.5 mA/cm2. The experimental realization of this structure in an electrically planar but optically structured rear interface led to an absolute efficiency increase of 1.1 % and proved the potential of this concept for the first time on solar cell level. The honeycomb texture is found to be clearly superior to the isotexture on multicrystalline silicon substrates. The simulated photocurrent gains of 2.4 mA/cm2 on cell level and 1.0 mA/cm2 on module level are supported by characterization results of Al-BSF and PERC solar cells. Those were fabricated using industrial-like processes such as screen printing on the standard size of 156 × 156 mm2.

Induktion von veränderten Metabolitenprofilen in Streptomyceten durch Umweltfaktoren : Kokultivierung von Streptomyces avermitilis und Pseudomonas fluorescens und von Streptomyces coelicolor unter Schwermetallionenstress,"The cultivation with non kind microorganisms induces the production of antibacterial secondary metabolites in microbes. In S. avermitilis such reaction could be monitored by analyzing the frequently observed guttation droplets, which might serve as reservoir for secondary metabolites in streptomycetes and fungi. Analyses showed that S. avermitilis formed guttation droplets mainly contained sucrose. S. avermitilis produced the sucrose from the nutrients of the medium. As reaction coculture with P. fluorescens the reduction of available sucrose amount was detected. This suggests that the sucrose could serve as energy storage, which is mobilized under the competitive pressure in the mixed culture. As well as non kind microorganisms have certain metal ions a stimulating effect on the secondary metabolism of streptomycetes. Therefore, the effects of cobalt ion stress Streptomyces coelicolor were characterized systematically. Relatively high concentration of cobalt ion in the medium induced the differentiation of a red and a blue colored phenotype of S. coelicolor.

The H I Lyman [alpha] opacity at redshift 2.7 ≤ z ≤ 3.6,"Most of the baryonic matter in the Universe resides in a diffuse gaseous phase in-between galaxies consisting mostly of hydrogen and helium. This intergalactic medium (IGM) is distributed in large-scale filaments as part of the overall cosmic web. The luminous extragalactic objects that we can observe today, such as galaxies and quasars, are surrounded by the IGM in the most dense regions within the cosmic web. The radiation of these objects contributes to the so-called ultraviolet background (UVB) which keeps the IGM highly ionized ever since the epoch of reionization. Measuring the amount of absorption due to intergalactic neutral hydrogen (HI) against extragalactic background sources is a very useful tool to constrain the energy input of ionizing sources into the IGM. Observations suggest that the HI Lyman-alpha effective optical depth, τ_eff, decreases with decreasing redshift, which is primarily due to the expansion of the Universe.

Micro and nanostructured lithium niobate for integrated nonlinear optics,"The efficiency of nonlinear interaction processes in lithium niobate (LN) can be significantly enhanced by a confinement of the optical fields to waveguide or resonator modes. The functionalities of the optical elements strongly depend on their specific layout and can be implemented only with a sophisticated microstructure technology. This thesis, therefore, contributes to the advancement and development of existing patterning approaches and their application to the realization of microstructured waveguides and resonators. Especially the full potential of ion beam enhanced etching (IBEE) of LN is explored by the realization of advanced structures such as photonic crystals. Furthermore, a modified IBEE process which is based on KOH instead of HF is established after studying the etching behavior of ion beam irradiated LN in different hydroxide solutions for a broad range of experimental conditions. Substituting HF by KOH makes thin film LN substrates fully compatible with IBEE because KOH does not etch the intermediate silicon dioxide layer. IBEE is used in combination with electron beam lithography for large area patterning. In particular, it is used for the realization of nanoscale ridge waveguides and photonic crystal waveguides that are sufficiently long for the observation of propagation effects with a scanning near field optical microscope. In addition to IBEE, direct patterning of photonic structures by focused ion beam (FIB) is suitable for prototyping of small areas. The impact of gallium ion contaminations from the FIB milling, which remain in the substrate and impair the dimensional accuracy, is investigated. FIB patterning is eventually used to realize microdisk and photonic crystal resonators. Their linear and nonlinear optical characterization is presented, particularly the resonantly enhanced second harmonic generation from a photonic crystal resonator.",gnd:4167928-3 gnd:4065317-1 gnd:4162299-6

Trauer und Trost : verlustsensible Sozialpädagogik,"['Loss can have a tremendous impact on the course of a social work case. Social work institutions, such as welfare services for children, teenagers or homeless people, have been and are still being established as a reaction to one or more losses.

In a social context, coping with loss is a subjective task.Loss appears in a variety of dimensions and does not only occur in the aftermath of a significant person’s death. The central reaction to loss is grief, which is then responded to with comfort, which defines the educational approach in different fields.

Groundwater recharge in tropical wet regions via GIS-based methods and cosmic-ray neutron sensing,"Studies on the unsustainable use of groundwater resources are still considered incipient since it is frequently a poorly understood and managed, devalued and inadequately protected natural resource. Groundwater Recharge (GWR) is one of the most challenging elements to estimate since it can rarely be measured directly and cannot easily be derived from existing data. To overcome these limitations, many hydro(geo)logists have combined different approaches to estimate large-scale GWR, namely: remote sensing products, such as IMERG product; Water Budget Equation, also in combination with hydrological models, and; Geographic Information System (GIS), using estimation formulas. For intermediary-scale GWR estimation, there exist: Non-invasive Cosmic-Ray Neutron Sensing (CRNS); wireless networks from local soil probes; and soil hydrological models, such as HYDRUS.

Integrating satellite remote sensing and in-situ measurements to estimate the biophysical parameters of agricultural crop using multispectral and radar data,"[""A large portion of the earth's surface is covered with various vegetation classes (i.e. grassland, wetland and agricultural area, forest) of many diverse species and canopy configurations. The ability to assess and to monitor canopy parameters, such as biomass, leaf area index, and vegetation water content, is of vital importance to the study of different agronomic processes. Remote sensing techniques provide a unique capability towards probing different vegetation types and canopy by operating at different bands, observation angle etc. Over the past decades, significant progress has been made in remote sensing techniques of land processes specially vegetation characteristics through development of advanced ground-based, airborne and space-borne microwave sensors, methods and approaches such as theoretical, semi-empirical and empirical models, needed for analyzing the data.

Influence of plant water relation on ecosystem function under water stress,"In this thesis we study the interaction between biodiversity and near surface groundwater, during water stress by first characterizing the study area in terms of groundwater and soil water geochemical processes and hydrogeology in a large-scale biodiversity experiment. We also investigated the spatial and seasonal variation of groundwater chemical composition and the effect of the river Saale on the groundwater of the main experimental field before relating to diversity. Interpretation of the groundwater hydrochemical data using statistical technique showed that groundwater-geological matrix interaction, and redox- and redox-sensitive elements are the dominant factors that resulted in variation of the chemical data set. Calcite, dolomite, quartz, and siderite are found to be reactive minerals and are responsible for changes in chemical composition. Analysis of the spatial variation of the groundwater chemical composition of the experimental field showed that sampled plots BIIIA02, BIIIA13 have relatively different chemical composition from other plots. The comparison of chemical composition of the groundwater of our study area with the groundwater hosted in various hydrogeologic formation shows that, the groundwater in most of the plots of the study area have similar hydrochemical signature with the Upper Buntsandstein. Water isotope of the groundwater results also shows that most of the ground waters in wells of plots BIIIA13 and BIIIA02 are more enriched than that in other plots. PHREEQC results showed that river Saale at mean flow did not have significant effect on the groundwater chemistry. Chloride concentration measured at the inlet of the channel and in groundwater shows that the channel did not leak and therefore has no effect on the groundwater.

A bottom-up computational approach to semiconducting block copolymers: from monomer design to charge transport properties,"Conjugated polymers are very attractive materials for the scientists and industry due to low cost of the organic compounds, their lightweight, easy large-area processing from solution at low temperature and mechanical flexibility. Moreover, these materials are multifunctional and advanced technologies require both simultaneous n- and p-type conductance, i.e. ambipolarity. However, there are some hindrances which do not allow the wide spreading of this new generation of semiconductors into the market, first of all, due to their instability to ambient conditions. Moreover, determination of the tunable parameters which are responsible for high efficiency and controlled crystal packing ordering of the devices is rather complicated. A lot of efforts are done in order to improve the performance of the organic electronics as well as to shed light on the relation between the chemical structure and their intrinsic properties. Additionally, the governing factors which define the conductive properties of these materials are still under debate and this remains a great challenge for the researchers. One way to gain insight into the characteristics of polymeric materials is to begin exploring the polymers from their small constitutive units and then step-by-step to construct and characterize every compound up to macromolecular level. In this work, the semiconducting block copolymers, as promising candidates for application in organic transistors, are investigated starting from their small donor and acceptor blocks up to monomers and macromolecules, using computational methods running on different time and length scales. It is found out that the charge transport depends on the symmetry of molecules and the hopping mobilities can be predicted from isolated stacks of dimers, which are defined by minimum energy, without knowledge of the actual crystal structure.

"Two stages of skarn formation - two tin enrichments : the Hämmerlein polymetallic skarn deposit, western Erzgebirge, Germany","Skarn deposits are found on every continents and were formed at different times from Precambrian to Tertiary. Typically, the formation of a skarn is induced by a granitic intrusion in carbonates-rich sedimentary rocks. During contact metamorphism, fluids derived from the granite interact with the sedimentary host rocks, which results in the formation of calc-silicate minerals at the expense of carbonates. Those newly formed minerals generally develop in a metamorphic zoned aureole with garnet in the proximal and pyroxene in the distal zone. Ore elements contained in magmatic fluids are precipitated due to the change in fluid composition. The temperature decrease of the entire system, due to the cooling of magmatic fluids and the entering of meteoric water, allows retrogression of some prograde minerals. The Hämmerlein skarn deposit has a multi-stage history with a skarn formation during regional metamorphism and a retrogression of primary skarn minerals during the granitic intrusion.

Late glacial to Holocene climate and vegetation changes on the Tibetan Plateau inferred from fossil pollen records in lacustrine sediments,"The past climate in central Asia, and especially on the Tibetan Plateau (TP), is of great importance for an understanding of global climate processes and for predicting the future climate. As a major influence on the climate in this region, the Asian Summer Monsoon (ASM) and its evolutionary history are of vital importance for accurate predictions. However, neither the evolutionary pattern of the summer monsoon nor the driving mechanisms behind it are yet clearly understood. For this research, I first synthesized previously published Late Glacial to Holocene climatic records from monsoonal central Asia in order to extract the general climate signals and the associated summer monsoon intensities. New climate and vegetation sequences were then established using improved quantitative methods, focusing on fossil pollen records recovered from Tibetan lakes and also incorporating new modern datasets. The pollen-vegetation and vegetation-climate relationships on the TP were also evaluated in order to achieve a better understanding of fossil pollen records. The synthesis of previously published moisture-related palaeoclimate records in monsoonal central Asia revealed generally different temporal patterns for the two monsoonal subsystems, i.e. the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) and East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM). The ISM appears to have experienced maximum wet conditions during the early Holocene, while many records from the area affected by the EASM indicate relatively dry conditions at that time, particularly in north-central China where the maximum moisture levels occurred during the middle Holocene. A detailed consideration of possible driving factors affecting the summer monsoon, including summer solar insolation and sea surface temperatures, revealed that the ISM was primarily driven by variations in northern hemisphere solar insolation, and that the EASM may have been constrained by the ISM resulting in asynchronous patterns of evolution for these two subsystems. This hypothesis is further supported by modern monsoon indices estimated using the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis data from the last 50 years, which indicate a significant negative correlation between the two summer monsoon subsystems. By analogy with the early Holocene, intensification of the ISM during coming decades could lead to increased aridification elsewhere as a result of the asynchronous nature of the monsoon subsystems, as can already be observed in the meteorological data from the last 15 years. A quantitative climate reconstruction using fossil pollen records was achieved through analysis of sediment core recovered from Lake Donggi Cona (in the north-eastern part of the TP) which has been dated back to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). A new data-set of modern pollen collected from large lakes in arid to semi-arid regions of central Asia is also presented herein. The concept of ""pollen source area"" was introduced to modern climate calibration based on pollen from large lakes, and was applied to the fossil pollen sequence from Lake Donggi Cona. Extremely dry conditions were found to have dominated the LGM, and a subsequent gradually increasing trend in moisture during the Late Glacial period was terminated by an abrupt reversion to a dry phase that lasted for about 1000 years and coincided with the first Heinrich Event of the northern Atlantic region. Subsequent periods corresponding to the warm Bølling-Allerød period and the Younger Dryas cold event were followed by moist conditions during the early Holocene, with annual precipitation of up to about 400 mm. A slightly drier trend after 9 cal ka BP was then followed by a second wet phase during the middle Holocene that lasted until 4.5 cal ka BP. Relatively steady conditions with only slight fluctuations then dominated the late Holocene, resulting in the present climatic conditions. In order to investigate the relationship between vegetation and climate, temporal variations in the possible driving factors for vegetation change on the northern TP were examined using a high resolution late Holocene pollen record from Lake Kusai. Moving-window Redundancy Analyses (RDAs) were used to evaluate the correlations between pollen assemblages and individual sedimentary proxies. These analyses have revealed frequent fluctuations in the relative abundances of alpine steppe and alpine desert components, and in particular a decrease in the total vegetation cover at around 1500 cal a BP. The climate was found to have had an important influence on vegetation changes when conditions were relatively wet and stable. However, after the 1500 cal a BP threshold in vegetation cover was crossed the vegetation appears to have been affected more by extreme events such as dust storms or fluvial erosion than by the general climatic trends. In addition, pollen spectra over the last 600 years have been revealed by Procrustes analysis to be significantly different from those recovered from older samples, which is attributed to an increased human impact that resulted in unprecedented changes to the composition of the vegetation. Theoretical models that have been developed and widely applied to the European area (i.e. the Extended R-Value (ERV) model and the Regional Estimates of Vegetation Abundance from Large Sites (REVEALS) model) have been applied to the high alpine TP ecosystems in order to investigate the pollen-vegetation relationships, as well as for quantitative reconstructions of vegetation abundance. The modern pollen–vegetation relationships for four common pollen species on the TP have been investigated using Poaceae as the reference taxa. The ERV Submodel 2 yielded relatively high PPEs for the steppe and desert taxa (Artemisia Chenopodiaceae), and low PPEs for the Cyperaceae that are characteristic of the alpine Kobresia meadows. The plant abundances on the central and north-eastern TP were quantified by applying these PPEs to four post-Late Glacial fossil pollen sequences. The reconstructed vegetation assemblages for the four pollen sequences always yielded smaller compositional species turnovers than suggested by the pollen spectra, indicating that the strength of the previously-reported vegetation changes may therefore have been overestimated. In summary, the key findings of this thesis are that (a) the two ASM subsystems show asynchronous patterns during both the Holocene and modern time periods, (b) fossil pollen records from large lakes reflect regional signals for which the pollen source areas need to be taken into account, (c) climate is not always the main driver for vegetation change, and (d) previously reported vegetation changes on the TP may have been overestimated because they ignored inter-species variations in pollen productivity",gnd:4182018-6 gnd:4180674-8 gnd:4160492-1 gnd:4046629-2 gnd:4288494-9
The plant cytoskeleton as a transportation network,"The cytoskeleton is an essential component of living cells. It is composed of different types of protein filaments that form complex, dynamically rearranging, and interconnected networks. The cytoskeleton serves a multitude of cellular functions which further depend on the cell context. In animal cells, the cytoskeleton prominently shapes the cell's mechanical properties and movement. In plant cells, in contrast, the presence of a rigid cell wall as well as their larger sizes highlight the role of the cytoskeleton in long-distance intracellular transport. As it provides the basis for cell growth and biomass production, cytoskeletal transport in plant cells is of direct environmental and economical relevance. However, while knowledge about the molecular details of the cytoskeletal transport is growing rapidly, the organizational principles that shape these processes on a whole-cell level remain elusive.This thesis is devoted to the following question: How does the complex architecture of the plant cytoskeleton relate to its transport functionality? The answer requires a systems level perspective of plant cytoskeletal structure and transport. To this end, I combined state-of-the-art confocal microscopy, quantitative digital image analysis, and mathematically powerful, intuitively accessible graph-theoretical approaches. This thesis summarizes five of my publications that shed light on the plant cytoskeleton as a transportation network: (1) I developed network-based frameworks for accurate, automated quantification of cytoskeletal structures, applicable in, e.g., genetic or chemical screens; (2) I showed that the actin cytoskeleton displays properties of efficient transport networks, hinting at its biological design principles; (3) Using multi-objective optimization, I demonstrated that different plant cell types sustain cytoskeletal networks with cell-type specific and near-optimal organization; (4) By investigating actual transport of organelles through the cell, I showed that properties of the actin cytoskeleton are predictive of organelle flow and provided quantitative evidence for a coordination of transport at a cellular level; (5) I devised a robust, optimization-based method to identify individual cytoskeletal filaments from a given network representation, allowing the investigation of single filament properties in the network context. The developed methods were made publicly available as open-source software tools.Altogether, my findings and proposed frameworks provide quantitative, system-level insights into intracellular transport in living cells. Despite my focus on the plant cytoskeleton, the established combination of experimental and theoretical approaches is readily applicable to different organisms. Despite the necessity of detailed molecular studies, only a complementary, systemic perspective, as presented here, enables both understanding of cytoskeletal function in its evolutionary context as well as its future technological control and utilization.",gnd:4121944-2
Plasmon-driven photocatalytic reactions monitored by surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy,"Plasmonic metal nanostructures can be tuned to efficiently interact with light, converting the photons into energetic charge carriers and heat. Therefore, the plasmonic nanoparticles such as gold and silver nanoparticles act as nano-reactors, where the molecules attached to their surfaces benefit from the enhanced electromagnetic field along with the generated energetic charge carriers and heat for possible chemical transformations. Hence, plasmonic chemistry presents metal nanoparticles as a unique playground for chemical reactions on the nanoscale remotely controlled by light. However, defining the elementary concepts behind these reactions represents the main challenge for understanding their mechanism in the context of the plasmonically assisted chemistry. Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is a powerful technique employing the plasmon-enhanced electromagnetic field, which can be used for probing the vibrational modes of molecules adsorbed on plasmonic nanoparticles. In this cumulative dissertation, I use SERS to probe the ...",gnd:4193873-2 gnd:4333369-2 gnd:1189760266 gnd:4172264-4

Higher order mode-based beam and cavity diagnostics in 1.3 GHz superconducting cavities at FLASH,"At the Free-Electron Laser in Hamburg (FLASH) and the European X-Ray Free-Electron Laser, superconducting TeV-energy superconducting linear accelerator (TESLA)-type cavities are used for the acceleration of electron bunches, generating intense free-electron laser (FEL) beams. A long rf pulse structure allows one to accelerate long bunch trains, which considerably increases the efficiency of the machine. However, intrabunch-train variations of rf parameters and misalignments of rf structures induce significant trajectory variations that may decrease the FEL performance. The accelerating cavities are housed inside cryomodules, which restricts the ability for direct alignment measurements. In order to determine the transverse cavity position, we use a method based on beam-excited dipole modes in the cavities. We have developed an efficient measurement and signal processing routine and present its application to multiple accelerating modules at FLASH. The measured rms cavity offset agrees with the specification of the TESLA modules. For the first time, the tilt of a TESLA cavity inside a cryomodule is measured. The preliminary result agrees well with the ratio between the offset and angle dependence of the dipole mode which we calculated with eigenmode simulations.",gnd:4160446-5 gnd:4184138-4
Influence of the pore structure on the catalytic performance of Rh-supported Zr-MOFs in the hydroformylation of olefins,Zirconium-based metal-organic frameworks (Zr-MOFs) of different pore sizes  and structure were synthesized and used for the preparation of the Rh-supported catalysts. The catalytic performance was studied in the hydroformylation of olefins to the corresponding aldehydes. A series of n-alk-1-enes of different chain length and bulky olefins with different size was used to study the influence of the pore size and structure.

Rotary nonresonant energy harvesting,"Abstract: The aim of this dissertation was to develop a system for a nonresonant rotary energy harvester, which converts a fraction of rotational mechanical energy into electrical energy. With this energy, won from an extremely wide range of mechanical rotational speeds (from a few hundredths to 6000 revolutions per minute), an absolute rotary encoder is powered, which can work autarkic. In doing so, attention was also paid to build robust numerical models, which could be applied on realized prototypes. The goal was to build a simple and robust energy harvester, which can be used in the industry (for rotary encoders, door latches, etc.). There are several harvester techniques suitable for such a project, such as piezoelectrical, giant Barkhausen effect (Wiegand wires) or the electromagnetic induction principle and even a combination of several techniques can be envisaged for this purpose. These physical effects might be coupled with a mechanical nonlinear system to convert (abruptly) smallest amounts of stored mechanical energy into electrical energy. On the basis of prototypes, it was investigated which energy harvester methods are suitable.<br>Key results of this developed electromagnetic transducer system are the following ones: a rotary harvester that produces for one half-revolution an electrical peak power of 120mW when a brake torque of 70mNm is applied on the shaft. An electrical management system is conditioning the electrical power for an attached microcontroller system counting half revolutions and writing this counter-value subsequently into a non-volatile memory. In addition, a signal conditioning circuit was developed for direction detection to count reliable half revolutions in clockwise and counter clockwise direction.<br>In the course of this dissertation, investigations were not only focused on pure rotatory but also on translatory applications, which are based on very similar mathematical models. A new generation of a basepoint-excited Kinetic Energy Harvester (KEH) system has been proposed that utilizes parametric and autoparametric resonances for harvesting from environmental vibrations giving a wider frequency bandwidth than classical nonlinear systems with only one degree of freedom",gnd:7664612-9
Microbial adaptation and community dynamics in a former uranium mining and milling site,"Environmental pollution by toxic metals and radionuclides is a still growing, global problem, caused by the increasing need in industrial processes such as metallurgy, mining and fertilizer production. Furthermore, does the increasing salinity of soils by mismanagement of agriculture and industrial waste waters impose a big environmental thread. Therefore, bioremediation provides an environmentally friendly and cost-efficient way to counteract both. Bioremediation is the process by which living beings such as plants and microorganisms are used to remediate or reduce harmful contaminants from the environment. Therefore, various bioremediation methods, e.g., in situ biostimulation and bioattenuation or ex situ bioreactors have been developed. Bioremediation approaches are especially valuable for large, low contaminated areas such as former uranium mining sites. It is necessary to understand the local environmental parameters as well indigenous microbial community to increase the efficiency of in situ bioremediation approaches. Therefore, the microbial community as well as soil and water parameters of a former uranium mining and milling site in Germany were analysed in this study. Results show that the community was dominated by Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi and Proteobacteria as well as the fungal phyla Ascomycota and Mortierellomycota. Furthermore, typical soil bacteria including phyla such as Firmicutes and Verrucomicrobia were found. Additionally, various classes typically found in saline environments were shown. Thus, it can be concluded that the co-stress by high salt and metal concentrations led to an adapted microbial community including typical members from both environments. The investigation revealed, in combination with soil and water analysis, showing high salt, especially sulphate and metal concentrations, an influence of the community structure by remediation processes.",gnd:4232790-8 gnd:4143852-8 gnd:4178992-1 gnd:4158586-0 gnd:4611954-1 gnd:4145644-0 gnd:4039226-0 gnd:4157339-0 gnd:4169808-3

Topological phase transitions in Calabi-Yau compactifications of M-theory,"We construct five-dimensional gauged supergravity actions which describe flop and conifold transitions in M-theory compactified on Calabi-Yau threefolds. While the vector multiplet sector is determined exactly, we use the unitary Wolf spaces to model the universal hypermultiplet together with N charged hypermultiplets corresponding to winding states of M2-branes. After specifying the hypermultiplet sector the actions are uniquely determined by M-theory. As an application we consider five-dimensional Kasner cosmologies. Including the dynamics of the winding modes, we find smooth cosmological solutions which undergo flop and conifold transitions. Instead of the usual runaway behavior the scalar fields of these solutions generically stabilize in the transition region where they oscillate around the transition locus.

Exploring potential energy surfaces in ground- and excited states,"Chemical reactivity of atoms, molecules and ions is governed by their underlying potential energy surface. Calculating the whole potential energy surface within reasonable bounds, is impossible for all but the smallest molecules. Usually, only parts of the full potential energy surface can be studied, namely stationary points and the minimum energy paths connecting them. By comparing energies of stationary points and their separating barriers, conclusions regarding possible reactions mechanism, or their infeasibility, can be drawn. Taking excited states into account leads to further complications, as now multiple potential energy surfaces have to be considered and root flips between different excited states may occur, requiring effective state-tracking. Part II of this thesis describes the required methods to locate stationary points and minimum energy paths on potential energy surfaces, by using surface-walking, chain-of-states optimization and intrinsic reaction coordinate integration. Several approaches to state-tracking are presented in chapter 4. Results of this thesis are presented in Part III, containing two contributions to the field of photochemistry: chapter 12 provides a possible excited-state reaction mechanism for a biaryl cross-coupling reaction and offers a plausible explanation for its high regioselectivity. The second contribution is the development pysisyphus (chapter 13), an external optimizer implemented in python, aware of excited states and thus the core of this thesis. By implementing the state-tracking algorithms outlined in chapter 4 it allows effective and efficient optimizations of stationary points in ground- and excited-states.

Multi-spectrum retrieval of maps of Venus´ surface emissivity in the infrared,"The main goal of this cumulative thesis is the derivation of surface emissivity data in the infrared from radiance measurements of Venus. Since these data are diagnostic of the chemical composition and grain size of the surface material, they can help to improve knowledge of the planet’s geology. Spectrally resolved images of nightside emissions in the range 1.0-5.1 μm were recently acquired by the InfraRed Mapping channel of the Visible and InfraRed Thermal Imaging Spectrometer (VIRTIS-M-IR) aboard ESA’s Venus EXpress (VEX). Surface and deep atmospheric thermal emissions in this spectral range are strongly obscured by the extremely opaque atmosphere, but three narrow spectral windows at 1.02, 1.10, and 1.18 μm allow the sounding of the surface. Additional windows between 1.3 and 2.6 μm provide information on atmospheric parameters that is required to interpret the surface signals. Quantitative data on surface and atmosphere can be retrieved from the measured spectra by comparing them to simulated spectra. A numerical radiative transfer model is used in this work to simulate the observable radiation as a function of atmospheric, surface, and instrumental parameters. It is a line-by-line model taking into account thermal emissions by surface and atmosphere as well as absorption and multiple scattering by gases and clouds. The VIRTIS-M-IR measurements are first preprocessed to obtain an optimal data basis for the subsequent steps. In this process, a detailed detector responsivity analysis enables the optimization of the data consistency. The measurement data have a relatively low spectral information content, and different parameter vectors can describe the same measured spectrum equally well. A usual method to regularize the retrieval of the wanted parameters from a measured spectrum is to take into account a priori mean values and standard deviations of the parameters to be retrieved. This decreases the probability to obtain unreasonable parameter values. The multi-spectrum retrieval algorithm MSR is developed to additionally consider physically realistic spatial and temporal a priori correlations between retrieval parameters describing different measurements. Neglecting geologic activity, MSR also allows the retrieval of an emissivity map as a parameter vector that is common to several spectrally resolved images that cover the same surface target. Even applying MSR, it is difficult to obtain reliable emissivity maps in absolute values. A detailed retrieval error analysis based on synthetic spectra reveals that this is mainly due to interferences from parameters that cannot be derived from the spectra themselves, but that have to be set to assumed values to enable the radiative transfer simulations. The MSR retrieval of emissivity maps relative to a fixed emissivity is shown to effectively avoid most emissivity retrieval errors. Relative emissivity maps at 1.02, 1.10, and 1.18 μm are finally derived from many VIRTIS-M-IR measurements that cover a surface target at Themis Regio. They are interpreted as spatial variations relative to an assumed emissivity mean of the target. It is verified that the maps are largely independent of the choice of many interfering parameters as well as the utilized measurement data set. These are the first Venus IR emissivity data maps based on a consistent application of a full radiative transfer simulation and a retrieval algorithm that respects a priori information. The maps are sufficiently reliable for future geologic interpretations.",gnd:4497183-7
Development of a new microscopy method : optical photon reassignment microscopy,"In this thesis a promising new superresolution technique called Optical Photon Reassignment (OPRA) microscopy is introduced and applied to the field of fluorescence microscopy. The method is a optical realization of the computer-based reassignment principle in confocal microscopy introduced by Sheppard in 1988 [17]. There, the spatial information in the pinhole plane is used to increase the resolution. In the year 2010 this method received a lot attention as Müller and Enderlein published the same principle including experimental data from fluorescent samples [23]. As in OPRA the computational reassignment process is done optically, any necessary processing is avoided and only one camera readout is required. The microscopy concept, together with proof-of-principle experiments and a mathematical framework, was published and patented in 2013 [24, SR1]. The method combines several important properties of fluorescent imaging towards non invasive live-cell imaging in a unique way. OPRA achieves two-fold resolution enhancement in the focal plane if compared with the cut-off frequency of standard widefield microscopy. As OPRA does not require any processing, it is suitable for extremely fast imaging, especially if the method is parallelized. ...",gnd:4290958-2

Functionalization of nanoporous carbon materials for chiral separation and heterogeneous oxidation catalysis,"The impact that catalysis has on global economy and environment is substantial, since 85% of all chemical industrial processes are catalytic. Among those, 80% of the processes are heterogeneously catalyzed, 17% make use of homogeneous catalysts, and 3% are biocatalytic processes. Especially in the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industry, a significant part of these processes involves chiral compounds. Obtaining enantiomerically pure compounds is necessary and it is usually accomplished by asymmetric synthesis and catalysis, as well as chiral separation. The efficiency of these processes may be vastly improved if the chiral selectors are positioned on a porous solid support, thereby increasing the available surface area for chiral recognition. Similarly, the majority of commercial catalysts are also supported, usually comprising of metal nanoparticles (NPs) dispersed on highly porous oxide or nanoporous carbon material.

Upper Jurassic geothermal reservoirs of South Germany : characterization and novel exploration strategy using an integrated sequence stratigraphic approach,"This study systematically investigates the geothermal reservoir properties of the approximately 500-600 m thick Upper Jurassic carbonates in the subsurface of the Molasse basin, where only specific intervals contribute to the geothermal aquifer. Therefore, this study integrates all relevant aspects of geothermal reservoir characterization in carbonates following an 1-D (core and well data) to 2-D (correlations) to 3-D (seismic interpretation and integration) approach. This hierarchical workflow, which is based on reservoir characterization workflows established by the hydrocarbon industry is then modified to understand the characteristics and distribution of geothermal reservoir types involving the following steps: (1) core-based facies analysis, (2) borehole image and well log analysis, (3) sequence-stratigraphic framework, (4) interpretation of depositional environments, (5) identification of potential reservoir types and (6) integration of dynamic data. The core-based facies analysis reveals twentytwo lithofacies types, three depositional sequences for the Upper Jurassic and one for the Upper Jurassic/Lower Cretaceous Purbeck Formation. Large parts of the interpreted depositional environment correspond to a relatively deep (below storm-wave base) deposetting. Towards the top of the succession, a change to a shallower, higher water energy environment is observed, with clear indications of exposure. A newly established multi-proxy workflow for borehole image interpretation in carbonates reveals novel opportunities to link the core-based observations with the borehole images and shows how to maximize the value of information of such logs. The vertical stacking of nine distinct borehole image facies types, as well as a semi-quantitative charting of stratal surfaces, provided new insights into the sequence-stratigraphic development and the characterization of geothermal reservoir types. The evaluation of the 3D seismic survey yielded a best practice approach to differentiate three dominating seismic facies types based on their reflectivity and to differentiate between potential reservoir facies and non-reservoir facies. The results of the 1-D and 2- D analysis were used to validate the interpretation on various scales and draw 4 conclusions, that can be applied directly to the early exploration stage of emerging geothermal projects in the Molasse basin. The local, regional and basin-wide sequence-stratigraphic correlation show thickness variations of the Upper Jurassic carbonates. The integration of paleotectonic aspects into the sequence-stratigraphic interpretation adds to the understanding of these thickness variations. Along with the thickness variations, a change of depositional environment and facies types were documented. All these factors affect the characteristics and the distribution of potential geothermal reservoir types. Ultimately, the integration of dynamic data allows a ranking of the geothermal reservoir types and a subdivision into “high-k dominated” and “matrix-dominated” geothermal reservoir types. It shows that the investigated Upper Jurassic geothermal field of the study area is a combination of structural and stratigraphic traps. The sequence stratigraphic context explains the distribution of the preferential fluid pathways and is a crucial element for a successful and sustainable geothermal development strategy in Upper Jurassic carbonates.",gnd:4020285-9 gnd:4168718-8 gnd:4147301-2 gnd:4206678-5
Integrated structural analysis using isogeometric finite element methods,"The gradual digitization in the architecture, engineering, and construction industry over the past fifty years led to an extremely heterogeneous software environment, which today is embodied by the multitude of different digital tools and proprietary data formats used by the many specialists contributing to the design process in a construction project. Though these projects become increasingly complex, the demands on financial efficiency and the completion within a tight schedule grow at the same time. The digital collaboration of project partners has been identified as one key issue in successfully dealing with these challenges. Yet currently, the numerous software applications and their respective individual views on the design process severely impede that collaboration. An approach to establish a unified basis for the digital collaboration, regardless of the existing software heterogeneity, is a comprehensive digital building model contributed to by all projects partners. This type of data management known as building information modeling (BIM) has many benefits, yet its adoption is associated with many difficulties and thus, proceeds only slowly. One aspect in the field of conflicting requirements on such a digital model is the cooperation of architects and structural engineers. Traditionally, these two disciplines use different abstractions of reality for their models that in consequence lead to incompatible digital representations thereof. The onset of isogeometric analysis (IGA) promised to ease the discrepancy in design and analysis model representations. Yet, that initial focus quickly shifted towards using these methods as a more powerful basis for numerical simulations. Furthermore, the isogeometric representation alone is not capable of solving the model abstraction problem. It is thus the intention of this work to contribute to an improved digital collaboration of architects and engineers by exploring an integrated analysis approach on the basis of an unified digital model and solid geometry expressed by splines. In the course of this work, an analysis framework is developed that utilizes such models to automatically conduct numerical simulations commonly required in construction projects. In essence, this allows to retrieve structural analysis results from BIM models in a fast and simple manner, thereby facilitating rapid design iterations and profound design feedback. The BIM implementation Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) is reviewed with regard to its capabilities of representing the unified model. The current IFC schema strongly supports the use of redundant model data, a major pitfall in digital collaboration. Additionally, it does not allow to describe the geometry by volumetric splines. As the pursued approach builds upon a unique model for both, architectural and structural design, and furthermore requires solid geometry, necessary schema modifications are suggested. Structural entities are modeled by volumetric NURBS patches, each of which constitutes an individual subdomain that, with regard to the analysis, is incompatible with the remaining full model. The resulting consequences for numerical simulation are elaborated in this work. The individual subdomains have to be weakly coupled, for which the mortar method is used. Different approaches to discretize the interface traction fields are implemented and their respective impact on the analysis results is evaluated. All necessary coupling conditions are automatically derived from the related geometry model. The weak coupling procedure leads to a linear system of equations in saddle point form, which, owed to the volumetric modeling, is large in size and, the associated coefficient matrix has, due to the use of higher degree basis functions, a high bandwidth. The peculiarities of the system require adapted solution methods that generally cause higher numerical costs than the standard procedures for symmetric, positive-definite systems do. Different methods to solve the specific system are investigated and an efficient parallel algorithm is finally proposed. When the structural analysis model is derived from the unified model in the BIM data, it does in general initially not meet the requirements on the discretization that are necessary to obtain sufficiently accurate analysis results. The consequently necessary patch refinements must be controlled automatically to allowfor an entirely automatic analysis procedure. For that purpose, an empirical refinement scheme based on the geometrical and possibly mechanical properties of the specific entities is proposed. The level of refinement may be selectively manipulated by the structural engineer in charge. Furthermore, a Zienkiewicz-Zhu type error estimator is adapted for the use with isogeometric analysis results. It is shown that also this estimator can be used to steer an adaptive refinement procedure.",gnd:7861550-1 gnd:4060592-9 gnd:4376916-0 gnd:7718401-4
Berechnung der Stator-Rotor-Wechselwirkung in Turbomaschinen,"Fluid flow through thermal turbomachines is inherently unsteady due to the succession of stationary and rotating blade rows. Together with the influences of solid walls and rising physical equalization processes, extremely complex, threedimensional flow fields are formed. Modern numerical methods allow a time-accurate simulation of those flow effects. In this way, unsteady flow phenomena can be taken into account in the aerodynamic design process in order to further increase the efficiency of energy conversion in turbomachines. This report describes the modifications to a threedimensional Navier-Stokes solver to enable the simulation of unsteady stator/rotor interaction in turbomachines. A method for the time-accurate coupling of the flow fields in relative moving blade rows is developped. A time transformation allows the use of periodic boundary conditions. In this way, the real blade count ratio of a turbomachine stage is modelled without a periodic extension of the computational domain. In order to enable efficient unsteady simulations, several acceleration techniques which lead to a drastic reduction of the long computation times of explicit, time-accurate integration methods are investigated. The numerical method is used to simulate the flow through a 1.5-stage axial flow turbine. The calculated flow field solution is analysed. Identified flow phenomena are visualized and described. A comparison of the numerical results with experimental data shows the qualification of the method to predict unsteady stator/rotor interaction effects in turbomachines.",gnd:4041456-5 gnd:4000589-6 gnd:4058076-3
Multi-Scale Modeling of Lithium ion Batteries : a thermal management approach and molecular dynamic studies,"Rechargeable lithium ion batteries (LIBs) play a very significant role in power supply and storage. In recent decades, LIBs have caught tremendous attention in mobile communication, portable electronics, and electric vehicles. Furthermore, global warming has become a worldwide issue due to the ongoing production of greenhouse gases. It motivates solutions such as renewable sources of energy. Solar and wind energies are the most important ones in renewable energy sources. By technology progress, they will definitely require batteries to store the produced power to make a balance between power generation and consumption. Nowadays,rechargeable batteries such as LIBs are considered as one of the best solutions. They provide high specific energy and high rate performance while their rate of self-discharge is low. Performance of LIBs can be improved through the modification of battery characteristics. The size of solid particles in electrodes can impact the specific energy and the cyclability of batteries. It can improve the amount of lithium content in the electrode which is a vital parameter in capacity and capability of a battery. There exist diferent sources of heat generation in LIBs such as heat produced during electrochemical reactions, internal resistance in battery. The size of electrode's electroactive particles can directly affect the produced heat in battery. It will be shown that the smaller size of solid particle enhance the thermal characteristics of LIBs. Thermal issues such as overheating, temperature maldistribution in the battery, and thermal runaway have confined applications of LIBs. Such thermal challenges reduce the Life cycle of LIBs. As well, they may lead to dangerous conditions such as fire or even explosion in batteries. However, recent advances in fabrication of advanced materials such as graphene and carbon nanotubes with extraordinary thermal conductivity and electrical properties propose new opportunities to enhance their performance. Since experimental works are expensive, our objective is to use computational methods to investigate the thermal issues in LIBS. Dissipation of the heat produced in the battery can improve the cyclability and specific capacity of LIBs. In real applications, packs of LIB consist several battery cells that are used as the power source. Therefore, it is worth to investigate thermal characteristic of battery packs under their cycles of charging/discharging operations at different applied current rates. To remove the produced heat in batteries, they can be surrounded by materials with high thermal conductivity. Parafin wax absorbs high energy since it has a high latent heat. Absorption high amounts of energy occurs at constant temperature without phase change. As well, thermal conductivity of parafin can be magnified with nano-materials such as graphene, CNT, and fullerene to form a nano-composite medium. Improving the thermal conductivity of LIBs increase the heat dissipation from batteries which is a vital issue in systems of battery thermal management. The application of two-dimensional (2D) materials has been on the rise  since exfoliation the graphene from bulk graphite. 2D materials are single-layered in an order of nanosizes which show superior thermal, mechanical, and optoelectronic properties. They are potential candidates for energy storage and supply, particularly in lithium ion batteries as electrode material. The high thermal conductivity of graphene and graphene-like materials can play a significant role in thermal management of batteries. However, defects always exist in nano-materials since there is no ideal fabrication process. One of the most important defects in materials are nano-crack which can dramatically weaken the mechanical properties of the materials. Newly synthesized crystalline carbon nitride with the stoichiometry of C3N have attracted many attentions due to its extraordinary mechanical and thermal properties. The other nano-material is phagraphene which shows anisotropic mechanical characteristics which is ideal in production of nanocomposite. It shows ductile fracture behavior when subjected under uniaxial loadings. It is worth to investigate their thermo-mechanical properties in its pristine and defective states. We hope that the findings of our work not only be useful for both experimental and theoretical researches but also help to design advanced electrodes for LIBs.",gnd:4004687-4
"Archaeological, proteomic and isotopic approaches to investigating dietary change in Holocene Africa","Africa is one of the most climatically and ecologically diverse continents on the planet and provides important case studies for considering the context in which pastoralism and agriculture first emerged. Despite the importance of Africa in our global understanding of food production, for many regions, the paucity of large-scale, dated zooarchaeological and archaeobotanical evidence from the Holocene means we still have a limited understanding of how herding and farming developed. This thesis provides new dietary insights into past communities living in eastern and Central Africa: two key regions where it has been argued that changing environments played a major role in shaping agricultural and pastoral expansions. It is hypothesized that in arid northern and eastern Africa the development of pastoral lifeways, including dairying, were influenced by water availability with the desiccation of the Sahara and shifting monsoons pushing communities southwards. In contrast, the closed, humid and wet conditions of the equatorial rainforest are thought to have presented barriers for the expansion of agriculture. The three papers presented here provide new multidisciplinary evidence for milk and domesticated plant consumption in Holocene Africa and emphasise the need for a more nuanced, context-specific approach to understanding past subsistence in eastern and Central Africa rather than sweeping models based on genetics, linguistics, or environmentally determinist assumptions.",gnd:4135837-5 gnd:4160492-1 gnd:4043216-6 gnd:4002827-6

Towards self-assembled metamaterials,"How far can we push chemical self-assembly? This is one of the 25 biggest questions science is facing over the next quarter century, as reported by the Science journal in 2005. The idea of self-assembly is to fabricate synthetic structures or materials from the bottom-up. Up to date a huge class of distinct structures was successfully demonstrated to be fabricated by self-assembly. One important scientific area that exerts the ideas of self-assembly arose from the fusion of the fields of colloidal nanochemistry and nanooptics. There, the focus is on the fabrication of bottom-up nanophotonic structures with a tailored optical response. Very interesting are self-assembled metamaterials (MMs). They promise to widen the possibilities on how to control the propagation of light to an extraordinary degree. Concerning self-assembled MMs the precise spatial arrangement of its unit cells across larger dimensions is not possible in most cases; leading essentially to amorphous structures. Such self-assembled MMs require novel analytical means to describe their optical properties and innovative designs of functional elements that possess a desired near- and far-field response. The first goal of this thesis is the introduction and development of a feasible theoretical description of amorphous MMs. Once the theory is established the second goal is on experimental realizations of self-assembled MMs. Therefore, the focus of this thesis is on self-assembled MMs and the question on how far they can be pushed to obtain artificial materials with an extraordinary optical response.",gnd:4570699-2 gnd:4126830-1 gnd:7547278-8
The influence of the electrolyte on the electrochemical behavior of PTMA as cathodic electrode material,"The TEMPO-based polymer PTMA is a standard material for the research of organic radical batteries and displays a high capacity and a high rate stability at elevated currents when used with lithium-ion battery electrolytes. However, these electrolytes are the source of safety concerns and cause the dissolution of the organic electrode active material in the electrolyte, which limits the cycle life and leads to increased self-discharge. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the complex interactions and the resulting electrochemical behavior of PTMA-based electrodes in combination with different alternative electrolytes. The integrated publications establish the important role of the electrolyte for organic active materials and the lack of studies on this topic. Subsequently, the great influence of the electrolyte composition and concentration on the performance of PTMA-based electrodes is highlighted. In particular, a positive effect of highly concentrated electrolytes on the stability and self-discharge of PTMA-based electrodes is revealed. Based on this, the use of aprotic and protic ionic liquids as electrolytes for PTMA is investigated. There, a superior performance for PTMA in FSI--based aprotic ionic liquids is obtained. Lastly, the important aspect of self-discharge of PTMA with respect to current, rest time and electrolyte is studied. It is shown that the self-discharge mechanism strongly depends on the applied charging current, which is affected by the transport properties of the used electrolyte. The results of this dissertation show that the electrochemical behavior of PTMA is significantly affected by the alternative electrolytes. It is evident that with the use of different electrolyte concepts, the performance of PTMA can be optimized in a task-specific manner. In addition, the studies show that the electrolyte of an electrochemical investigation setup can be understood as a tool that can influence and elucidate the processes within the cells.",gnd:4004687-4 gnd:4151826-3

Wärmeübertrag in der Ultra-Hochvakuum-Rasterwärmemikroskopie,"['The scanning thermal microscope (SThM) is an instrument to simultaneously probe the sample surface and its related temperature distribution. By scanning a needle-like temperature sensor in close proximity to the sample an nm-resolution is achieved. In this work I built a SThM on basis of an ultrahigh vacuum scanning tunneling microscope (UHV-SThM) and designed an appropriate temperature sensor which is also easy to manufacture. The objective of my work was to investigate the thermal heat transfer between a sensor tip and a sample at very close proximity. The dominant mechanism of heat transfer under UHV-conditions is shown to be the evanescent modes of the thermal radiation field. The heat transfer decreases exponentially with tip-sample distance on a typical length scale of 10 nm. Due to this proximity effect of heat transfer the lateral resolution of the UHV-SThM is in the order of 10 nm. The thermal resolution is about 40 mK.

Genotypic and phenotypic analysis of the spike row-type in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) : kumulative Dissertation,"['Labile; Intermedium barley; lab locus; whole genome mapping; genetic mapping; Vrs1; Int-c; veracode analysis; barley domestications; barley evolution', 'Analyzing the genotypic status of the known row-type loci in different barley collections and combining this data with the phenotypic status allowed us to efficiently explore its genetic diversity of spikelet fertility. The approach applied in this thesis involved an extensive study of the haplotype/phenotype relations in a large number of wild, labile and Intermedium barleys. The overall picture that emerged suggested that besides the known row-type genes, there must be additional genes involved in the control of spikelet fertility. From the results a clear idea arose about the genotypic status of the Vrs1 and Int-c in labile, Intermedium and wild barley collections and the role of these loci in spikelet fertility. Special attention was paid to labile barley, which is considered an intermediate form between two- and six-rowed barley. Investigating labile accessions we managed to map the lab locus on barley chromosome 5HL. Subsequent studies confirmed that lab is controlling floret development and fertility during spike developmental stages. Another remarkable observation was that a group of wild barley ssp. spontaneum genotypically carried the Intermedium haplotype at vrs1 and Int-c loci, yet displayed an Intermedium phenotype with enlarged lateral spikelets but not setting any seeds. These latter plants were named ssp. spontaneum (Intermedium). It was subsequently discovered that the Intermedium barley collection carried the same genotype/haplotype as the ssp. spontaneum “Intermedium” group yet in contrast to the latter showed lateral spikelet fertility, including setting of (small) seeds. This suggests that other additional genes are involved in spikelet fertility in this collection. In conclusion, a new model is introduced on the relation between wild and cultivated barley during domestication based on the re-sequencing of the Vrs1, Vrs4 and Int-c genes. I believe that whole genome studies in such different barley collections will confirm the proposed domestication model presented in this study and that we will thus be able to better understand barley domestication and evolution process.', 'Durch genotypische Untersuchungen mithilfe von bekannten Ährenarchitekturgenen (‘row-type genes‘) in Kombination mit phänotypischen Untersuchungen in verschiedenen Gerstenkollektionen wurden neue Erkenntnisse über die genetische Diversität der Ährchenfertilität gewonnen. Daneben konnten durch das in dieser Studie gezeigte Haplo-/Phänotyp-Verhältnis in den getesteten Wild-, labile- und Intermedium-Kollektionen Hinweise erhalten werden, dass neben den bekannten Ährenarchitekturgenen auch andere Gene eine wesentliche Rolle bei der Ausprägung der Ärchenfertilität spielen. Die Ergebnisse zeigen Korrelationen zwischen dem genotypischen Status der vrs1 und int-c Loci und den phänotypischen Ausprägungen in den verschiedenen Gerstenkollektionen, was neue Erkenntnisse über deren Rolle in der Fertilitätsausprägung lieferte.

Des Weiteren konnte gezeigt werden, dass das lab-Gen die Blütchenbildung und -fertilität während der Ährenentwicklung kontrolliert. Ein neues Resultat dieser Studie zeigt, dass eine Gruppe von Wild-Akzessionen (ssp.

Assembly of photosystem I in thylakoid membranes,"The light reactions of photosynthesis are carried out by a series of multiprotein complexes embedded in thylakoid membranes. Among them, photosystem I (PSI), acting as plastocyanin-ferderoxin oxidoreductase, catalyzes the final reaction. Together with light-harvesting antenna I, PSI forms a high-molecular-weight supercomplex of ~600 kDa, consisting of eighteen subunits and nearly two hundred co-factors. Assembly of the various components into a functional thylakoid membrane complex requires precise coordination, which is provided by the assembly machinery. Although this includes a small number of proteins (PSI assembly factors) that have been shown to play a role in the formation of PSI, the process as a whole, as well as the intricacy of its members, remains largely unexplored. In the present work, two approaches were used to find candidate PSI assembly factors.

Cross-formalism resource discovery in smart environments,"Nowadays, the Internet of Things (IoT) is becoming progressively colloquial to media. However, when there are trillions of resources out there, how can we spontaneously specify the resource we need? Therefore, one of the main research questions is the device and service discovery. Many standard web services descriptions are used to describe not only web services but also physical devices. These devices are encapsulated under the web service communication layer to make them available on the Internet. This technique enables automatic discovery, configuration, and execution of resources in dynamic environments. Thus, we focus on the resource description language that allows semantic annotation. Nevertheless, there is no single standard formalism to describe resources. It is more tactful to handle multiple description formalisms simultaneously. This thesis presents a cross-formalism resource discovery technique which utilizes the user context and resource’s context to improve the recommendation of resources. The discovery process should not be restricted to single resource description formalism. Moreover, the matching algorithm should be user-aware and environmentally adaptive, i.e. depending on the user’s current situation, rather than limit to keyword-based search. This thesis explains the implementation detail and shows the evaluation of each implemented module. We aimed to prove that the quality of the result is improved significantly compared to conventional discovery techniques. To demonstrate the usability of the proposed method, we deploy it in MERCURY. MERCURY is a platform that allows both businesses to engage with their customers and end users to create custom-made applications. Within the context of MERCURY, registration, assembling, and execution of resources need the automatic resource discovery. Since the implementation of this work is designed to be a standalone service, there is no restriction to use it under the domain of MERCURY.",gnd:4154995-8 gnd:7713781-4 gnd:1027189210
Near-infrared laser surface treatment of milled CFRP aircraft structures for bonded repair applications,"['Carbon fibre reinforced polymers (CFRP) are widely used as a material for aircraft structures. During their lifetime, aircraft structures can be subject to damages that have to be repaired to maintain aircraft safety. For a lightweight and material-efficient repair, the scarf bonded joint is the preferred solution. The scarf bonded joint is produced by removing the damaged material by milling and the application of a repair patch through adhesive bonding. A critical step during the adhesive bonding process is surface treatment since it significantly influences the bond strength. This work investigates the effects of near-infrared (N-IR) surface treatment on the adhesive properties of milled CFRP. The laser treatment is able to remove disruptive milling debris from the surface. As a result, a significant increase in bond strength is achieved. Furthermore, the laser treatment is able to strip the fibres. The fibre stripping improves the bond strength compared to the already high standard of the reference process. The increase of the roughness and surface area is seen as the driving mechanism behind the further improvement. Opposed to the reference process, laser treatment is additionally capable of removing contaminations. The removal of contaminations is a considerable advantage of laser treatment, given the severe risk that is posed by contaminations. Though no clear evidence of a functionalisation was found, the chemical composition shows a high functionality without any contaminations and is therefore suitable for adhesive bonding. The main downside of the process is the physically induced interaction between the epoxy resin matrix and the N-IR laser and the consequential formation of cavities under matrix-rich areas. The cavities, though comparably small, can only be partially filled and could induce failure in the bond. Nevertheless, for all tested scarf ratios and lay-ups, an increase of the bond strength compared to the reference process was achieved. This shows the high potential of N-IR laser treatment for composite repair applications.', 'Kohlenstofffaserverstärkte Kunststoffe (CFK) werden in erheblichem Umfang als Werkstoff für Flugzeugstrukturen eingesetzt. Während ihrer Lebensdauer können Flugzeugstrukturen Schäden erleiden, die zur Wahrung der Flugsicherheit repariert werden müssen. Die leichtbau- und werkstoffgerechte Klebeschäftreparatur wird durch Entfernen des beschädigten Materials durch Fräsen und das anschließende Aufbringen eines Reparaturflickens hergestellt. Ein kritischer Schritt hierbei ist die Oberflächenbehandlung. In dieser Arbeit wurden die Auswirkungen der Nahinfrarot(N-IR)-Laser-Oberflächenbehandlung auf die Klebeigenschaften von gefrästem CFK untersucht. Die Laserbehandlung ist in der Lage, unerwünschte Fräspartikel von der Oberfläche zu entfernen. Dadurch wurde eine signifikante Steigerung der Klebfestigkeit erreicht. Zusätzlich bewirkt die Laserbehandlung eine Freilegung der Fasern. Dies verbessert die Klebfestigkeit gegenüber dem bereits hohen Wert des Referenzprozesses. Die Erhöhung der Rauheit und Vergrößerung der Oberfläche wird als treibender Mechanismus hinter der weitergehenden Verbesserung gesehen. Im Gegensatz zum Referenzverfahren ist die Laserbehandlung in der Lage, Kontaminationen zu entfernen. Die Entfernung von Kontaminationen ist ein wesentlicher Vorteil der Laserbehandlung angesichts des hohen Risikos, das von diesen ausgeht. Obwohl keine Hinweise auf eine Funktionalisierung beobachtet wurden, zeigt die Oberfläche eine hohe Funktionalität ohne Verunreinigungen und ist daher für eine Klebung geeignet. Der wesentliche Nachteil des Verfahrens ist die Wechselwirkung zwischen der Matrix und dem N-IR-Laser und die daraus resultierende Bildung von Kavitäten unter matrixreichen Bereichen. Die Kavitäten können nur teilweise gefüllt werden und könnten ein Versagen der Klebung verursachen. Dennoch konnte bei allen getesteten Konfigurationen eine Steigerung der Klebfestigkeit gegenüber dem Referenzprozess erreicht werden.

Numerical relativity initial data for neutron star binaries and the hyperbolic relaxation method,"Numerical Relativity Initial Data for Neutron Star Binaries and the Hyperbolic Relaxation Method. A new class of relaxation schemes for the solution of systems of elliptic partial differential equations is derived from a modification of the parabolic Jacobi relaxation scheme. The new scheme can be viewed as a formal embedding of the elliptic partial differential equations into a system of hyperbolic partial differential equations with damping. The hyperbolicity of the hyperbolic relaxation equations is examined and the implementation of the method in the hyperbolic relaxation code ""bamps"" is discussed. Furthermore the convergence properties investigated for simple model problems in terms of an analytical mode analysis and an experimental comparison to other numerical solution methods for elliptic partial differential equations. Subsequently the hyperbolic relaxation scheme is applied to the initial data problem in numerical relativity for the case of massless scalar fields, single neutron stars and binary neutron stars. For binary neutron stars a scheme avoiding adapted coordinates by formally extending the elliptic partial differential equations to regions outside the neutron stars is investigated. To improve the physical accuracy of initial data for neutron star binaries with spin an attempt is made to take into account terms that are neglected in current state-of-the-art formalisms. By investigation of additional constraints originating from the neglected terms that the current formalism would actually pose unphysical requirements on the solution.

Due to substantial maintenance and operating costs, the United States decommissioned the last of its calutrons in 1998, leading to demand for alternative methods of isotope separation. The work presented here suggests the promise for MAGIS as a viable alternative to the calutrons.The MAGIS technique combines optical pumping with a scalable magnetic field gradient to enrich atoms of a specific isotope in an atomic beam.

Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) symbiosis of metal resistant organisms can represent a beneficial association for the improvement of soil quality in order to re-establish vegetation in brownfields. Pine (Pinus sylvestris) growth in the presence of the ECM fungi Paxillus involutus and Pisolithus tinctorius was tested in regard to exposure at different heavy metal concentrations. Mycorrhized pine seedlings have been investigated as a bioremediation system by assessing metal uptake and distribution within plant tissues. Electron microscopy revealed metal accumulation on the surface of the colonized root, inside the root and inside the needle crown. The formation of biominerals was investigated by electron diffraction, and identified pyromorphite within plant tissue. The biominerals were extracellularly embedded in the plant cell wall with indications for mineralization during cell wall growth. Biomineralization potential was discussed in terms or bioreduction, biosorption and bioaccumulation processes that might have been involved by the investigated organisms. Since the bioremediation system proved its efficiency, the ecological implications of ECM associations have been highlighted for afforestation strategies of metal polluted sites.",gnd:4137352-2 gnd:4014873-7 gnd:4053964-7 gnd:4145884-9 gnd:4151671-0
Import and decomposition of dissolved organic carbon in pre-dams of drinking water reservoirs,"Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) depicts a key component in the aquatic carbon cycle as well as for drinking water production from surface waters. DOC concentrations increased in water bodies of the northern hemisphere in the last decades, posing ecological consequences and water quality problems. Within the pelagic zone of lakes and reservoirs, the DOC pool is greatly affected by biological activity as DOC is simultaneously produced and decomposed. This thesis aimed for a conceptual understanding of organic carbon cycling and DOC quality changes under differing hydrological and trophic conditions. Further, the occurrence of aquatic priming was investigated, which has been proposed as a potential process facilitating the microbial decomposition of stable allochthonous DOC within the pelagic zone. To study organic carbon cycling under different hydrological conditions, quantitative and qualitative investigations were carried out in three pre-dams of drinking water reservoirs exhibiting a gradient in DOC concentrations and trophic…",gnd:4058956-0 gnd:4627140-5

"Outburst floods from moraine-dammed lakes in the Himalayas : detection, frequency, and hazard","The Himalayas are a region that is most dependent, but also frequently prone to hazards from changing meltwater resources. This mountain belt hosts the highest mountain peaks on earth, has the largest reserve of ice outside the polar regions, and is home to a rapidly growing population in recent decades. One source of hazard has attracted scientific research in particular in the past two decades: glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) occurred rarely, but mostly with fatal and catastrophic consequences for downstream communities and infrastructure. Such GLOFs can suddenly release several million cubic meters of water from naturally impounded meltwater lakes. Glacial lakes have grown in number and size by ongoing glacial mass losses in the Himalayas. Theory holds that enhanced meltwater production may increase GLOF frequency, but has never been tested so far. The key challenge to test this notion are the high altitudes of >4000 m, at which lakes occur, making field work impractical. Moreover, flood waves can attenuate rapidly in mountain channels downstream, so that many GLOFs have likely gone unnoticed in past decades. Our knowledge on GLOFs is hence likely biased towards larger, destructive cases, which challenges a detailed quantification of their frequency and their response to atmospheric warming. Robustly quantifying the magnitude and frequency of GLOFs is essential for risk assessment and management along mountain rivers, not least to implement their return periods in building design codes.

Systematic design of microscope objectives,"The modern microscope objective is the most sophisticated optical component in light microscopes, providing high contrast images with diffraction-limited resolution. The design of microscope objectives has been developed for over a hundred of years. However, after 1970s, the review of advanced application-oriented systems is limited, and the design principles are not clear to most optical designers who are not the specialist from a few microscope manufacturers. To subtract off the hidden assumptions during the historical development and turn back to the intrinsic building blocks of the high numerical aperture (NA) systems, in this work, a systematic analysis and synthesis approach for microscope objectives is worked out, which is not found in available literature. The microscope objective patents are collected worldwide. Concentrating on the standardized objectives with color correction at least in the visible spectrum, a large system database is built up within Zemax/OpticStudioTM. According to a systematic review of the historical development, new classifications of the modern microscope objectives are proposed to understand the system complexity. Thereby, systematic analysis of the systems can be conducted to decouple the impact of aberration correction, application and manufacturing requests. Based on the decoupled results, the building blocks and design principles of the modern microscope objectives are systematically analyzed and summarized. Lens modules are sorted with respect to the general optical power distribution and individual structural lens groups. The reasons for many commonly used complicated structures are explained. Utilizing the lens modules, the microscope objective design can be more systematic. Both the modification of existing systems and the synthesis of new structures are realized, which give optical designers new ideas or possible opportunities to keep away from the restriction of other patents.",gnd:4132894-2 gnd:4039237-5

Vector valued Bohnenblust-Hille inequalities,"[""The Bohr-Bohnenblust-Hille theorem states that the maximal width of the strip on which a Dirichlet series converges uniformly but not absolutely equals 1/2. In fact Bohr in 1913 proved that S less or equal 1/2 asked for equality. In course of his investigation he discovered several deep connections between Dirichlet series and power series in infinitely many variables and, as a sort of by-product, he found his famous power series theorem. Bohnenblust and Hille in 1931 invented their (2m)/(m+1)-inequality in order to answer Bohr's absolute convergence problem in positive. We invent the new notion of coordinatewise multiple summing operators in Banach spaces and use it to give vector valued extensions of the multilinear and the polynomial Bohnenblust-Hille inequality.

Vulnerability assessment of nitrate leaching on the regional scale using isotope techniques,"Zusammenfassung: Groundwater is an important source of drinking water, but its quality is threatened by contamination with nitrate. In order to prevent groundwater contamination, knowledge about potential nitrate sources, their pathways and time lag between sources and drinking water wells is required. Still, i) simple methods to quantify nitrate fluxes are missing, ii) the applicability of stable isotopes of nitrate in nitrate source identification in grassland systems remains unknown, and iii) there is a lack of physically based modeling approaches focusing on the spatially resolved estimation of groundwater vulnerability to nitrate contamination. Thus, the objectives of the thesis are to i) quantify nitrate leaching in soils, ii) identify major sources of nitrate in aquifers, and iii) determine the intrinsic and nitrate specific aquifer vulnerability. The objectives were realized in a pre-alpine area with oligotrophic aquifers used for drinking water supply. Different isotopic and environmental tracers were used to understand the local hydrogeology and the fate of nitrate and related dynamic transformation processes. At farmed grassland sites, analysis of nitrate concentration in soil water below the root zone using suction cups was combined with groundwater recharge rates estimated from vertical deuterium profiles in soil to calculate nitrate fluxes. Stable isotopes of nitrate were analyzed in surface water, soil water and groundwater and compared with the distinct isotope composition of nitrate in potential sources. Local tritium concentrations were used in combination with a lumped-parameter model to calculate the mean residence times (MRTt) and MRTt distributions of local groundwater wells. The intrinsic and nitrate specific vulnerability of groundwater was spatially assessed (GIS) based on the approximation of the total mean residence time (MRT) and the residence time distribution as well as consulting data on nitrate leaching.Measured nitrate concentration below the root zone varies between 0 and 90 mg NO3- L-1. Estimated groundwater recharge rates cover a range of 430 to 926 mm yr-1. Nitrate leaching (0.2 to 41 kg NO3-N ha-1 yr-1) at grassland sites is highest in spring and fall. At farmed sites, nitrate leaching is positively related to fertilizer input rather than land use category (organic, conventional). Nitrate isotope values indicate that nitrate derive from ammonium nitrification of multiple sources, such as atmospheric deposition, mineral ...",gnd:4115398-4 gnd:4022369-3 gnd:4007420-1

Yet, many institutions still struggle to tap the potential of the large archives of reflectivity, as there is still much to understand about factors that contribute to measurement errors, one of which is calibration.

"From biotechnology to bioeconomy : policy transition, spatial implications, and regional path development","['This work scrutinises the policy shift in Germany with the change in leitmotif from biotechnology to bioeconomy and examines the associated implications at various levels. The emergence and implementation of innovation policy funding programmes show that the policy transition did not follow a linear sequence. Neither excessive prioritisation nor neglect of a selected sector can be confirmed in this analysis.  However, the policy shift from biotechnology to bioeconomy has not only consequences in terms of its content, but also affects the spatial distribution of R&D funding. Against the background of existing polarisation tendencies and the growing acknowledgement of inclusive innovation policy approaches, this study examines the importance the bioeconomy can assume in the reduction of regional disparities. In ‘organisationally thick’ regions, depending on the involvement of private actors, specialisation and regional branching can be observed. It is found that, for rural regions, the bioeconomy can be an appropriate tool for regional development, since other industries are often not present.', 'Wirtschaftsgeografie, Politik, Deutschland, Bioökonomie; Evolutionäre Wirtschaftsgeographie; Inklusive Politik; Innovationspolitik; Regional Disparitäten; Regionale Pfadentwicklung, Grand Societal Challenges; Sustainability Development Goals (SDG)']",gnd:4132813-9 gnd:4161414-8 gnd:4066446-6 gnd:4293657-3 gnd:7755732-3 gnd:4069491-4 gnd:4046514-7 gnd:4114020-5
Organisational and signalling cues in membranes,"Recently, a new class of membrane-shapers termed N-Ank proteins (Wolf et al., 2019) were defined by their ability to bind, sense, and shape the membrane via their N-Ank module, which consists of an amino(N)-terminal amphipathic helix and ankyrin repeats. N-Ank family of membrane-shapers is phylogenetically classified into two sub-families and Ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein (Ankrd) 24, an uncharacterised protein, was suggested to be in their smaller sub-family. Thus, this study unveiled that Ankrd24 isoform 6 (Ankrd24x6) is one of the expressed isoforms in brains of 8-week-old mice. Investigation of the N-Ank properties of Ankrd24x6 using in vitro reconstitution assays with liposomes showed that it is an N-Ank protein but with distinct characteristics. The N-Ank module of Ankrd24x6 binds and shape the membrane and displayed that the presence of the putative amphipathic helix is quintessential for its binding. The predicted seven ankyrin repeats in Ankrd24x6 displayed lack of binding to the liposomes irrespective of their curvature. This property of Ankrd24x6 is distinct compared to the other members of the N-Ank superfamily which showed that the ankyrin repeats alone preferred higher curvature liposomes. Ankrd24x6 is also capable of oligomerising as it demonstrated self association, which was mediated by the predicted coiled coil domains. Another interesting feature of Ankrd24x6 is the presence of a proline-rich motif via which it showed binding to the syndapin I protein. Syndapin I is involved in diverse crucial biological processes like synaptic vesicle recycling, cytoskeletal remodelling, dendritogenesis and ciliogenesis because it is capable of binding and shaping the membranes and can additionally interact with various proteins. ...",gnd:4167790-0 gnd:4041649-5
Study on the growth anomaly in Al-Ni melts under gravity and microgravity conditions,"In this thesis the solidification behaviour of different Al-Ni alloys is studied by means of the electromagnetic levitation (EML) technique. Of special interest is an anomaly of the growth behaviour, a decreasing solidification velocity for increasing undercooling. However, according to theoretical considerations the growth velocity should increase with increasing undercooling. In order to study the anomaly, levitation experiments on earth (1g) as well as levitation experiments using the electromagnetic levitation facility on board the International Space Station (ISS) are carried out. The electromagnetic levitator on board the ISS (ISS-EML) provides a unique processing environment in microgravity µg where external influences are severely reduced. The new results obtained in µg and 1g show no difference in terms of the growth velocity. However, the high-speed video data used to capture the solidification show an unexpected behaviour. The visible front consists of circular features which grow and consecutively form, referred to as scales. The measured front velocity is therefore a superposition of formation of new and growth of the existing scales. Accompanying microstructure analyses of samples processed on earth show that each scale corresponds to a nucleation event. It is concluded that the observed front is not a dendritic growth front, but a nucleation front. This resolves the contradiction between experimental results and theoretical considerations since the theoretical approaches are valid only for dendritic growth fronts. For a better understanding of its behaviour, the nucleation front is studied in greater detail. The number and size of the scales is measured. It is found that for an increasing undercooling fewer, yet larger scales form. The loss of nuclei is not compensated by the larger area, and therefore leads to a decrease of the front velocity. The velocity of the dendrites cannot be measured due to the opacity of the melt.",gnd:4199240-4 gnd:4264210-3 gnd:4140191-8

Funktionelle und strukturelle Charakterisierung von Varianten des respiratorischen Komplex I,"['Zusammenfassung: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are suspected to be involved in the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson\'s disease and Alzheimer\'s disease. In addition, ROS is ascribed an important role in the aging process. The NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, also called respiratory complex I, is the most important source of ROS in the mitochondrion. The enzyme complex couples the electron transfer from NADH to ubiquinone with the translocation of protons across the membrane. Because of its simpler structure of the bacterial complex I is considered as a model system for the eukaryotic complex. The Escherichia coli complex I consists of 13 subunits, which are named NuoA to NuoN. The enzyme carries nine iron-sulfur (Fe/S) clusters and one flavin mononucleotide (FMN) as cofactors. In this work, specific questions concerning the mechanism of complex I were clarified by characterization of site-directed mutants. Effects of mutations on the enzymatic activity were tested using the E. coli complex I. The structural changes of the mutations were, if possible, characterized by a soluble subcomplex consisting of subunits NuoE and F of the Aquifex aeolicus complex I. By mutagenesis of Glu183(NuoF) and characterization of variants, this amino acid has been identified as a key position for the substrate discrimination of NADH and NADPH by complex I. The increased ROS production of the variants during NADH consumption could be explained by the structure of the A. aeolicus NuoEF variant E185D(NuoF) with bound NAD+. The mutation Tyr204Cys(NuoF) was detected in a patient suffering from Leigh-like syndrome. The cause of this disease has been studied by mutagenesis of E. coli complex I. The characterized variants showed up to 80% reduction in catalytic efficiency and 13-fold increase in ROS production. In a cooperation project with the group of Dr. Judy Hirst (MRC , Cambridge ), the midpoint potential of the Fe/S cluster N1a was lowered up to 100 mV by site-directed mutagenesis. N1a of the produced E. coli complex I variant could not be reduced by NADH. This led to an increased H2O2 production by 60 % and shows the functional significance of this cluster as a protection against increased ROS production. The structures of NuoEF with bound substrate and product show a conformational change of the peptide bond of Glu95(NuoF). This reorientation seems to be a kind of ""product ejection mechanism"".

Zusätzlich wird ROS eine wesentliche Rolle beim Alterungsprozess zugeschrieben. Die NADH:Ubichinon Oxidoreduktase, auch respiratorischer Komplex I genannt, gilt als die bedeutendste Quelle von ROS im Mitochondrium. Der Enzymkomplex koppelt den Elektronentransfer von NADH auf Ubichinon mit der Translokation von Protonen über die Membran. Aufgrund seines einfacheren Aufbaus wird der bakterielle Komplex I als Modellsystem für den eukaryotischen Komplex angesehen. Der Escherichia coli Komplex I besteht aus 13 Untereinheiten, die mit NuoA bis NuoN bezeichnet werden und trägt neun Eisen-Schwefel (Fe/S)-Zentren sowie ein Flavinmononukleotid (FMN) als Kofaktoren. In dieser Arbeit wurden spezifische Fragen zum Mechanismus des Komplex I durch Charakterisierung ortsgerichteter Mutanten geklärt. Auswirkungen der Mutationen auf die enzymatische Aktivität wurden mit dem E. coli Komplex I untersucht. Die strukturellen Änderungen der Mutationen wurden, falls möglich, mit dem löslichen Subkomplex aus den Untereinheiten NuoE und F des Aquifex aeolicus Komplex I charakterisiert.  Durch Mutagenese des Glu183(NuoF) und durch Charakterisierung der Varianten konnte diese Position als Schlüsselposition für die Substratunterscheidung von NADH und NADPH durch Komplex I identifiziert werden.

Optimization strategies for Markov chain Monte Carlo inversion of seismic tomographic data,"Probabilistic approach to inverse problem by means of Monte Carlo simulation is a computationally intensive approach whose feasibility has shown to be directly connected with the availability of computational resources and optimization. This study aims to introduce at first some fundamental theoretical aspects and to focus on the issue of optimization of McMC algorithms. We developed a transdimensional inversion scheme in the framework offered by the established deterministic inversion code simulr16. The issues of optimization and performance improvement were tackled by means of parallel independent realizations of the sampling process in addition to a staggered grid approach. The inverse model parametrization of the simulr16 code in conjunction with transdimensional McMC sampling, provided an affordable and reliable inversion strategy able to offer naturally smooth solutions equipped with a quantitative uncertainty estimation. Our probabilistic inversion method was tested on synthetic data and then applied on the inversion of a field data set from the Salzach valley (Austria). The structures recovered with our approach are compatible with those obtained with other well established methods. Metropolis-Hastings-based McMC algorithms require a careful tuning in order for the model space to be optimally sampled. Sub-optimal scaling of the size of random walk steps for Markov samplers leads to less efficient chains that require longer runtimes. We proposed a multivariate updating scheme that, using information carried by the model resolution matrix, proved to improve the performances of the classical M-H proposal. Trade-off relations between model parameters were obtained from the model resolution matrix and implemented in our updating scheme. McMC and non-stochastic tests revealed an improvement in performance in terms of increased acceptance rate and enhanced mixing properties.",gnd:4240945-7 gnd:4379341-1
Emission of Radio Waves in Particle Showers : Validation of Microscopic Simulations with the SLAC T-510 Experiment and their Potential in the Future Square Kilometre Array,"['Introduction -- Cosmic Rays -- Modeling of Radio Emission from Particle\\Air Showers -- Testing Predictions for Radio Emission from Particle Showers -- Modeling the Radio Emission from a Particle Shower -- Comparison of Microscopic Simulations to Data of the T-510 Experiment -- Detecting Cosmic Rays with SKA1-low -- Conclusions.', 'This thesis offers the first laboratory validation of microscopic simulations of radio emission from particle showers, including a detailed description of the simulation study. It presents a potential future avenue for resolving the mass composition of cosmic rays via radio detection of air showers.  Particle showers are created from cascading interactions when high-energy particles collide with matter, e.g. with air in the case of cosmic radiation, or with a particle detector in the case of experiments at CERN. These showers can consist of billions of particles, mostly electrons, positrons and photons. They emit radio waves when the absorbing medium is in a magnetic field, and this radio emission can be used as a novel means of detecting and drawing inferences on the shower and the primary particle. The new method is currently being established in cosmic ray research, where large antenna arrays may soon replace or complement traditional particle detectors.  In thi s study, a complete microscopic simulation of a radio-emission experiment conducted at Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC), Stanford/USA, is performed, and the underlying physical models are validated. The model is subsequently applied to the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) project, which is a large interferometer for radio astronomy. It is demonstrated that the SKA, with some modifications, might also be used for cosmic ray research based on radio detection of high-energy particles from the cosmos.']",gnd:4165371-3 gnd:4048204-2 gnd:4148259-1 gnd:4297495-1
Solar activity reconstruction from historical observations of sunspots,"The solar activity and its consequences affect space weather and Earth’s climate. The solar activity exhibits a cyclic behaviour with a period of about 11 years. The solar cycle properties are governed by the dynamo taking place in the interior of the Sun, and they are distinctive. Extending the knowledge about solar cycle properties into the past is essential for understanding the solar dynamo and forecasting space weather. It can be acquired through the analysis of historical sunspot drawings. Sunspots are the dark areas, which are associated with strong magnetic fields, on the solar surface. Sunspots are the oldest and longest available observed features of solar activity. One of the longest available records of sunspot drawings is the collection by Samuel Heinrich Schwabe during 1825–1867. The sunspot sizes measured from digitized Schwabe drawings are not to scale and need to be converted into physical sunspot areas. We employed a statistical approach assuming that the area distribution of sunspots was the same in the 19th century as it was in the 20th century. Umbral areas for about 130 000 sunspots observed by Schwabe were obtained. The annually averaged sunspot areas correlate reasonably well with the sunspot number.

Nitrogen-doped and porous carbons towards new energy storage mechanisms for supercapacitors with high energy density,"Supercapacitors are electrochemical energy storage devices with rapid charge/discharge rate and long cycle life. Their biggest challenge is the inferior energy density compared to other electrochemical energy storage devices such as batteries. Being the most widely spread type of supercapacitors, electrochemical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) store energy by electrosorption of electrolyte ions on the surface of charged electrodes. As a more recent development, Na-ion capacitors (NICs) are expected to be a more promising tactic to tackle the inferior energy density due to their higher-capacity electrodes and larger operating voltage. The charges are simultaneously stored by ion adsorption on the capacitive-type cathode surface and via faradic process in the battery-type anode, respectively. Porous carbon electrodes are of great importance in these devices, but the paramount problems are the facile synthetic routes for high-performance carbons and the lack of fundamental understanding of the energy storage mechanisms.

Electrochemical characterisation of the redox behaviour of quinoide components in membrane models,"['The leading idea of this thesis is to study the effects of (i) membrane composition and (ii) membrane environment (aqueous phases) on the redox properties of membrane-confined redox active compounds. For solutions, it is known since long, how strong solvents affect the redox properties of dissolved redox active species. However, for membranes this question has not yet been addressed, although it can be supposed that such effects may be important to understand the role of membrane-confined redox active compounds in biological systems. To interrogate this problem, a monolayer model was chosen. It consists of a lipid monolayer with embedded menaquinones on mercury electrodes. Since ion transfer across membranes is also a crucial question, in the first part of this project, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) was studied as a new redox probe for transferring anions and cation between an organic and an aqueous phase.

Modifikation optischer Nichtlinearitäten in Silizium,"['Silicon is a favored material in the field of photonics because already existing technology from microelectronic industry can be used for the production of the respective devices. For the realization of active devices like switches, modulators and converter materials with nonlinear optical properties are needed. Unfortunately, silicon does not posses significant nonlinear optical properties. In this thesis, two different approaches for the creation of a nonlinear optical susceptibility in silicon have been investigated. The first approach deals with ""strained silicon"", where strain is introduced into the silicon device to break the silicons centrosymmetry, thus creating a second order optical susceptibility in the silicon. In the second part of this thesis, slotted nanobeam microresonators infiltrated with a nonlinear material have been investigated numerically.

Histone deacetylase inhibitors regulate the proteasomal degradation of oncoproteins,"Leukemogenesis is often linked to fusion proteins generated by chromosomal translocation products. Examples are AML1-ETO and PML-RAR? which contribute to the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The work presented here reveals the novel insight that the turnover of both, AML1-ETO and PML-RAR?, depends on the HDACi-inducible ubiquitin conjugase UBCH8 and the ubiquitin ligase SIAH1. Beyond showing that HDACi promote the degradation of oncoproteins, this work reveals that the ubiquitin ligase RLIM equally is a substrate for SIAH1. Thus, a formerly unknown hierarchical order of ubiquitin ligases affects the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Since constitutively activated mutant FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3-ITD) causally contributes to leukemic transformation and is frequently found in conjunction with AML1-ETO and PML-RAR? in AML patients, it was also tested whether HDACi attenuate FLT3-ITD. Indeed, UBCH8 together with SIAH1 interact in a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent way with FLT3-ITD and promote its proteasomal degradation. Accordingly, unstimulated wild-type FLT3 is hardly affected by HDACi. Thus, UBCH8, which has been implicated primarily in nuclear processes, could be identified as a novel important HDACi-inducible modulator of FLT3-ITD stability and leukemic cell survival. In summary, I could demonstrate in various AML cell lines and heterologous expression systems that UBCH8 and SIAH1 physically interact with and target FLT3-ITD, AML1-ETO, PML-RARα, and RLIM for proteasomal degradation. This work furthermore provides a deeper understanding on how enzymes promoting proteasomal degradation are regulated and how they interact with each other as well as with their cancer-relevant substrates. Conclusions presented here reveal novel biochemical mechanisms and molecular networks.

Moisture availability in the Tangra Yumco region during the Late Quaternary and the implications for the precipitation regime on the southern Tibetan Plateau,"It is generally accepted that the Asian summer monsoon systems as well as the westerlies affect the precipitation regime on the Tibetan Plateau. The spatial and temporal variability of the monsoon has, however, been under strong discussion in recent years. The question arose whether the spatial and temporal monsoonal dynamics show a generally homogenous or heterogeneous pattern. To investigate the temporal and spatial variability of the monsoonal pattern three lakes along an east-west-transect on the southern Tibetan Plateau including Nam Co, Tangra Yumco, and Taro Co were targeted within the framework of the DFG priority program 1372 “TiP – Tibetan Plateau: Formation–Climate–Ecosystems”.

Negative ions and operation modes in capacitively coupled RF oxygen discharges,"['The electron and negative ion densities in an asymmetric capacitively coupled low-pressure RF plasma in oxygen were systematically studied and compared to the electropositive argon RF plasma during continuous and pulsed power input. This work presents the careful design and realization of a non-invasive 160.28 GHz Gaussian beam microwave interferometry (MWI) as an innovative diagnostic tool. MWI directly provides the line integrated electron density without any model assumption. The high microwave frequency enables one to accurately describe the microwave free space propagation by means of Gaussian beam theory. The microwave interferometer is simultaneously coupled with laser photodetachment to experimentally determine the negative ion density in the CCRF oxygen discharge. This is the ?rst time that both diagnostics were combined in low-pressure capacitively coupled RF oxygen plasmas. This thesis ?rst presents comprehensive measurements of the steady state line integrated electron density in dependence on RF power and pressure for an argon and oxygen plasma. For both gases the electron density increases with RF power. However, the line integrated electron density in oxygen is about a factor 3 to 10 smaller than in argon. The reduced electron density is accompanied by a high number of negative ions, which exceeded the electron density and resulted in a high electronegative mode.

Some properties of isotropic Brownian and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck flows,"In this thesis we study some macroscopic properties of isotropic Brownian flows (IBF) and isotropic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck flows (IOUF) in $ \R^d $ with $ d\ge2 $. \\ IBFs were studied extensively by Baxendale and Harris and independently by Le Jan. They are a very natural family of stochastic flows with independent and stationary increments and with a distribution, which is invariant with respect to spatial rigid motions on $ \R^d $. First we consider the asymptotics of the evolution of a smooth rectifiable curve under the action of an IBF. We provide almost sure lower and upper exponential bounds for the length of the curve and show that in case the top Lyapunov exponent is strictly negative the lower bound is attained with positive probability. In the case of a positive Lyapunov exponent we do not know if these bounds are attained, however we give a sufficient condition concerning the uniformity of the spatial spreading'' of the curve, under which the upper bound is attained a.s.. This might help the further research on the problem. \\ Further we consider the evolution of the volume of a set under the action of an IBF. This problem has also been studied by Le Jan, Darling and Kunita. Le Jan and Darling proved that in the case of a strictly negative top Lyapunov exponent the volume of a bounded set vanishes almost surely with time (even if its diameter grows). Le Jan has also shown that in the case of a positive Lyapunov exponent the volume does not vanish asymptotically with strictly positive probability. We show that if the IBF is near to the volume preserving case then the volume of an open set does persist (i.e.~does not converge to zero) almost surely. We also study the spatial distribution of the volume of an open set moved by the flow and prove that on a large scale there is a certain kind of asymptotic normality ...",gnd:4128328-4 gnd:4845858-2
"Synthesis and characterization of ten new 1D, 2D and 3D-coordination polymers with oxygen or nitrogen containing ligands by using different metal cations","The present work deals with the preparation and characterization of ten new coordination polymers prepared from different metal ions and ligands by different synthetic methods. In addition to the structural characterization of these compounds by means of X-ray singlecrystal diffraction data, the focus is on the consideration of thermal and spectroscopic properties. The new silver coordination polymer exhibits very unique, robust and interesting polymeric structure with high thermal stability. Two new lanthanide coordination polymers (neodymium and samarium) have been synthesized with H2FDA = 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid in DMF as solvent via capped tube method. The compounds are iso-structural and exhibit threedimensional coordination polymers. The goal of using DMF as pure solvent instead of mixture of water and other solvents was to synthesize new coordination polymer which might show very intensive luminescence effect. The investigation has turned out that these compounds emerge no significant luminescence effect. As it has been reported in previous works in which the H2FDA = 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid was used for construction of lanthanide coordination polymers in water as solvent, however the compounds have exposed very interesting luminescence properties [229‒230]. A new cerium coordination polymer has been produced with ligand (H2pdc = 3,5-pyrazoledicarboxylic acid) under solvothermal condition in DMF as solvent. Indeed, ligand (H2pdc = 3,5-pyrazoledicarboxylic acid) is very versatile to construct coordination network by various coordination modes. Three copper (I) coordination polymers have been successfully synthesized via solvent diffusion technique in test tube. The compounds all display 1D polymeric structure with rather similar coordination environment around metal ions. Moreover, they are very stable against temperature rising. The compounds [Pb3(CH3COO)2(N3)4]n and [Na2Pb2(CH3COO)6]n were synthesized under same synthesis conditions and starting materials but with different metal salt and ligand ratios. Interestingly, the both products show three-dimentional frameworks, however they expose different coordination structures. Actually, the investigation shows that the changing metal salt and ligand ratio can result in the formation different structures of coordination networks, although they have been produced under same reaction conditions. Compound [Pb(DHBDA)]n has been made with ligand 2,5-Dihydroxy-1,4-benzenediacetic acid which has been reported in very few works for constructing coordination compounds.",gnd:4323240-1 gnd:4219283-3 gnd:4137334-0

Influence of plant diversity on soil organic carbon storage and microbial transformation of organic carbon in soils,"Increasing plant diversity is known to be important for ecosystem functioning and an increase in soil organic carbon storage. The link between aboveground plant diversity and belowground diversity is currently under discussion. Furthermore, the mechanisms by which aboveground diversity impacts storage as well as the sustainability of storage are still not well understood. Addressing these issues the thesis contributes to a better understanding of the impact of plant diversity on belowground ecosystem functioning. For investigations the field site of The Jena Experiment was used. The species pool comprises 60 species common to the Central European Molinio-Arrhenatheretum grasslands. Between 2002 and 2007 organic carbon and nitrogen were stored in the top and sub soil. In the top soil the main drivers for storage were soil texture and plant diversity. While the root input was not important for storage in the top soil, it was found to significantly affect storage in the sub soil, where the system seemed to be input-limited. Due to the increased substrate use efficiency of microorganisms in the sub soil, the major part of the input was transformed and stored. Microbial transformation of input and sustainable sequestration of carbon was confirmed by the results of density fractionations. Soil microbial community was characterised by phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA). Although the abiotic factors were found to have an impact on microbial abundance, increased plant diversity lead to increased amounts of soil microbial biomass. For soil microbial biomass not only the amount of plant biomass input but also the quality and heterogeneity of input was important. The same result was found for the microbial composition and indicates that increasing diversity increases niche complementarity of soil microorganisms.",gnd:4370378-1 gnd:4183262-0 gnd:4601495-0 gnd:4309007-2

Semiconductor nanowire based coherent light sources : temporal dynamics and tunability,"Semiconductor nanowires (NWs) offer exceptional optical properties such as efficient waveguiding of light despite their subwavelength diameter. These properties are strongly related to the semiconductor material and their morphology. Additionally, semiconductor NWs inherently offer all basic components of a laser system including robust, high optical gain and a beneficial Fabry-Pérot resonator structure. Thus, they are considered as one of the smallest coherent light sources available for different visionary concepts in recent research on nanophotonics, nanosensing and nanspectroscopy. Laser oscillations in single NWs have only been achieved in a pulsed operation mode so far, as the off times between the optical pump pulses allows the thermal budget introduced by the optical pumping to dissipate in order to avoid a successive material degradation. In order to establish the continuous wave (cw) emission mode in single NWs, a semiconductor material of exceptional high optical gain and an excellent NW resonator morphology is required. Both challenges can be accomplished by using CdS NWs synthesized by the vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism using Sn as catalyst. Knowing the fundamental laser dynamics of semiconductor NWs will enable the exploitation of their full potential as nanoscaled coherent light sources. The respective time scales for laser onset time and pulse width are in the range of few hundred femtoseconds up to few picoseconds and can be measured by a novel ‘double-pump’ technique. In addition, both characteristic times can be adjusted by a proper choice of semiconductor material, pump energy and optical configuration. The field distribution within a NW laser can be adjusted between single and multi-transverse mode operation by varying the NW diameter. Thin NWs below the critical diameter for multimode waveguiding emit laser emission of the fundamental mode, whereas NWs with larger diameters clearly show multimode operation. Furthermore, the transverse mode structure strongly affects the light-matter interaction and the NW laser dynamics.",gnd:4707308-1 gnd:4190864-8 gnd:4034610-9 gnd:4147108-8 gnd:4158814-9
Modeling and understanding dynamics of charged particles in the Earth's inner magnetosphere,"The Earth's inner magnetosphere is a very dynamic system, mostly driven by the external solar wind forcing exerted upon the magnetic field of our planet. Disturbances in the solar wind, such as coronal mass ejections and co-rotating interaction regions, cause geomagnetic storms, which lead to prominent changes in charged particle populations of the inner magnetosphere - the plasmasphere, ring current, and radiation belts. Satellites operating in the regions of elevated energetic and relativistic electron fluxes can be damaged by deep dielectric or surface charging during severe space weather events. Predicting the dynamics of the charged particles and mitigating their effects on the infrastructure is of particular importance, due to our increasing reliance on space technologies. The dynamics of particles in the plasmasphere, ring current, and radiation belts are strongly coupled by means of collisions and collisionless interactions with electromagnetic fields induced by the motion of charged particles.

The Edelstein effect, the generation of a homogeneous spin density by an electric field in systems with broken inversion symmetry, is discussed for Rashba and Dresselhaus systems and topological insulators. Anisotropies modify the orientation of the current-induced spin density as well as its magnitude. For Rashba systems without time-reversal symmetry an intrinsic Edelstein effect is discussed. Weyl semimetals are predicted to provide an enormous Edelstein efficiency. The chiral anomaly, the nonconservation of chiral charge due to external nonorthogonal magnetic and electric fields, can be realized in Weyl semimetals and leads to a negative longitudinal magnetoresistance.

Particle trapping with functionalized hybrid optical fibers,"Understanding processes on sub-micron scales that are obscured from the observer’s naked eye represents a long cherished desire of mankind. Unfortunately, single particle studies are time demanding and suffer from Brownian motion, which thus limits their practicability and range of applications. Optical and electrical trapping, however, both awarded with a Nobel prize, represent two sophisticated and widely applied solutions allowing for controlled access to individual particles via almost the entire room angle. Particle trapping via optical fibers in principle provides a flexible and low-cost photonic platform enabling remotely operable applications within difficult to reach environments, including in situ and in vivo scenarios. The microtechnologically functionalized tip of a hybrid optical fiber (HOF), in particular, which in contrast to conventional optical fibers incorporates additional materials, offers a unique platform for implementing electromagnetic, i.e., optical and electrical, fields that are essentially required for the trapping of particles and unavailable by standard fibers alone. Within the scope of this work, three unique implementations of HOF tip-based particle traps, which in detail rely on integrating a liquid channel, a pure silica section and metallic wires for functionalizing the fibers, are demonstrated, discussed, and compared to state-of-the-art concepts. First, the principles of optical phenomena, the motion of microscopic objects and influences of confinements including different particle trapping mechanisms, as well as required methods for analyzing and characterizing fiber-based particle traps are introduced. Subsequently, three unique concepts, which in detail consist of a dual fiber focus trap, a single meta-fiber trap and a fiber point Paul trap, and effectively represent two optical and one electrical trap, are discussed and compared with respect to current implementations. ...",gnd:4643033-7 gnd:4167589-7

Process-based modelling of the methane balance in periglacial landscapes,"A detailed process-based methane module for the global land surface scheme JSBACH has been developed that is general enough to be applied in permafrost regions as well as wetlands outside permafrost areas. Methane production, oxidation and transport by ebullition, diffusion and plants are represented. Oxygen has been explicitly incorporated into diffusion, transport by plants, bulk soil oxidation and rhizospheric oxidation. Permafrost and wetland soils show special behaviour, e.g. variable soil pore space due to freezing/thawing or water table depths due to changing soil water content. This was integrated directly into the methane-related processes. A detailed application at the Samoylov polygonal tundra site, Lena River Delta, was used for evaluation purposes, which shows differences in the importance of the several processes and in the methane dynamics under varying soil moisture, ice and temperature conditions during different seasons and on the two different microsites, the elevated moist polygonal rim and the depressed wet polygonal centre. The evaluation shows sufficiently good agreement with field observations despite the module was not specifically calibrated to these data. In a second step, an enhanced version of JSBACH, including an updated methane module, was used for regional future climate experiments. The changes concern hydrology, carbon decomposition, methane production, order of the transport processes and plant transport. A new transport process was included, the diffusion through snow. The updated model was applied at the larger area of the Lena River Delta. Detailed analyses of soil respiration and methane process fluxes, their spatial distribution as well as changes with time and in the seasonal behaviour are presented. They show the relevance of methane compared to the carbon dioxide fluxes, the pattern of regions with favourable conditions for methane emissions as well as the increase of fluxes and emission season length due to climate change.",gnd:4129794-5 gnd:4286529-3

All these theorems have much in common. fRoughly speaking, they say that a function belongs to some function space if, and only if, it can be decomposed into the sum of products of coefficients and corresponding building blocks, where the coefficients belong to an appropriate sequence space. These decomposition theorems estabilisha veryusefulconnection between function and sequence spaces. We use them in the study of the decay of entropy numbers of compact embeddings between two function spaces of dominating mixed smoothness reducingthis problem to the same question on the sequence space level.

Dynamic coronal mass ejection processes and magnetic reconnection,"The Sun is the nearest star to the Earth. It consists of an interior and an atmosphere. The convection zone is the outermost layer of the solar interior. A flux rope may emerge as a coherent structure from the convection zone into the solar atmosphere or be formed by magnetic reconnection in the atmosphere. A flux rope is a bundle of magnetic field lines twisting around an axis field line, creating a helical shape by which dense filament material can be supported against gravity. The flux rope is also considered as the key structure of the most energetic phenomena in the solar system, such as coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and flares. These magnetic flux ropes can produce severe geomagnetic storms. In particular, to improve the ability to forecast space weather, it is important to enrich our knowledge about the dynamic formation of  flux ropes and the underlying physical mechanisms that initiate their eruption, such as a CME.

Neutral Atom Imaging Using a Pulsed Electromagnetic Lens,"['This dissertation describes the design, construction, and characterization of a new type of aberration-corrected, neutral-atom lens. Atom beam control plays a crucial role in many different fields, ranging from fundamental physics research and materials science to applied nanotechnology. Despite this, atom-optical elements like lenses and mirrors remain relatively underdeveloped compared to their counterparts in other optics fields. Although aberration correction is addressed quite comprehensively in photon and electron lenses, no credible research efforts have yet produced the same technology for neutral atoms. This thesis reports on progress towards a neutral atom imaging device that will be useful in a range of applications, including nanofabrication and surface microscopy. It presents a novel technique for improving refractive power and correcting chromatic aberration in atom lenses based on a fundamental paradigm shift from continuous, two-dimensional focusing to a pulsed, three-dimensional approach. Simulations of this system suggest that it will pave the way towards the long-sought goal of true atom imaging on the nanoscale. The thesis describes the construction of a prototype lens, and shows that all of the technological requirements for the proposed system are easily satisfied. Using metastable neon from a supersonic source, the prototype was characterized for three different focal lengths and a diverse range of apertures.

Numerical studies of higher-dimensional localized black holes and holographic Weyl semimetals,"In our everyday lives, we experience three spatial dimensions and a fourth dimension of time. Neverthe-less, several intricate problems of modern physics may be mastered with the introduction of additional dimensions, including the hierarchy problem and the unification of the fundamental forces. Furthermore, dualities between certain strongly coupled quantum field theories and particular gravitational theories in higher dimensions were conjectured based on string theory, which generically comes with the premise of extra dimensions. Specifically, the AdS/CFT correspondence or rather gauge/gravity duality motivated the study of a wide variety of higher dimensional gravitational theories with additional matter. The first part of this thesis covers the numerical construction of localized black holes in five, six and ten dimensional Kaluza-Klein theories. We focus on static, asymptotically flat vacuum solutions of Einstein’s field equations with one periodic compact dimension. Our study concentrates on the critical regime, where the poles of the localized black holes are about to merge. We utilize a well adapted multi-domain pseudo-spectral scheme for obtaining high accuracy results and investigate the phase diagram of the localized solutions far beyond previous results. A spiral phase space structure is found for the five and six dimensional setups which matches to the results that were recently obtained for non-uniform black strings. On the contrary, the phase space structure of the ten dimensional configuration exhibits no spiraling behavior of the thermodynamical quantities. These critical exponents were extracted from the numerical data of the aforementioned configurations and show an excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions. In the second part of this thesis, the AdS/CFT correspondence is employed for studying strongly coupled Weyl semimetals. More concretely, we numerically investigate the effects of inhomogenities within a holographic Weyl semimetal by using a pseudo-spectral scheme, including interfaces of Weyl semimetals and the impact of time independent disorder. When studying interfaces between differentWeyl semimetal phases, we observe the appearance of an electric current, that is restricted to the interface in the presence of an electric chemical potential. The related integrated current is universal in the sense that it only depends on the topology of the phases. These results may shed some light on anomalous transport for inhomogeneous magnetic fields. As another point, we study the effects of time independent one-dimensional disorder on the holographic Weyl semimetal quantum phase transition (QPT), with a particular focus on the quantum critical region. We observe the smearing of the sharp QPT linked to the appearance of rare regions where the order parameter is locally non-zero. We discuss the role of the disorder correlation and we compare our results to expectations from condensed matter theory at weak coupling. We also analyze the interplay of finite temperature and disorder.",gnd:4224276-9 gnd:4202326-9 gnd:7752120-1 gnd:4158819-8 gnd:4195351-4 gnd:4338132-7 gnd:4025643-1 gnd:4053793-6 gnd:4148259-1 gnd:4174149-3
Multi-scale 3D virtual histology via phase-contrast X-ray tomography with synchrotron radiation,"To this day, the standard method for investigating biological tissue with cellular resolution is the examination under a light microscope, first denoted as histology by Karl Meyer in 1819. Despite the enormous success and importance of histology, it has two major disadvantages. Firstly, the specimen must be physically cut into thin sections due to the limited penetrating power of optical light, and secondly, additional staining of the specimen is required to achieve sufficient image contrast. Both disadvantages can be overcome by the non-destructive method of propagation-based X-ray phase-contrast tomography. While the mechanism of phase-contrast provides sufficient image contrast to image single cells, a tomographic imaging scheme with penetrating X-rays allows for an undamaged sample by virtually slicing the reconstructed 3D sample volume. In this work, the holotomography setup of the synchrotron endstation „GINIX“ (The Göttingen Instrument for Nanoscale-Imaging with X-Rays) was extended to a multi-scale X-ray phase-contrast tomography setup suitable for 3D virtual histology by adding two acquisition schemes. Compared to the existing setup, the first additional scheme is a propagation-based microtomography setup, which enlarges the reconstructed 3D volumes by a factor of approx. 64 at a fraction of the acquisition time (ca. 2 min). The second additional scheme aims for higher resolutions. To this end, the X-ray waveguide illumination was combined with photon counting detector with a large field of view and a novel phase reconstruction scheme, which is based on iterative farfield phase retrieval without an „empty-beam correction“ in the detector plane.",gnd:4184235-2 gnd:4174161-4 gnd:4150634-0 gnd:4072532-7 gnd:4078351-0

It conducted a census of 116 households in a particular village. There are three focuses. First, it examines the determinants of participation in tourism sector. Second, it investigates the effect of participation in tourism activities on household income change and poverty exit. Third, it simulates the direct and indirect effects of tourism price increase on income generation and income distribution in the village.

Towards sustainable development by new town planning : case study of Mazandaran Province of Iran,"['The New Town planning concept was evaluated as an alternative solution for regulating imbalanced urban-rural growth in the Mazandaran province of Iran. The research was conducted in three main aspects. Firstly, local development through creation of small- scale enterprises with low-tech solutions was studied by analysing several small-scale businesses. Secondly, human well-being assessment was conducted in the Kandelous village by considering housing, earning and job, work-life balance, education, environmental quality, health, civic engagement and governance, personal security, social connections, happiness, and life satisfaction topics. Thirdly, the study area was assessed to identify suitable place for creating New Town settlement by using an integrated GIS-AHP technique that was followed by a validation step using high resolution Google Earth images and a field study survey. It was found that small-scale business with low-tech solutions can support a suitable quality of life for local people including a suitable work-life balance. However, this balance highly depends on management skills rather than size of business. In all studied cases, a strong link between business and social development was identified. In all described cases several socio-economic-environmental achievements were detected that are useful for application in other villages. The conducted human well-being assessment in the Kandelous village shows that the surveyed people are happy and satisfied with their life in the village. Moreover, we have detected high well-being status in different topics such as social connections, civic engagement, work- life balance, health, employment rate, and environmental quality. Thus, small-scale settlements can not only play a role in ecological functionality of the region but also can offer an attractive life for people. However, expectations of people about life have a key role in the life satisfaction of people. The LSA assessment indicated that 163.29 Km2 (0.68%) of the study area is highly suitable for creation of New Town settlement. While 2,418.79 Km2 (10.15 %) is moderately suitable, 2,749.06 Km2 (11.53 %) is marginally suitable land, 1,931.86 Km2 (8.10 %) is currently not suitable, 28.38 Km2 (0.12%) is permanently unsuitable. Slope was identified as an important topographical restriction factor in the proposed decision support model, whereas approximately 53.25% of total area was classified as very steep area (30-500 degree). The distribution of existing farms among the suitability classless was determined in 24,000 km2, that was randomly selected. approximately 94 percent of highly suitable, 78 percent of moderately suitable, and 16 percent of marginally suitable lands were used for agricultural activities. At a country level, Miyankaleh, Miyandrodbozorgh, Roodpayshomali, Kalarastaghgharbi, and Golijan counties were determined as the most suitable places for New Town development, whereas about 86.80% of highly suitable lands (141.73 Km2), 14.07% of moderately suitable lands (340.47 Km2), and 3.02% of marginally suitable lands (88.14 Km2) are located in these counties. The field study survey was conducted for the Miankaleh County, the results indicate that this county has a unique environmental quality with a rich fauna and flora. From socio-economic analysis, this county has an imbalanced urban- rural growth, whereas a negative growth rate for rural settlements was detected. Besides, low employment rate (22-37%) can be noted as another socio-economic challenge for this county. Although, several opportunities such as unique environmental quality, close distance to the Caspian Sea, and a good logistic access can be considered for creating New Town settlements.', 'Das New-Town-Planungskonzept wurde als alternative Lösung zur Regulierung des Stadt-Land-Wachstums in der iranischen Provinz Mazandaran übernommen.

Die Feldstudie wurde für den Bezirk Miankaleh durchgeführt. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass dieser Landkreis eine einzigartige Umweltqualität mit einer reichen Fauna und Flora aufweist. Aus der sozioökonomischen Analyse ergibt sich ein unausgeglichenes Stadt-Land-Wachstum, während eine negative Wachstumsrate für ländliche Siedlungen festgestellt wurde. Außerdem kann eine niedrige Beschäftigungsquote (22-37%) als eine weitere sozioökonomische Herausforderung für diesen Landkreis festgestellt werden.

"Synthesis of Carba- and Heterocycles based on novel One-Pot Cyclization of 1,1-Bis(trimethylsilyloxy)ketene Acetals and 1,3-Bis(Silyl Enol Ethers)","['1,1-Bis(trimethylsilyloxy)ketene acetals represent useful synthetic building blocks which can be regarded as masked carboxylic acid dianions. In recent years, a number of cyclization reactions of 1,1-bis(trimethylsilyloxy)ketene acetals have been reported. Functionalized maleic anhydrides represent important synthetic building blocks, which have been employed, for example, in the synthesis of ?-alkylidenebutenolides, maleimides, 5-alkylidene-5H-pyrrol-2-ones. Substituted maleic anhydrides are available by Michael reaction of nucleophiles with parent maleic anhydride and subsequent halogenation and elimination. Oxalyl chloride is an important synthetic tool for the synthesis of O-heterocycles. 3-hydroxymaleic (1-3) anhydrides were synthesised by one-pot cyclization of 1,1-bis(trimethylsilyloxy)ketene acetals with oxalyl chloride using TMSOTf as a catalyst. The Me3SiOTf mediated reaction of 1,1-bis(trimethylsilyloxy)ketene acetals with 3-silyloxyalk-2-en-1-ones, such as (4), afforded 5-ketoacids, such as (5). Treatment of the latter with TFA in CH2Cl2 afforded pyran-2-ones, such as (6-8). It has been found that 1,1-bis(trimethylsilyloxy)ketene acetals can behave as dinucleophile. Functionalized benzo-azoxabicyclo[3.3.1]nonanones (9-12), were prepared by regio- and diastereoselective condensation of 1,1-bis(silyloxy)ketene acetals with isoquinolinium and quinolinium salts and subsequent regioselective and stereospecific iodolactonization ...', 'Heterocyclische Verbindungen, Eintopfreaktion, Ketene, 1,1-Bis(trimethylsilyloxy)ketene Acetals, 1,3-Bis(Silyl Enol Ethers)']",gnd:4159726-6

"Protective Streptomyces in beewolves : ecology, evolutionary history and specificity of symbiont-mediated defense in Philanthini wasps (Hymenoptera, Crabronidae)","It is common for animals, plants and fungi to participate in a wide range of associations with microorganisms, and symbioses have been demonstrated to play a crucial role in the evolution of complexity and adaptation for various organisms. Being the most diverse animal class on earth, particularly insects are associated with an extraordinary variety of symbiotic microorganisms. In many insects the symbionts patronize the host´s metabolic potential by producing essential dietary supplements, thereby promoting the survival of their host. However, recent studies yielded evidence that symbiotic microorganisms can play an essential role for the protection of the insect host, its nutritional resources and it´s offspring against pathogenic bacteria and fungi. This thesis investigates the unique symbiotic association of beewolf wasps with antibiotic producing Streptomyces bacteria. Solitary digger wasps of the genera Philanthus, Philanthinus and Trachypus, engage in a unique and highly specific symbiosis with bacteria of the genus Streptomyces that provide protection to the wasp´s progeny. Female wasps cultivate the symbionts in specialized antennal gland reservoirs and secrete them into the subterranean brood cells as a white substance prior to oviposition. Subsequently, they are taken up by the beewolf larva and are incorporated into the silken walls of the cocoon. On the cocoon surface the symbiotic bacteria provide an antimicrobial defense against pathogen infestation by producing a cocktail of different antibiotic substances, thereby significantly enhancing the survival probability of the wasp offspring during their long and vulnerable phase of hibernation.",gnd:4002257-2 gnd:4148204-9 gnd:4157989-6 gnd:4136029-1 gnd:4183668-6

In addition, it describes physics-based methods for estimating the density of the astrophysical plasma surrounding AGN. All numerical computations of the photoionized gas employ the most advanced codes available (CLOUDY and TITAN). Calculations of the radiative transfer are based on the assumption of thermal and ionization equilibrium. Promising preliminary examples of comparison with current observations are included for several individual AGN. All of them suggest that the absorbing/emitting gas should have a density on the order of 1012 cm-3. Future observations will provide more objects to verify these results, and will allow us to put constraints on the launch radius of ionized outflows and therefore on the mass loading and kinetic energy outflow rates. These rates, in turn, are crucial to estimating whether the outflows have a significant feedback impact on star formation and metal enrichment in the interstellar medium of the host galaxy.

Rational Reasoning with Finite Conditional Knowledge Bases : Theoretical and Implementational Aspects,"['Nonmonotonic reasoning is a discipline of computer science, epistemology, and cognition: It models inferences where classical logic is inadequate in symbolic AI, defines normative models for reasoning with defeasible information in epistemology, and models human reasoning under information change in cognition.

"Linked markets : innovation, the dynamics of industries and general purpose technologies","This Doctoral Dissertation posits that markets, industries, and technologies displaying linked payoffs and connections upstream and downstream are subject to peculiar dynamics for what concerns economic and innovative activities compared to markets, industries and technologies considered in isolation. The main focus of the Dissertation is on a particular case of linked markets, the one affected by the presence of General Purpose Technologies (GPT). GPTs are technologies characterized by pervasiveness, continuous improvement, and inducement of innovational complementarities in linked industries. Those producing GPTs can be considered as upstream markets connected with a wide set of downstream applications; the linkage between GPTs and application sectors affects the incentives for technological innovation and diffusion as well as economic performance. Chapters Two, Three and Four of the Dissertation study the dynamics of industries and innovation in presence of GPTs. Chapters Five and Six of the Dissertation extend the analysis of linked markets beyond GPTs to topics such as market selection and policy intervention. For example, the violations of the replicator dynamics – that is, regressive developments of market selection – determined by the existence of value chain relations are identified and used to construct a more general theory of competition for the market. On the same vein, the constellation of public policy measures that limits or contrasts crowding-out in the context of commercialization of academic knowledge is highlighted and subject to experimental test. By studying the dynamics of linked markets and technologies when GPTs are involved, in value chains, and when policy can ease the commercialization of knowledge from the academic to the market domain, the dissertation opens room to develop a more complex and networked view of economic dynamics.",gnd:4027089-0 gnd:4026779-9 gnd:4346401-4
Development and evaluation of freeform surface descriptions,"In recent years, great efforts can be observed in the community of optical design to use the additional degrees of freedom afforded by freeform surfaces in optical systems. In particular one important question at the beginning of the concept and design of a freeform system is the decision how to mathematically describe the surface itself. If the development of an optical system with freeform surfaces is considered, not only the optical design, but also the mechanical design, the manufacturing and the assembly of the component inside the whole system are important. The focus in this PhD is on the design phase. Therefore only functions are considered which are globally defined on the computational area inside the boundary. The main approaches of describing freeform surfaces are discussed from a more mathematical point of view. More, two new polynomial sets the A-polynomials 1st and 2nd kind are introduced. The choice of description is often limited by the available options in the commercial software. Therefore a systematic study of the different options can still not be found. To overcome this problem the selected descriptions are evaluated in a comprehensive assessment. The results are collected in the form of a benchmark which compares different freeform surface descriptions for optical systems with one freeform for various applications with different types of symmetry, including refractive, reflective and catadioptric systems. The representations under the viewpoint of different initial systems, symmetry of the system, sensitivity in optimization and quality of the final result are compared and discussed. In particular the influence of the basic shape selection, the basic geometry to be Cartesian or polar and the importance of the orthogonality are investigated. Finally, in a conclusion the major results are summarized and a recommendation for practical work is formulated.",gnd:4042907-6 gnd:4338132-7 gnd:4126186-0 gnd:4198736-6 gnd:4148259-1
Developmental gene regulation by an ancient intercellular communication system in social amoebae,"Dictyostelids live as single cells for most of their life time, but under unfavourable conditions they can aggregate to form multicellular fruiting bodies. The aggregative chemoattractant glorin (N-propionyl-γ-L-glutamyl-L-ornithine-δ-lactam ethyl ester) was originally isolated from Polysphondylium violaceum. In this study, chemotaxis of amoebae to glorin is determined in species from all four major phylogenetic groups of Dictyostelids. Effects of glorin as a modulator of gene regulation in the early multicellular development are studied in the species Polysphondylium pallidum PN500. This study implies that glorin is the most ancient intercellular communication molecule that mediates not only chemotactic aggregation but also prepares amoebae to post-aggregative development by inducing genes required for intra- and intercellular signaling in the multicellular organism.",gnd:4136131-3 gnd:4532519-4

Fashion in the city and the city in fashion : urban representation in fashion magazines,"This dissertation concerns the changing role of fashion in the context of modern cities. In approaching this process, the research investigates the media discourse based on representations of fashion by cities and of cities by fashion. Moreover, this research focuses on fashion understood as a multidimensional phenomenon that aims to provide an explanation of urban spaces through fashion terms, actions, and garments. Additionally, cities are considered from the cultural geography approach that highlights the cultural component of urban spaces expressed in social and cultural practices in physical reality. Following this idea, it is suggested here that fashion today not only participates in the urban life as its significant component but also creates city images and representations of urban lifestyle through the fashion paradigm. In other words, fashion redefines urban spaces; at the same time, urban spaces are interpreted as a stage for fashion processes. By integrating in social research the fields of urban studies and fashion studies, this dissertation offers the discussion considering the fashion phenomenon not only as an urban phenomenon of modern reality. On the one hand, such discussion concerns the re-conceptualization of urban phenomena by the fashion influence; on the other hand, it relates the re-contextualization of fashion in a city. The empirical focus is based on the media context of fashion magazines in which variety of possibilities to represent fashion and cities lead to promising interpretations and analysis. The idea of representation specifies the ways of constructing the notion of urban space as fashionable space and the notion of fashion as placed in the urban context.",gnd:4039792-0 gnd:4056723-0

Performance of current models of speech recognition and resulting challenges,"['Speech is usually perceived in background noise (masker) that can severely hamper its recognition. Nevertheless, there are mechanisms that enable speech recognition even in difficult listening conditions.

Moreover, masking aspects such as energetic, amplitude modulation or informational masking are considered. Speech recognition in complex maskers is investigated that systematically vary in their spectro-temporal properties and address all aspects listed above. Outcomes of current models of speech recognition are compared to the data observed in the listening experiments. This allows to assess how well the different models account for the observed speech reception thresholds, as each model incorporates different signal analysis strategies.

Robust automatic speech recognition and modeling of auditory discrimination experiments with auditory spectro-temporal features,"Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems still do not perform as well as human listeners under realistic conditions. The unmatched ability of humans to understand speech in most difficult acoustic conditions originates from the superior properties of their auditory system. The aim of this thesis is to improve the recognition performance of ASR systems in difficult acoustic conditions by carefully integrating auditory signal processing strategies. To this end, the physiologically inspired extraction of spectro-temporal modulation patterns was successfully integrated into the front-end of a standard ASR system. Further, the joint spectro-temporal processing could be separated into independent temporal and spectral processes. To investigate the reason for the remaining ""man-machine-gap"" in recognition performance, a range of critical auditory discrimination tasks were performed using ASR systems. The comparison with empirical data showed that the separate spectro-temporal modulation front-end provides a suitable auditory model and revealed the importance of across-frequency processing in speech recognition. <engl.>",gnd:4056494-0 gnd:4116579-2 gnd:4003961-4

High-frequency light-matter interaction in atoms and molecules,"The field of attosecond science is a novel and fast-evolving research area that aims at unravelling the motion of particles in atoms, molecules, and solids. Therein, attochemistry thrives to understand, monitor, and one-day control the movement of electrons in molecules, which will open a new path to steer nuclear dynamics and photochemical reactions. In order to observe the motion of electrons, attosecond resolution and, thus, attosecond light pulses are needed. These attosecond pulses are inherently rooted in the high-frequency regime, ranging from XUV to soft and hard x-ray radiation. Depending on the energy, intensity, and aimed-at observable, different light-matter interactions can be studied. In this work, we tackle three different kinds of high-frequency light-matter interaction that originate in three different energy regimes and allow us to gain novel insight into the dynamics of molecules. In the XUV regime, the ionisation dynamics of correlated, multi-particle systems is studied together with few-cycle effects. In the soft x-ray regime, attosecond x-ray absorption is introduced as a novel tool to observe coupled electron and nuclear dynamics in a neutral molecule. In the hard x-ray regime, we focus on ultrafast, non-resonant x-ray scattering, which can be transformed into a future technology capable of observing electron dynamics. We are confident that this work will benefit the general understanding of high-frequency light-matter interaction in atoms and molecules, as well as aid and initiate new experiments in the field of attochemistry using XUV ionisation, x-ray absorption, and x-ray scattering.",gnd:4842731-7 gnd:4047979-1 gnd:4045959-7 gnd:4185098-1 gnd:4039979-5 gnd:4003423-9

Timing for outcrossing : circadian clock regulates floral rhythms with large fitness consequences,"Like most organisms, plants need to keep a daily rhythm to synchronize their inner functions to the available energy and nutrients; even due to its sessile nature it’s especially important for a large group to find ways to reproduce by outcrossing. The endogenous clock regulates metabolic processes related to the synchronization of plant traits that allows its survival and successful reproduction in pollinator dependent plants. In this work, the circadian clock genes in Nicotiana attenuata were identified and found to have a conserved function, as demonstrated by yeast two-hybrid assays and a similar hypocotyl length phenotypes on transformed Arabidopsis thaliana plants using N. attenuata transferred genes. Under long day conditions (LD) NaLHY and NaTOC1 peak at dawn and dusk, respectively, without NaZTL having marked oscillations like other plant models. The silencing of circadian genes in N. attenuata using inverted repeat (ir) technique showed similar clock transcription profile alterations of NaCAB2 and hypocotyl growth alteration as in the established clock model. Yet, irTOC1 plants had a delayed elongation and flowering under LD unlike some other model plant accessions, but it is attributable to a different habitat and genetic background, as seen in cross latitudinal studies of other species. Floral traits under circadian control are relevant to synchronize the display and scent emission of N. attenuata with its night-pollinator Manduca sexta. Flower vertical movement temporally excludes other pollinators by reduced conspicuousness. The right synchronization improves outcrossing by M. sexta in the field since dysrhythmic floral traits decreased pollination rate. However, a lack of regulation caused basically arrhythmic floral traits since irZTL had unexpected advantages during day-time outcrossing in the field due to the recruitment of day-active pollinators that provided similar reproductive results as night-pollinator dependent plants.",gnd:4128987-0 gnd:4626532-6 gnd:4078131-8 gnd:4007210-1
Emerging model species driven by transcriptomics,"This work is focused on 'emerging model species', i.e. question-driven model species which have sufficient molecular resources to investigate a specific phenomenon in molecular biology, developmental biology, molecular ecology and evolution or related molecular fields. This thesis shows how transcriptomic data can be generated, analyzed, and used to investigate such phenomena of interest even in species lacking a reference genome. The initial ButterflyBase resource has proven to be useful to researchers of species without a reference genome but is limited to the Lepidoptera and supports only the older Sanger sequencing technologies. Thanks to Next Generation Sequencing, transcriptome sequencing is more cost effective but the bottleneck of transcriptomic projects is now the bioinformatic analysis and data mining/dissemination. Therefore, this work continues with presenting novel and innovative approaches which effectively overcome this bottleneck. The est2assembly software produces deeply annotated reference transcriptomes stored in the Chado database.

Robust speech recognition based on spectro-temporal processing,"['In this thesis, novelle spectro-temporal feature extraction techniques are evaluated for enhancing the robustness of automatic speech recognition systems (ASR) in adverse acoustical conditions. Recent physiological and psychoacoustical findings indicate that spectro-temporal processing plays an important role in human speech perception. Therefore, sigma-pi cells and Gabor filter functions are investigated as secondary feature extraction methods based on a spectro-temporal representation. Especially the Gabor features are versatile enough to include cepstral features and purely temporal filtering as special cases, while additionally aiming at combined spectro-temporal modulations. A data driven feature selection method is applied for feature set optimization. For small vocabularies, both types of features are shown to increase the robustness of ASR systems. Sigma-pi cells also allow for estimating the speech-to-noise ratio of an input signal solely based on low spectro-temporal modulation. The Gabor based Tandem feature sets increase the performance of the Qualcomm-ICSI-OGI system for the Aurora task, when concatenating the two streams. <engl.>', 'In dieser Dissertation werden neuartige spektro-temporale Merkmale untersucht, die einer Verbesserung der Robustheit automatischer Spracherkennungssysteme unter ungünstigen akustischen Bedingungen dienen sollen.

Methods for the reconstruction of large scale anisotropies of the cosmic ray flux,"In cosmic ray experiments the arrival directions, among other properties, of cosmic ray particles from detected air shower events are reconstructed. The question of uniformity in the distribution of arrival directions is of large importance for models that try to explain cosmic radiation. In this thesis, methods for the reconstruction of parameters of a dipole-like flux distribution of cosmic rays from a set of recorded air shower events are studied. Different methods are presented and examined by means of detailed Monte Carlo simulations. Particular focus is put on the implications of spurious experimental effects. Modifications of existing methods and new methods are proposed. The main goal of this thesis is the development of the horizontal Rayleigh analysis method. Unlike other methods, this method is based on the analysis of local viewing directions instead of global sidereal directions. As a result, the symmetries of the experimental setup can be better utilised. The calculation of the sky coverage (exposure function) is not necessary in this analysis. The performance of the method is tested by means of further Monte Carlo simulations. The new method performs similarly good or only marginally worse than established methods in case of ideal measurement conditions. However, the simulation of certain experimental effects can cause substantial misestimations of the dipole parameters by the established methods, whereas the new method produces no systematic deviations. The invulnerability to certain effects offers additional advantages, as certain data selection cuts become dispensable.",gnd:4708913-1 gnd:4240945-7 gnd:4165371-3 gnd:4002073-3
An investigation of complex deformation patterns detected by using InSAR at Llaima and Tendürek volcanoes,"Surface displacement at volcanic edifices is related to subsurface processes associated with magma movements, fluid transfers within the volcano edifice and gravity-driven deformation processes. Understanding of associated ground displacements is of importance for assessment of volcanic hazards. For example, volcanic unrest is often preceded by surface uplift, caused by magma intrusion and followed by subsidence, after the withdrawal of magma. Continuous monitoring of the surface displacement at volcanoes therefore might allow the forecasting of upcoming eruptions to some extent. In geophysics, the measured surface displacements allow the parameters of possible deformation sources to be estimated through analytical or numerical modeling. This is one way to improve the understanding of subsurface processes acting at volcanoes. Although the monitoring of volcanoes has significantly improved in the last decades (in terms of technical advancements and number of monitored volcanoes), the forecasting of volcanic eruptions remains puzzling. In this work I contribute towards the understanding of the subsurface processes at volcanoes and thus to the improvement of volcano eruption forecasting. I have investigated the displacement field of Llaima volcano in Chile and of Tendürek volcano in East Turkey by using synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR). Through modeling of the deformation sources with the extracted displacement data, it was possible to gain insights into potential subsurface processes occurring at these two volcanoes that had been barely studied before. The two volcanoes, although of very different origin, composition and geometry, both show a complexity of interacting deformation sources. At Llaima volcano, the InSAR technique was difficult to apply, due to the large decorrelation of the radar signal between the acquisition of images. I developed a model-based unwrapping scheme, which allows the production of reliable displacement maps at the volcano that I used for deformation source modeling. The modeling results show significant differences in pre- and post-eruptive magmatic deformation source parameters. Therefore, I conjecture that two magma chambers exist below Llaima volcano: a post-eruptive deep one and a shallow one possibly due to the pre-eruptive ascent of magma. Similar reservoir depths at Llaima have been confirmed by independent petrologic studies. These reservoirs are interpreted to be temporally coupled. At Tendürek volcano I have found long-term subsidence of the volcanic edifice, which can be described by a large, magmatic, sill-like source that is subject to cooling contraction. The displacement data in conjunction with high-resolution optical images, however, reveal arcuate fractures at the eastern and western flank of the volcano. These are most likely the surface expressions of concentric ring-faults around the volcanic edifice that show low magnitudes of slip over a long time. This might be an alternative mechanism for the development of large caldera structures, which are so far assumed to be generated during large catastrophic collapse events. To investigate the potential subsurface geometry and relation of the two proposed interacting sources at Tendürek, a sill-like magmatic source and ring-faults, I have performed a more sophisticated numerical modeling approach. The optimum source geometries show, that the size of the sill-like source was overestimated in the simple models and that it is difficult to determine the dip angle of the ring-faults with surface displacement data only. However, considering physical and geological criteria a combination of outward-dipping reverse faults in the west and inward-dipping normal faults in the east seem to be the most likely. Consequently, the underground structure at the Tendürek volcano consists of a small, sill-like, contracting, magmatic source below the western summit crater that causes a trapdoor-like faulting along the ring-faults around the volcanic edifice. Therefore, the magmatic source and the ring-faults are also interpreted to be temporally coupled. In addition, a method for data reduction has been improved. The modeling of subsurface deformation sources requires only a relatively small number of well distributed InSAR observations at the earth’s surface. Satellite radar images, however, consist of several millions of these observations. Therefore, the large amount of data needs to be reduced by several orders of magnitude for source modeling, to save computation time and increase model flexibility. I have introduced a model-based subsampling approach in particular for heterogeneously-distributed observations. It allows a fast calculation of the data error variance-covariance matrix, also supports the modeling of time dependent displacement data and is, therefore, an alternative to existing method",gnd:4136115-5 gnd:4027296-5 gnd:4195782-9 gnd:4315323-9 gnd:4128339-9 gnd:4113458-8
Single artificial atom lasing of a dressed flux qubit,"Superconducting quantum bits originally developed for quantum computation have properties similar to real atoms. Because they are micro fabricated circuits, their interaction with electromagnetic radiation can be engineered and effects known from quantum optics may be realized. In this work, a unique lasing scheme exploiting only the lowest two levels of a single artificial atom coupled to a high-quality superconducting resonator is experimentally realized.  It is based on the dressing of the atom’s states by a strong signal and the associated rescaling of the relaxation. In addition, basic physical processes are discussed by a separate characterization of the artificial atom, the resonator, and their coupling.  A quantum theory including dissipative processes is developed from basic superconducting effects and its applicability demonstrated by a perfect agreement with the experimental results.

The evolvement of standards in China : insights from the electric vehicle sector,"['This book analyses why Chinese technology standards deviate from international standards. The research it contains is based on four periods of field research in Beijing that involved 70 expert interviews. The data gathered throughout these interviews resulted in a detailed case study on the Chinese standardisation system and particularly the electric vehicle sector. The book’s application of complexity theory shows that the evolvement of deviating standards is a substantial component in the development of the Chinese standardisation system. This is further explained by its use of a ‘Three Phase Standardisation Development Concept’. This book fills a gap in existing research, especially because it focuses on a developing country with a standardisation system that is in transition.Sabrina Weithmann focuses her research on green technology and conducts research on the impact of related business models on standardisation and regulation in the energy sector.', 'Das Buch analysiert, weshalb chinesische Technologienormen von internationalen Normen abweichen.

Computational mass spectrometry of linear binary synthetic copolymers,"The accurate characterization of synthetic polymer sequences represents a major challenge in polymer science. We present a computational approach to quantify the abundances of all sequences in a measured copolymer sample. The first step in our workflow is transforming mass spectra into copolymer fingerprints. Our method is based on linear programming and is capable of automatically resolving overlapping isotopes and isobaric ions. Peak intensities in matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization spectra are influenced by mass and composition-dependent ionization. We demonstrate a method to correct the abundance bias. The second step in our workflow is interpreting the computed copolymer fingerprints using new Markov chain models for copolymerization kinetics: The Bernoulli and Geometric models. In contrast to previous Markov chain approaches to copolymerization, both models take variable chain lengths and time-dependent monomer probabilities into account and allow computing sequence likelihoods and copolymer fingerprints. We find that computing the models is fast and memory efficient. Then, we focus on the Geometric copolymerization model with reactivity parameters. First, several approaches to identify the optimal model parameters from observed fingerprints are evaluated using Monte-Carlo simulated data. A compromise between robustness and running time is found by exploiting the relationship between ordinary differential equations and the Geometric model. Second, we show that the model is also useful for copolymerizations involving termination and depropagation reactions. We then compute several copolymer statistics and compared them to the statistics obtained from Monte-Carlo simulations. Last but not least, we present our software framework COCONUT, which implements all algorithms presented in this thesis. Our software is freely available and provides a graphical user interface.

Trait-based understanding of plant species distributions along environmental gradients,"For more than two centuries, plant ecologists have aimed to understand how environmental gradients and biotic interactions shape the distribution and co-occurrence of plant species. In recent years, functional trait–based approaches have been increasingly used to predict patterns of species co-occurrence and species distributions along environmental gradients (trait–environment relationships). Functional traits are measurable properties at the individual level that correlate well with important processes. Thus, they allow us to identify general patterns by synthesizing studies across specific taxonomic compositions, thereby fostering our understanding of the underlying processes of species assembly. However, the importance of specific processes have been shown to be highly dependent on the spatial scale under consideration. In particular, it remains uncertain which mechanisms drive species assembly and allow for plant species coexistence at smaller, more local spatial scales. [...]",gnd:4601495-0
An integrative approach to linguistic complexity analysis for German,"['This thesis develops an integrative approach to automatic linguistic complexity analyses for German and applies it to predict the proficiency of learner writing and the readability of texts for native and non-native speakers of German. Complexity is a central concept in applied linguistics and has been used in Second Language Acquisition (SLA) research to characterize and benchmark language proficiency and to track developmental trajectories of learners (Ortega, 2012). However, the focus of SLA complexity research has been on the analysis of syntax and lexicon and the English language (Housen et al., 2019; Wolfe-Quintero et al., 1998). More research on other linguistic domains—such as morphology or discourse—is needed to model complexity as a multidimensional construct. Furthermore, more languages should be studied to promote complexity research. Measures of linguistic complexity have also been found to be important features in computational linguistic research on Automatic Proficiency Assessment (APA) and Automatic Readability Assessment (ARA). This thesis combines insights from SLA complexity research and computational linguistic approaches to APA and ARA to address important research gaps in SLA complexity research and work on APA and ARA for education contexts. We propose a linguistically broad approach to complexity that combines measures of syntactic, lexical, and morphological complexity, as well as measures of discourse, human processing, and language use. In doing so, we integrate theories and concepts form different research disciplines including SLA complexity research, computational linguistics, and psychology. We implemented a system to automatically calculate these measures relying on Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. With 543 measures, it calculates to the best of our knowledge the largest and most diverse collection of measures of absolute and relative complexity for German. To make this resource accessible to other researchers and thereby promote the comparability and reproducibility of complexity research for German, we integrated this system into the Common Text Analysis Platform (CTAP) by Chen and Meurers (2016). We generalized the originally monolingual web platform for English to support multilingual analyses, leading to its extension to several additional languages. In an empirical study on the impact of non-standard language on the NLP annotations and subsequent calculation of measures, we confirmed that even on language from beginning learners, our analysis remains overall robust and errors hardly impact our complexity estimates or models trained with them. We then demonstrate the value of our integrative broad linguistic modeling approach to linguistic complexity for APA and ARA. First, we provide an overview of the current research landscape for both domains by conducting two systematic surveys focusing on automatic approaches for German published in the past twenty years. Both surveys showcase the need for more research on approaches targeting second or foreign language (L2) learners and young native speakers, more cross-corpus testing, and more accessible models. For ARA, we observed that traditional readability formulas remain the de facto standard in research that is not specifically dedicated to the development of new ARA approaches, even though they have been criticized as overly simplistic by ARA researchers and generally perform below the current state-of-the-art (SOTA). Second, we report on several machine learning experiments that build on these insights and take into consideration the research needs we identified. We train models for predicting language proficiency for L2 learners on long texts at the full Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) scale (A1 to C1/C2) and short answers to reading comprehension questions in the form of course levels (ranging from A1.1 to A2.2). We also train a model for capturing early native language (L1) academic language proficiency of students using grade levels (1st to 8th grade). For text readability, we train models for L2 learners for longer texts (distinguishing texts for learners at the CEFR levels A2, B1/B2, C1) and sentences (using a 7-point Likert scale) as well as a model for German media language aimed at children or adults (making a binary distinction). We test these models across corpora and on hold-out data sets. With this, we illustrate the generalizability of our models across different task contexts, elicitation contexts, languages, and publishers. We also perform linguistic analyses on all data sets studied, which yields important insights into the characterization of developmental trajectories in German. This thesis makes a special methodological contribution to ARA, as we compile a total of three new readability corpora which for the first time facilitate cross-corpus testing and cross-language testing for German ARA. In sum, this thesis provides novel insights into the developmental variation of linguistic complexity in German and its role for text readability. It also contributes important new resources for research on complexity, ARA, and APA by making available the multilingual CTAP system, new readability corpora, and new models for German.', 'Diese Dissertation entwickelt einen integrativen Ansatz zur automatischen Analyse linguistischer Komplexität für das Deutsche und wendet ihn an, um die Schreibkompetenz von Lernenden und die Lesbarkeit von Texten für deutsche Muttersprachler:innen und Nicht-Muttersprachler:innen vorherzusagen. Komplexität ist ein zentrales Konzept in der angewandten Linguistik und wurde in der Forschung zum Zweitspracherwerb (SLA) verwendet, um die Sprachkompetenz von Lernenden zu charakterisieren und zu messen (Ortega, 2012). Der Schwerpunkt der SLA-Komplexitätsforschung lag hierbei auf der Analyse von Syntax und Lexikon im Englischen (Housen et al., 2019; Wolfe-Quintero et al., 1998). Um Komplexität als multidimensionales Konstrukt zu modellieren, sind weitere Forschungen zu anderen sprachlichen Bereichen erforderlich (beispielsweise Morphologie oder Diskurs). Zudem müssen mehr unterschiedliche Sprachen untersucht werden, um die Komplexitätsforschung voranzubringen. Maße für sprachliche Komplexität haben sich auch in der computerlinguistischen Forschung zur automatischen Sprachkompetenzbewertung (APA) und zur automatischen Lesbarkeitserfassung (ARA) als wichtige Merkmale erwiesen. In dieser Arbeit werden Erkenntnisse aus der SLA-Komplexitätsforschung und computergestützte linguistische Ansätze für APA und ARA kombiniert, um wichtige Forschungslücken in den jeweiligen Disziplinen zu schließen. Wir schlagen einen linguistisch breit angelegten Ansatz für Komplexität vor, der Maße für syntaktische, lexikalische und morphologische Komplexität sowie Maße für Diskurs, menschliche Sprachverarbeitung und Sprachgebrauch kombiniert. Dabei integrieren wir Theorien und Konzepte aus verschiedenen Forschungsdisziplinen wie der SLA-Komplexitätsforschung, der Computerlinguistik und der Psychologie. Wir haben ein System zur automatischen Berechnung dieser Maße implementiert, das auf Techniken der natürlichen Sprachverarbeitung (NLP) beruht. Mit 543 Maßen berechnet es nach unserem derzeitigen Kenntnisstand die größte und vielfältigste Sammlung von Maßen der absoluten und relativen Komplexität für das Deutsche. Um diese Ressource anderen Forschern zugänglich zu machen und damit die Vergleichbarkeit und Reproduzierbarkeit der Komplexitätsforschung für das Deutsche zu fördern, haben wir dieses System in CTAP (Chen und Meurers, 2016) integriert. Wir haben die ursprünglich nur für Englisch entwickelte Webplattform generalisiert, um mehrsprachige Analysen zu unterstützen. Dies führte bereits zu ihrer Erweiterung auf mehrere andere Sprachen. In einer empirischen Studie zu den Auswirkungen von nicht-standardisierter Sprache auf die NLP Annotationen und die anschließende Berechnung der Maße haben wir bestätigen können, dass unsere Analyse selbst bei Sprache von Deutsch-Anfängern insgesamt robust bleibt und etwaige Fehler nur geringe Auswirkungen auf unsere Komplexitätsmessungen oder die damit trainierten Modelle haben. Im Weiteren demonstrieren wir den Wert unseres integrativen, breit angelegten linguistischen Modellierungsansatzes für linguistische Komplexität für APA und ARA. Zunächst geben wir einen Überblick über die aktuelle Forschungslandschaft für beide Bereiche, indem wir zwei systematische Literaturrecherchen zu automatischen Ansätzen für das Deutsche in den vergangenen zwanzig Jahren durchführen. Beide Erhebungen zeigen den Bedarf an mehr Forschung zu Ansätzen, die sich an Zweit- oder Fremdsprachenlerner und junge Muttersprachler richten, an mehr korpusübergreifenden Tests und an besser zugänglichen Modellen. In Bezug auf ARA stellen wir fest, dass traditionelle Lesbarkeitsformeln weiterhin den Standard in der Forschung darstellen, die sich nicht speziell mit der Entwicklung neuer ARA-Ansätze befasst. Dies ist der Fall, obwohl diese Formeln von ARA-Forschern als zu vereinfachend kritisiert wurden und im Allgemeinen schlechtere Ergebnisse als zeitgenössische Verfahren liefern. Zweitens berichten wir über mehrere Experimente zum maschinellen Lernen, die die von uns so ermittelten Forschungslücken adressieren. Wir trainieren Modelle zur Vorhersage der Sprachkompetenz von L2-Lernern für lange Texte auf der gesamten Skala des Gemeinsamen Europäischen Referenzrahmens für Sprachen (GER; A1 bis C1/C2) und kurze Antworten auf Fragen zum Leseverständnis in Form von Kursstufen (von A1.1 bis A2.2). Außerdem trainieren wir ein Modell zur Erfassung der frühen muttersprachlichen akademischen Sprachkenntnisse von Schülern anhand von Klassenstufen (1. bis 8. Klasse). Für die Lesbarkeit von Texten trainieren wir Modelle für L2-Lerner für längere Texte (mit Unterscheidung von Texten für Lerner auf den GER-Niveaustufen A2, B1/B2, C1) und Sätze (unter Verwendung einer 7-Punkte-Likert-Skala) sowie ein Modell für deutsche Mediensprache, das sich an Kinder oder Erwachsene richtet (mit einer binären Unterscheidung). Wir testen diese Modelle über Korpora hinweg und an Hold-out-Datensätzen. Damit illustrieren wir die Generalisierbarkeit unserer Modelle über verschiedene Aufgabenkontexte, Erhebungskontexte, Sprachen und Verlage hinweg. Darüber hinaus führen wir für alle untersuchten Datensätze linguistische Analysen durch, die wichtige Erkenntnisse über die Charakterisierung von Entwicklungsverläufen im Deutschen liefern. Wir leisten dabei einen besonderen methodischen Beitrag zu ARA, indem wir drei neue Lesbarkeitskorpora erstellen, die erstmals die korpus- und sprachenübergreifende Evaluation von ARA-Modellen für das Deutsche ermöglichen.

Characterisation and engineering of plastic-degrading enzymes,"['Biokatalyse, Proteindesign, High throughput screening, Biosensor, High-throughput assay, PET, PET Hydrolases, Protein Engineering', 'This thesis deals with the characterisation and engineering of new thermophilic PET hydrolases as potential candidates for an eco-friendly biocatalytic recycling approach for the upcycling or downcycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) on industrial scale. Furthermore, high-throughput screening methods are described that detect the products of PET hydrolysis. The high demand of PET in the packaging and textile industries with a global production of 82 million metric tons per year has significantly contributed to the global solid waste stream and environmental plastic pollution after its end-of-life. Although PET hydrolases have been identified in various microorganisms, only a handful of benchmark enzymes have been engineered for industrial applications. Therefore, the identification of new PET hydrolases from metagenomes or via protein engineering approaches, especially thermophilic PET hydrolases with optimal operating temperatures (i.e., increased thermostability and activity) near the glass transition temperature of the polymer PET, is a crucial step towards a bio-based circular plastic economy. Article I demonstrates that metagenome-derived thermophilic PET hydrolases can be significantly improved using different engineering approaches to achieve a similar activity level as the well-established leaf-branch-compost cutinase (LCC) F243I/D238C/S283C/Y127G variant (LCC ICCG).

Parsimonious histograms,"['The dissertation is concerned with the construction of data driven histograms. Histograms are the most elementary density estimators at all. However, they require the specification of the number and width of the bins. This thesis provides two new construction methods delivering adaptive histograms where the required parameters are determined automatically. Both methods follow the principle of parsimony, i.e. the histograms are solutions of predetermined optimization problems. In both cases, but under different aspects, the number of bins is minimized. The dissertation presents the algorithms that solve the optimization problems and illustrates them by a number of numerical experiments. Important properties of the estimators are shown. Finally, the new developed methods are compared with standard methods by an extensive simulation study. By means of synthetic samples of different size and distribution the histograms are evaluated by special performance criteria. As one main result, the proposed methods yield histograms with considerably fewer bins and with an excellent ability of peak detection.', 'Statistik, Dichteschätzung, Histogramm, mathematische Statistik, nichtparametrische Dichteschätzung, Histogramme, Histogramm-Konstruktion, sparsame Darstellung von Daten, mathematical statistics, nonparametric density estimation, histograms, histogram construction, sparse representation of data']",gnd:4159984-6

For microbiology, light microscopy even played a founding role in the conception of the entire discipline. The ability to observe pathogens that would otherwise evade human observation makes it a critical necessity and an indispensable tool to infectious disease research. Thus, the aim of this thesis was to optimize, extend, and functionally apply advanced light microscopy techniques to elucidate spatio-temporal and spatio-morphological components of bacterial and viral infection in vitro and in vivo. Pathogens are in a constant arms race with the host’s immune system. By finding ways to circumvent host-mediated immune responses, they try to evade elimination and facilitate their own propagation. The first study (publication I) demonstrated that the obligate intracellular pathogen Coxiella burnetii is not just able to infect natural killer (NK) cells, but is actually capable of surviving the harsh degradative conditions in the cytotoxic lymphocyte’s granules. Using live-cell imaging of reporter-expressing Coxiella burnetii, the transient NK cell passage was closely monitored to provide detailed spatio-temporal information on this dynamic process in support of a range of static analyses. Bacterial release from NK cells was pinpointed to a time frame between 24 to 48 hours post-infection and the duration of release to about 15 minutes.

Persistente Photoleitfähigkeit in dünnen GaN- und AlGaN-Schichten,"['Galliumnitrid (GaN) will be the dominating material system for optoelectronic device in the short wavelength range (blue to ultraviolet), e.g. light emitting diodes and laser diodes. In this work I will investigate the persistent photoconductivity (PPC) in GaN. This effect is visible in GaN under illumination with subbandgap-light. The electrical conductivity increases under illumination and remains after the end of the light excitation for extreme long times. The optical excitation with subbandgap-light and the long time constants are in all probability related to deep metastable defects in the bandgap of GaN. In the present work I will try to identify the responsible defect. Especially oxygen will be discussed as the relevant impurity. The mechanism of the metastability is due to microscopic potential fluctuations. The spatial localization of the defect shows a great importance of the interfacial layer in the explanation of the PPC in terms of potential fluctuations. This layer is a defect rich and strained region in the samples, mainly due to imperfect crystalline growth. In a comparison of the samples I will show how to reduce or even prevent the PPC. <engl.>', 'Galliumnitrid (GaN) wird in den nächsten Jahren im Bereich optoelektronischer Anwendungen das dominierende Materialsystem für Bauteile wie Leuchtdioden und Halbleiterlaserdioden im kurzwelligen Bereich (blau bis ultraviolett) sein.

Process-based modelling of the methane balance in periglacial landscapes,"A detailed process-based methane module for the global land surface scheme JSBACH has been developed that is general enough to be applied in permafrost regions as well as wetlands outside permafrost areas. Methane production, oxidation and transport by ebullition, diffusion and plants are represented. Oxygen has been explicitly incorporated into diffusion, transport by plants, bulk soil oxidation and rhizospheric oxidation. Permafrost and wetland soils show special behaviour, e.g. variable soil pore space due to freezing/thawing or water table depths due to changing soil water content. This was integrated directly into the methane-related processes. A detailed application at the Samoylov polygonal tundra site, Lena River Delta, was used for evaluation purposes, which shows differences in the importance of the several processes and in the methane dynamics under varying soil moisture, ice and temperature conditions during different seasons and on the two different microsites, the elevated moist polygonal rim and the depressed wet polygonal centre. The evaluation shows sufficiently good agreement with field observations despite the module was not specifically calibrated to these data. In a second step, an enhanced version of JSBACH, including an updated methane module, was used for regional future climate experiments. The changes concern hydrology, carbon decomposition, methane production, order of the transport processes and plant transport. A new transport process was included, the diffusion through snow. The updated model was applied at the larger area of the Lena River Delta. Detailed analyses of soil respiration and methane process fluxes, their spatial distribution as well as changes with time and in the seasonal behaviour are presented. They show the relevance of methane compared to the carbon dioxide fluxes, the pattern of regions with favourable conditions for methane emissions as well as the increase of fluxes and emission season length due to climate change.",gnd:4286529-3 gnd:4129794-5

Locally Decodable Codes and Private Information Retrieval Schemes,"Locally decodable codes (LDCs) are codes that simultaneously provide efficient random access retrieval and high noise resilience by allowing reliable reconstruction of an arbitrary bit of a message by looking at only a small number of randomly chosen codeword bits. Local decodability comes with a certain loss in terms of efficiency - specifically, locally decodable codes require longer codeword lengths than their classical counterparts. Private information retrieval (PIR) schemes are cryptographic protocols designed to safeguard the privacy of database users. They allow clients to retrieve records from public databases while completely hiding the identity of the retrieved records from database owners. In this book the author provides a fresh algebraic look at the theory of locally decodable codes and private information retrieval schemes, obtaining new families of each which have much better parameters than those of previously known constructions, and he also proves limitations of two server PIRs in a restricted setting that covers all currently known schemes.

Probing and fixturing techniques for wideband multiport measurements in digital packaging,"['This thesis deals with test signal probing and fixturing techniques for wideband multiport measurements in digital packaging in the frequency range from a few MHz to 50 GHz.

In the next step the recessed probe launch technique is briefly presented. After that the main focus is on the results obtained in recent investigations with respect to the launch calibration, application to measurements of embedded multilayer structures and modifications to improve the launch bandwidth. Finally, the concept of a novel multiport probing fixture is presented and its electrical performance explored. Using a simple two-tier calibration procedure, the effect of the probing fixture on measurements of dense via array structures is reduced and the results obtained are validated with microprobe based measurements.

Synthesis and applications of biscyclopropenium phosphines as ancillary ligands in catalysis,"The aim of this thesis was the design of new strong π‐acceptor ligands. In our approach two cyclopropenium substituents were attached to the phosphorus atom of the phosphine in order to introduce enhanced π-acceptor character. These biscyclopropenium phosphines, unlike their polyhalogenated analogues (PF3, P(CF3)3 and PCl3), were air stable. While the variation of the third (non-cationic) substituent attached to the phosphorus of the dicationic phosphine allowed further modification of its electronic properties, the decoration of one cyclopropenium unit with longer aliphatic chains facilitated the solution of the charged species in non-polar solvents like toluene. Furthermore, the BF4- counter-ion of some of the prepared phosphines was exchanged for SbF6- in order to investigate its influence on the reactivity in catalysis later on. Subsequent coordination of these dicationic phosphines to various transition metals afforded the corresponding Au(I), Pt(II), Ir(I) and Ag(I) complexes. The reactivity of the prepared dicationic Au(I)-precatalysts was investigated in the 6-endo-dig cycolisomerization of biphenyl-alkynes with two substituents in internal positions to their corresponding phenanthrene derivatives. After successful optimization, this methodology was applied in the synthesis Calanquinone C. Finally, the substrate scope of the utilized Au(I)-precatalysts was expanded from the synthesis of phenanthrene derivatives to the preparation of naphto-furans. ; Das Ziel dieser Arbeit war es neue starke π-Akkzeptor Liganden herzustellen. In unserer Herangehensweise wurden zwei Cyclopropenium-Substituenten an das Phosphoratom des hergestellten Phosphins gebunden, um einen verstärkten π-Akkzeptor Charakter einzuführen. Diese synthetisierten Biscyclopropeniumphosphine waren luftstabil im Gegensatz zu ihren polyhalogenierten Analogen (PF3, P(CF3)3 und PCl3). Die Variation des dritten (nicht-kationischen) Substituenten, der an das Phosphoratom des dikationischen Phosphins gebunden ist, erlaubt die Modifikation der elektronischen Eigenschaften der jeweiligen Verbindung. Die Anbringung längerer aliphatischer Ketten an die Cyclopropeniumeinheit ermöglicht die vollständige Lösung des dikationischen Phosphins in nicht-polaren Lösungsmitteln wie Toluol.

Tuning spin-dependent transport properties of atomic-scale junctions : an ab initio Study,"['In the current work the theoretical investigations of transport properties of nano-sized magnetic contacts are presented and the new methods to obtain and control high spin-polarized current and magnetoresistance are proposed. The studies were performed by means of ab-initio methods based on the density functional theory (SIESTA,SMEAGOL) and the non-equilibrium Green’s functions formalism (SMEAGOL). Investigated Au atomic chain suspended between Co electrodes revealed a high magnetoresistance ratio and a spin polarization of a conductance caused by interfacial hybridization between Au and Co. This effect is found to be stable against geometry deformations. Spin-polarized conductance and current in the plane GdN nano contacts placed between Cu electrodes were studied. It was found that the system has ideal spin-filtering properties caused by a half-metallic nature of the GdN. The possibility to control a current spin polarization by a gate electrode was demonstrated in the investigations of Fe-Pt, Fe-Pd and Fe-Rh nanocontacts between Pt, Pd and Rh electrodes respectively.

"Mathematical modeling, simulation and analysis of metabolic oscillations in Bacillus subtilis biofilms","Metabolic oscillations in biofilms of Bacillus subtilis have been reported as periodic halting of growth in the expansion of the colony growing in a microfluidics chamber by Liu et al (2015). This thesis is aimed at understanding these oscillations through minimal dynamic model involving three ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The model is first applied in its basic form in order to describe the oscillations. Next, various modifications of the model are discussed in detail and the results of each modification are viewed in light of the underlying biology. The four modifications investigate the mechanism of oscillations with respect to spatial effects, reversible reactions and more robust reaction kinetics. Finally, we apply the minimal model in a broader perspective in order to understand population dynamics in a typical community of a social organism. We consider three interacting subpopulations of a species that have their own distinct phenotypes. None of the subpopulations have an absolute advantage over the other two. This gives rise to cyclic dynamics like the rock paper scissors game which is analysed using evolutionary game theory. We also present an asymmetrical two-player two- strategy game describing the same system, where the phenotype of each subpopulation is considered as a strategy. This investigation tests the ideal strategies for three different levels of antibiotic stress. We observe bet-hedging in the form of production of resistant cells which are a costly choice in the absence of the antibiotic stress. Although the population dynamics study is described with a broad range of applicability, we also discuss its applications in the B. subtilis biofilm.",gnd:4242465-3 gnd:4173778-7 gnd:4232790-8
Form-Activity-Movement Interaction Model,"This dissertation investigates the interactions between urban form, allocation of activities, and pedestrian movement in the context of urban planning. The ability to assess the long-term impact of urban planning decisions on what people do and how they get there is of central importance, with various disciplines addressing this topic. This study focuses on approaches proposed by urban morphologists, urban economists, and transportation planners, each aiming the attention at a different part of the form-activity-movement interaction. Even though there is no doubt about the advantages of these highly focused approaches, it remains unclear what is the cost of ignoring the effect of some interactions while considering others. The general aim of this dissertation is to empirically test the validity of the individual models and quantify the impact of this isolationist approach on their precision and bias. For this purpose, we propose a joined form-activity-movement interaction model and conduct an empirical study in Weimar, Germany. We estimate how the urban form and activities affect movement as well as how movement and urban form affect activities. By estimating these effects in isolation and simultaneously, we assess the bias of the individual models. On the one hand, the empirical study results confirm the significance of all interactions suggested by the individual models. On the other hand, we were able to show that when these interactions are estimated in isolation, the resulting predictions are biased. To conclude, we do not question the knowledge brought by transportation planners, urban morphologists, and urban economists. However, we argue that it might be of little use on its own. We see the relevance of this study as being twofold. On the one hand, we proposed a novel methodological framework for the simultaneous estimation of the form-activity-movement interactions.

ULF Waves’ Interaction with Cold and Thermal Particles in the Inner Magnetosphere,"[""This thesis focuses on ULF (Ultra-low-frequency) waves' interaction with plasmasphere particles and ring current ions in the inner magnetosphere. It first reports and reveals mutual effect between ULF waves and plasmasphere using Van Allen Probes data. The differences and similarities of different ring current ions interacting with ULF waves are extensively explored using Cluster data, which provides a potential explanation for O+-dominated ring current during the magnetic storms. Furthermore, this thesis finds a method to study the phase relationship between ULF waves and drift-bounce resonant particles, and proposes that the phase relationship can be used to diagnose the parallel structure of standing wave electric field and energy transfer directions between waves and particles.

Big Data im Spannungsfeld von Wirtschaft und Gerechtigkeit : eine Analyse nach John Rawls,"[""What would John Rawls say about a data-based economy? The lively interest in big data is driven by the possibility of generating information about behaviour and preferences from large volumes of data and thus presenting customers with products that are precisely tailored to their needs, for example.

Selbstkonzeptimmunisierung im Jugendalter,"['Self-concept immunization denotes the adaptive up- and downgrading of the diagnostic value of particular skills for a general self-concept domain - according to the perceived levels of competence in these skills. Up to now theoretical attention was paid to the process within the field of life-span developmental psychology, especially within the context of older age. Within a series of empirical studies with participants from early adulthood to old age, its existence, specific mode of functioning and defensive functionality have been well documented in regards to the maintenance of a stable self, confronted with age(ing)-typical limitations and losses. The present study now introduces new areas of focus. First, an expansion of the age groups that were studied is intended to increase the understanding of the process and its development across wide parts of the lifespan. Second, the question will be addressed if self-concept immunization can adequately contribute to the complex task of identity construction in adolescence. For these purposes, three empirical studies are presented. Study 1 is a broad-based, correlative study, which will beyond testing hypotheses also pursue explorative issues. Adolescents and young adults within a large age spectrum (N = 200, 10-24 years, M = 16.81, SD = 3.27) were surveyed regarding a number of heterogeneous content areas (intelligence, athleticism, independence, courage, reliability, attractiveness). The focus was on the one hand on the development of self-concept immunization within the context of the developing self-concept structure and on the other hand on bivariate and moderating connections between self-concept immunization and self-esteem and measures of subjective well-being. Study 2 (N = 278, 11-24 years, M = 15.45, SD = 3.33) contains an experimental design. With the help of a research paradigm that was derived from Terror Management Theory, the indications of immunizing processes that were found correlatively in Study 1 are to be secured against alternative explanations. With the help of a longitudinal design, Study 3 will on the one hand illustrate the process of self-concept immunization and on the other hand study the functionality of immunizing processes within a natural setting. For this, children before (N = 291, 9-12 years, M = 10.02, SD = 0.59) and after (N = 449, 9-13 years, M = 10.57, SD = 0.65; longitudinal sample: N = 86, M (t1) = 10.05, SD (t1) = 0.61) their transition to secondary school will be surveyed in regards to the self-relevant issues of school achievement and popularity within the classroom setting. The results of all three studies can be integrated into three lines of results. (1) Adolescents do immunize their self-concepts. Beginning as early as late childhood, indications of immunizing processes can be found both cross-sectionally and longitudinally, and immunizing processes can be experimentally induced. However, no age-related change in the degree of immunization has been observed. (2) The immunization does not have a consistent effect on self-esteem and various measures of well-being. (3) Instead, there are indications of an identity-construction function of self-concept immunization: with the help of immunizing processes, the self-concept is more sharply contoured and the own strengths are emphasized. There is evidence that this goes hand in hand with an improvement of well-being. Concluding, the results are discussed within a wider theoretical context. Further research questions that are inspired by these results as well as possibilities to pursue them empirically are presented.', 'Selbstkonzeptimmunisierung bedeutet das adaptive Anpassen individueller Operationalisierungen selbst-relevanter Konzepte an die aktuell wahrgenommenen eigenen Ausprägungen zugehöriger Inhalte. Bislang kam dem theoretisch in der Entwicklungspsychologie der Lebensspanne verorteten Prozess insbesondere im Kontext des höheren Lebensalters Aufmerksamkeit zu. In einer Reihe empirischer Studien mit erwachsenen bis hochaltrigen Probanden wurde seine Existenz, seine spezifische Funktionsweise und seine defensive Funktionalität in Bezug auf die Aufrechterhaltung eines stabilen Selbst in Anbetracht alter(n)stypischer Einschränkungen und Verluste gut belegt. Die vorliegende Arbeit setzt nun neue Schwerpunkte. Zum einen soll eine Ausweitung der untersuchten Altersgruppe dazu dienen, den Prozess und seine Entwicklung tatsächlich über weite Teile der Lebensspanne zu verstehen. Zum anderen soll der Frage nachgegangen werden, ob die Selbstkonzeptimmunisierung geeignet ist, einen Beitrag zur komplexen Aufgabe der Identitätskonstruktion im Jugendalter zu leisten. Dazu werden drei empirische Studien vorgestellt. Studie 1 ist eine breit angelegte, korrelative Studie, die neben hypothesenprüfenden auch explorative Fragestellungen verfolgt. Jugendliche und junge Erwachsene eines breiten Altersspektrums (N = 200, 10-24 Jahre, M = 16.81, SD = 3.27) wurden bezüglich einer Reihe heterogener inhaltlicher Bereiche (Intelligenz, Sportlichkeit, Unabhängigkeit, Mut, Zuverlässigkeit, Attraktivität) befragt. Der inhaltliche Schwerpunkt lag dabei zum einen auf der Entwicklung der Selbstkonzeptimmunisierung im Kontext der sich entwickelnden Selbstkonzeptstruktur, zum anderen auf bivariaten und moderierenden Zusammenhängen der Selbstkonzeptimmunisierung zum Selbstwert und Maßen des subjektiven Wohlbefindens. Studie 2 (N = 278, 11-24 Jahre, M = 15.45, SD = 3.33) beinhaltet ein experimentelles Design. Mit Hilfe eines aus der Terror-Management-Theorie abgeleiteten Forschungsparadigmas sollten die in Studie 1 korrelativ gefundenen Hinweise auf immunisierende Prozesse gegen alternative Erklärungen abgesichert werden. Mit Hilfe eines längsschnittlichen Designs soll in Studie 3 zum einen der Prozess der Selbstkonzeptimmunsierung aufgezeigt, zum anderen die Funktionalität immunisierender Prozesse in einem natürlichen Setting überprüft werden. Dazu wurden Kinder vor (N = 291, 9-12 Jahre, M = 10.02, SD = 0.59) und nach (N = 449, 9-13 Jahre, M = 10.57, SD = 0.65; längsschnittliche Stichprobe: N = 86, M (t1) = 10.05, SD (t1) = 0.61) dem Übertritt auf die weiterführende Schule zu den selbstrelevanten Themen Schulleistung und Beliebtheit im Klassenkontext befragt. Die Ergebnisse aller drei Studien lassen sich zu drei Ergebnislinien integrieren. (1) Jugendliche immunisieren. Bereits ab dem späten Kindesalter lassen sich sowohl im Querschnitt wie auch im Längsschnitt Hinweise auf immunisierende Prozesse finden bzw. diese experimentell induzieren. Eine altersabhängige Veränderung im Ausmaß der Immunisierung lässt sich hingegen nicht beobachten. (2) Die Immunisierung hat keinen konsistenten Effekt auf den Selbstwert sowie diverse Maße psychischen Wohlbefindens. (3) Stattdessen deutet sich eine identitätskonstruktive Funktion der Selbstkonzeptimmunisierung an: mit Hilfe immunisierender Prozesse wird das Selbstkonzept schärfer konturiert, eigene Stärken hervorgehoben. Es zeigen sich Hinweise darauf, dass dies mit einer Verbesserung des Wohlbefindens einhergeht. Abschließend werden durch diese Ergebnisse angeregte weitere Forschungsfragen und Möglichkeiten zu deren empirischen Verfolgung aufgezeigt sowie die Ergebnisse vor einem breiteren theoretischen Kontext diskutiert.']",gnd:4511937-5

Optical characterization of luminescent silicon nanocrystals embedded in glass matrices,"Interstellar dust in nebulae and in the Diffuse Interstellar Medium (DISM) of galaxies contains a component which exhibits efficient visible-near infrared luminescence ranging from 600 to 1000 nm, known as Extended Red Emission (ERE). The ERE, which was first detected by Cohen et al.1 in the spectrum of the Red Rectangle nebula more than 30 years ago, generally appears as a broad structureless emission band (120 to 210-nm-wide) peaking between 600 and 850 nm (see Sec. 2.1.1.1.). Interestingly, the bandwidth of the ERE in-creases with the position of the maximum of the band (Fig. 2.2). The ERE has been observed in many different dusty environments that are illuminated by ultraviolet photons. Therefore, this visible-near infrared emission is probably due to the interaction of ultraviolet photons with dust grains through photoluminescence (PL). The maximal photon conversion efficiency of the PL process leading to ERE approaches 10% (Fig. 2.3). The ERE carrier is a component of interstellar dust that must consist of the most abundant refractive elements in the cosmos (C, O, Si, Fe and Mg), and, once formed, the carriers must survive under a wide range of as-trophysical conditions. Silicon nanocrystals (nc Si) are discussed as possible carriers of the ERE.2, 3 Indeed, nc Si can emit intense PL in a wide spectral range from 600 to 1100 nm. ...",gnd:4162143-8 gnd:4174517-6

"Interacting fermions in external fields, at finite temperature and non-zero density","In this thesis we investigate a certain class of low-dimensional fermionic quantum field theories with four-Fermi interactions. Such theories are commonly used as effective low-energy models for quantum chromodynamics, the theory of strong interactions, and have applications in the realm of condensed-matter physics as well. For our purposes, their most important properties are the notion of chiral symmetry as well as its spontaneous breakdown, which is why a major part of this thesis is devoted to their study. On the one hand, we investigate a certain two-dimensional four-Fermi theory, the so-called chiral Gross-Neveu model, which has a continuous chiral symmetry group. We study the possibility of the model at finite temperature and density to exhibit inhomogeneous regions, where the order parameter for chiral symmetry breaking shows oscillatory behavior with the spatial coordinate. We find that remnant inhomogeneous structures can indeed be found even beyond the mean-field limit, albeit likely only on short scales. On the other hand, we consider a related theory with a discrete chiral group, referred to as the Gross-Neveu model, in three space-time dimensions. There, we shall be concerned with the influence of an external magnetic field on chiral symmetry and its spontaneous breaking. While mean-field approaches predict a rich phase structure for non-zero magnetic field and chemical potential, our simulations suggest that this is not the case in the full quantum theory. For all parameter values within the region of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry, we find the magnetic field to enhance the symmetry breaking even further, a phenomenon referred to as magnetic catalysis. In fact, a major goal of this thesis is to contrast the findings of our lattice simulations with existing mean-field results in order to understand to which extent the latter are capable of representing the full theory.",gnd:4074450-4 gnd:4047984-5 gnd:4158295-0 gnd:4184200-5
Attacking complexity in logic synthesis of asynchronous circuits,"Most of the microelectronic circuits fabricated today are synchronous, i.e. they are driven by one or several clock signals. Synchronous circuit design faces several fundamental challenges such as high-speed clock distribution, integration of multiple cores operating at different clock rates, reduction of power consumption and dealing with voltage, temperature, manufacturing and runtime variations. Asynchronous or clockless design plays a key role in alleviating these challenges, however the design and test of asynchronous circuits is much more difficult in comparison to their synchronous counterparts. A driving force for a widespread use of asynchronous technology is the availability of mature EDA (Electronic Design Automation) tools which provide an entire automated design flow starting from an HDL (Hardware Description Language) specification yielding the final circuit layout. Even though there was much progress in developing such EDA tools for asynchronous circuit design during the last two decades, the maturity level as well as the acceptance of them is still not comparable with tools for synchronous circuit design. In particular, logic synthesis (which implies the application of Boolean minimisation techniques) for the entire system's control path can significantly improve the efficiency of the resulting asynchronous implementation, e.g. in terms of chip area and performance. However, logic synthesis, in particular for asynchronous circuits, suffers from complexity problems. Signal Transitions Graphs (STGs) are labelled Petri nets which are a widely used to specify the interface behaviour of speed independent (SI) circuits - a robust subclass of asynchronous circuits. STG decomposition is a promising approach to tackle complexity problems like state space explosion in logic synthesis of SI circuits. The (structural) decomposition of STGs is guided by a partition of the output signals and generates a usually much smaller component STG for each partition member, i.e. a component STG with a much smaller state space than the initial specification. However, decomposition can result in component STGs that in isolation have so-called irreducible CSC conflicts (i.e. these components are not SI synthesisable anymore) even if the specification has none of them. A new approach is presented to avoid such conflicts by introducing internal communication between the components. So far, STG decompositions are guided by the finest output partitions, i.e. one output per component. However, this might not yield optimal circuit implementations. Efficient heuristics are presented to determine coarser partitions leading to improved circuits in terms of chip area. For the new algorithms correctness proofs are given and their implementations are incorporated into the decomposition tool DESIJ. The presented techniques are successfully applied to some benchmarks - including 'real-life' specifications arising in the context of control resynthesis - which delivered promising results.",gnd:4271581-7 gnd:4159102-1 gnd:4312536-0

Fiber-enhanced Raman spectroscopy in aqueous media,"This dissertation focuses on the investigation and development of an optical biosensor based on fiber-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (FERS) that provides chemical selective and sensitive label-free detection of biomolecules. FERS has been achieved by using various types of liquid core optical fibers, which guide the light within the liquid sample and increase the interaction length with the analyte molecules. The first part of this dissertation explains the FERS technique in detail and describes the current state of research of FERS. Several essential characteristics, such as fiber length, attenuation, material and refractive index, are thoroughly discussed in considerations of Raman intensity enhancement. Liquid-core fibers formed with hollow-core photonic-crystal fibers (HC-PCFs) and polymer fibers are introduced and discussed, as they are the most important breakthroughs. The objective of this research is to develop a robust optical fiber platform based on Raman spectroscopy that shows potential for use in bio-analytical and clinical applications. In this work, I demonstrate a combination of UV-resonance Raman spectroscopy (UV-RRS) and liquid-core fibers, to increases the sensitivity for the detection of low-concentrated pharmaceuticals tremendously. This combined enhancement technique was applied for the detection of bile pigments for monitoring of diseases related to hyperbilirubinemia and hyperbiliverdinemia. Their poor optical quality strongly limits the performances of the polymer-based liquid-core fibers. Therefore, the implementation of HC-PCFs was explored in two different types of optical guiding. Waveguiding in the visible range is achieved for the first time in both kinds of liquid-filled HC-PCFs, and therefore the Raman scattering wavelengths are not anymore limited to the insensitive NIR range. In order to achieve easy-to-use and stable FERS devices for further development, the performance of HC-PCFs in the aspect of light-confinement was studied with the help of a specially designed multi-channel Raman chemical imaging. The optimal fiber length, spatial filtering, and optical coupling were thoroughly analyzed, and an automatic coupling system was developed. With the development of optical fibers, FERS shows increasing potential as a robust, fast, chemical selective and sensitive tool for the detection of biomolecules in clinical, pharmaceutical, and biological applications.",gnd:4193016-2 gnd:4176916-8

Numerical Simulation Models for Thermoelastic Damping Effects,"Finite Element Simulations of dynamically excited structures are mainly influenced by the mass, stiffness, and damping properties of the system, as well as external loads. The prediction quality of dynamic simulations of vibration-sensitive components depends significantly on the use of appropriate damping models. Damping phenomena have a decisive influence on the vibration amplitude and the frequencies of the vibrating structure. However, developing realistic damping models is challenging due to the multiple sources that cause energy dissipation, such as material damping, different types of friction, or various interactions with the environment. This thesis focuses on thermoelastic damping, which is the main cause of material damping in homogeneous materials. The effect is caused by temperature changes due to mechanical strains. In vibrating structures, temperature gradients arise in adjacent tension and compression areas. Depending on the vibration frequency, they result in heat flows, leading to increased entropy and the irreversible transformation of mechanical energy into thermal energy. The central objective of this thesis is the development of efficient simulation methods to incorporate thermoelastic damping in finite element analyses based on modal superposition. The thermoelastic loss factor is derived from the structure's mechanical mode shapes and eigenfrequencies. In subsequent analyses that are performed in the time and frequency domain, it is applied as modal damping. Two approaches are developed to determine the thermoelastic loss in thin-walled plate structures, as well as three-dimensional solid structures. The realistic representation of the dissipation effects is verified by comparing the simulation results with experimentally determined data. Therefore, an experimental setup is developed to measure material damping, excluding other sources of energy dissipation. The three-dimensional solid approach is based on the determination of the generated entropy and therefore the generated heat per vibration cycle, which is a measure for thermoelastic loss in relation to the total strain energy. For thin plate structures, the amount of bending energy in a modal deformation is calculated and summarized in the so-called Modal Bending Factor (MBF). The highest amount of thermoelastic loss occurs in the state of pure bending. Therefore, the MBF enables a quantitative classification of the mode shapes concerning the thermoelastic damping potential. The results of the developed simulations are in good agreement with the experimental results and are appropriate to predict thermoelastic loss factors. Both approaches are based on modal superposition with the advantage of a high computational efficiency. Overall, the modeling of thermoelastic damping represents an important component in a comprehensive damping model, which is necessary to perform realistic simulations of vibration processes.",gnd:1112294007 gnd:4226174-0 gnd:4185143-2 gnd:4001586-5 gnd:4017233-8 gnd:4189667-1

The basic object, a difference operator, makes the computation of a discrete analogue of the rough Laplacian and of the Riemannian curvature tensor possible. A trace of the latter yields a discrete notion of Ricci curvature. Applications to the objects introduced in chapter 1 are discussed in chapter 2. The first application is the proof of a combinatorial formula of Weitzenböck-type that coincides with a decomposition of Weitzenböck-type postulated by Forman in many cases. Second, a combinatorial version of the theorem due to Gauß and Bonnet is proved for combinatorial 2-manifolds. For this theorem a special choice of weights has to be assigned to the cells that yield a Weitzenböck-formula different from the one postulated by Forman. The following sections discuss whether Forman's combinatorial version of a theorem of Bochner for 1-chains can be generalised to the weighted notion of Ricci curvature introduced in chapter 1 ar to p-chains with p>1. The chapter ends with a generalisation of Forman's diameter estimate to the weighted notion of Ricci curvature and simple examples show that his approach is indeed generalised. Part 2 asks for lower bounds for the chromatic number of graphs and hypergraphs obtained using topological methods ...",gnd:4140733-7 gnd:4472286-2 gnd:4130271-0 gnd:4128765-4
Structures & algorithms in hyperbolic random graphs,"Complex networks are ubiquitous in nature and society. They appear in vastly different domains, for instance as social networks, biological interactions or communication networks. Yet in spite of their different origins, these networks share many structural characteristics. For instance, their degree distribution typically follows a power law. This means that the fraction of vertices of degree k is proportional to k^(−β) for some constant β; making these networks highly inhomogeneous. Furthermore, they also typically have high clustering, meaning that links between two nodes are more likely to appear if they have a neighbor in common. To mathematically study the behavior of such networks, they are often modeled as random graphs. Many of the popular models like inhomogeneous random graphs or Preferential Attachment excel at producing a power law degree distribution. Clustering, on the other hand, is in these models either not present or artificially enforced. Hyperbolic random graphs bridge this gap by assuming an underlying…",gnd:4277661-2

Dense stellar systems and massive black holes : sources of gravitational radiation and tidal disruptions,"Gravity dictates the structure of the whole Universe and, although it is triumphantly described by the theory of General Relativity, it is the force that we least understand in nature. One of the cardinal predictions of this theory are black holes. Massive, dark objects are found in the majority of galaxies. Our own galactic center very contains such an object with a mass of about four million solar masses. Are these objects supermassive black holes (SMBHs), or do we need alternatives? The answer lies in the event horizon, the characteristic that defines a black hole. The key to probe the horizon is to model the movement of stars around a SMBH, and the interactions between them, and look for deviations from real observations. Nuclear star clusters harboring a massive, dark object with a mass of up to ~ ten million solar masses are good testbeds to probe the event horizon of the potential SMBH with stars. The channel for interactions between stars and the central MBH are the fact that (a) compact stars and stellar-mass black holes can gradually inspiral into the SMBH due to the emission of gravitational radiation, which is known as an “Extreme Mass Ratio Inspiral” (EMRI), and (b) stars can produce gases which will be accreted by the SMBH through normal stellar evolution, or by collisions and disruptions brought about by the strong central tidal field. Such processes can contribute significantly to the mass of the SMBH. These two processes involve different disciplines, which combined will provide us with detailed information about the fabric of space and time. In this habilitation I present nine articles of my recent work directly related with these topics.",gnd:4158119-2 gnd:4053793-6 gnd:4150454-9 gnd:4169052-7

"Contemporary erosion rates in the Kruger National Park, South Africa, inferred from reservoir siltation surveys","Soil erosion by water is a major environmental issue that affects about 70% of South Africa's land surface and leads to significant environmental and economical costs. In the view of soil conservation, erosion caused by natural conditions (e.g., climate, relief, soils) must be considered largely unavoidable, while accelerated soil erosion due to various forms of land use appears to be 'manageable'. Information about contemporary 'natural' erosion rates in South Africa is, however, still limited which complicates the definition of realistic management goals. In this thesis, mean rates of contemporary erosion are presented for the near-natural savanna landscape of the southern Kruger National Park (KNP) in the northeast of South Africa. Erosion rates were quantified through the investigation of 15 small (≤350 × 103 m3) intermittently dry reservoirs with an operational lifetime of 30 to 65 years and a catchment size of <1 km2 to about 100 km2. The amount of sediment that accumulated within the reservoir basins was quantified based on high-resolution surveys (differential Global Navigation Satellite System and terrestrial laser scanner), sediment mapping (Pürckhauer-type augers), and dry bulk density samples (core rings and clods). The sediment trap efficiency of reservoirs was estimated through modeling. The propagation of uncertainties arising from field work and modeling was examined. The results indicate that erosion rates in the KNP are typically ≤190 t km 2 yr 1. This is comparable to previous results from plot-scale studies on natural erosion rates in South Africa. Erosion rates that were reported for cultivated reservoir catchments outside the KNP are by an order of magnitude higher. At the same time, contemporary erosion rates within the KNP are >4 times higher than long-term (≥105 years) denudation rates ascertained from cosmogenic beryllium-10 concentrations. These results have notable implications concerning tolerable soil loss rates in the vicinity of the KNP.",gnd:4007367-1
Socializing development : transnational social movement advocacy and the human rights accountability of multilateral development banks,"As multilateral development banks increasingly gained influence in shaping global development, transnational social movements pushed to hold them accountable for their human rights impact towards communities. Leon Valentin Schettler presents a novel causal mechanism of movement advocacy towards MDBs, combining disruptive and conventional tactics. Systematically comparing the evolution of human rights standards and complaint mechanisms over the last three decades, he reveals how the combination of 1) declining US hegemony, 2) counter-mobilization by China and 3) movement cooptation by the World Bank bureaucracy led to a dilution of human rights accountability in the 2010s.",gnd:4152437-8 gnd:4120509-1 gnd:4014957-2
New silicion nanocrystal materials for photovoltaic applications,"This Ph.D. thesis addresses the deposition, characterization and improvement of Si nanocrystal layers embedded in a SiC matrix (Si NC/SiC) as future absorber material for top cells of an all-Si tandem solar cell. The required enlargement of the Si NC bandgap is aimed to achieve with the help of quantum confinement (QC). No unambiguous evidence of QC in Si NC/SiC samples were presented in the literature up to now. Even though this also was not possible during this Ph.D. thesis, some necessary preconditions for QC were successfully complied, which are a better understanding and control of the crystallization mechanism, size control of the Si NC and defect passivation. The deposition of amorphous SixC1-x:H layers was conducted by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition. During the annealing step subsequent to layer deposition, H effusion, formation of Si NC, and crystallization of the SiC matrix occurs. All Si NC/SiC samples were subjected to a comprehensive structural and optical characterization. The application of grazing incidence X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared and Raman measurements to Si NC/SiC thin films were significantly improved during this work. The Si NC size control is an indispensable precondition for quantum confinement. For this purpose, two routes were proposed in this work. The Si NC size is shown to increase with increasing Si content of the SixC1-x:H layers. Thus, the Si NC size can be adjusted by adjusting the Si content. The advantage of this method is the fact that singlelayers can be deposited instead of multilayers (ML). The disadvantage is the uncontrollability of the Si NC spacing and the wide size distribution. The second route is with the help of a ML structure. Usually, Si NC/SiC ML structures show strong intermixing during the annealing step and are therefore not suitable for Si NC size control. In this work it is shown that the ML structure can be hindered from intermixing by oxygen incorporation during deposition.",gnd:4121476-6 gnd:7574326-7 gnd:4077445-4
Optische und elektrische Spektroskopie an alternativen Absorbermaterialien für organische Solarzellen,"['In this thesis several issues dealing with organic photovoltaics are discussed. Optical measurements on polymers and polymer-fullerene blends are shown to demonstrate, in principle, if these materials and material combinations are suitable for organic solar cell applications.

These materials show potential but they do not reach the efficiency of standard organic solar cells. Further, different fullerene derivatives are analyzed.

Earth's magnetic field over the last 1000 years,"To investigate the reliability and stability of spherical harmonic models based on archeo/-paleomagnetic data, 2000 Geomagnetic models were calculated. All models are based on the same data set but with randomized uncertainties. Comparison of these models to the geomagnetic field model gufm1 showed that large scale magnetic field structures up to spherical harmonic degree 4 are stable throughout all models. Through a ranking of all models by comparing the dipole coefficients to gufm1 more realistic uncertainty estimates were derived than the authors of the data provide. The derived uncertainty estimates were used in further modelling, which combines archeo/-paleomagnetic and historical data. The huge difference in data count, accuracy and coverage of these two very different data sources made it necessary to introduce a time dependent spatial damping, which was constructed to constrain the spatial complexity of the model.

"Large area crystal surfaces of precisely side-branched polyethylenes : preparation, surface order and functionalization","Zusammenfassung: Upon crystallization of polymers containing precisely spaced side-branches, the side-branches are excluded from the crystalline core of the lamellar crystal. Thus, the surfaces of these crystals are covered by side-branches. By using carboxyl groups as side-branches, which can be ionized in aqueous environments, self-stabilized nanocrystal dispersions can be prepared. In principle, the carboxyl groups also allow for the covalent attachment of functional molecules to the lamellar crystals using well established strategies for amide bond formation. However, the fold surfaces of the crystals need to be highly ordered so that the carboxyl groups are accessible for functionalization.From x-ray scattering in semicrystalline bulk, we found that precisely spaced side-groups do not predefine the thickness of the crystalline core under all crystallization conditions. In addition, the part of the fold layer containing carboxyl groups had a considerable thickness, indicating that there is a substantial disorder in the fold surfaces of lamellar crystals of polymers containing precisely spaced side-branches",gnd:4033215-9 gnd:4076241-5

Computational methods for the analysis of mass spectrometry imaging data,"A powerful enhancement to MS-based detection is the addition of spatial information to the chemical data; an approach called mass spectrometry imaging (MSI). MSI enables two- and three-dimensional overviews of hundreds of molecular species over a wide mass range in complex biological samples. In this work, we present two computational methods and a workflow that address three different aspects of MSI data analysis: correction of mass shifts, unsupervised exploration of the data and importance of preprocessing and chemometrics to extract meaningful information from the data. We introduce a new lock mass-free recalibration procedure that enables to significantly reduce these mass shift effects in MSI data. Our method exploits similarities amongst peaklist pairs and takes advantage of the spatial context in three different ways, to perform mass correction in an iterative manner. As an extension of this work, we also present a Java-based tool, MSICorrect, that implements our recalibration approach and also allows data visualization. In the next part, an unsupervised approach to rank ion intensity maps based on the abundance of their spatial pattern is presented. Our method provides a score to every ion intensity map based on the abundance of spatial pattern present in it and then ranks all the maps using it. To know which masses exhibit similar spatial distribution, our method uses spatial-similarity based grouping to provide lists of masses that exhibit similar distribution patterns. In the last part, we demonstrate the application of a data preprocessing and multivariate analysis pipeline to a real-world biological dataset. We demonstrate this by applying the full pipeline to a high-resolution MSI dataset acquired from the leaf surface of Black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa).

Dynamical localization in driven helium,"['Zusammenfassung: The thesis provides a comprehensive introduction to the quantum mechanics of decaying systems, which either autoionize or decay due to their interaction with an external time-dependent field. The complex rotation method provides direct access to the energy spectrum of both types of systems, from which we extract resonance energies and ionization rates. We express the time evolution operator in terms of the complex rotated eigenstates and analyze its action onto initially bound, square integrable states, as well as onto non-normalizable resonance states with complex energy and wavepackets of freely moving particles.The helium atom, which is probably the simplest autoionizing system realized in nature, exhibits all prominent features of complex decaying systems, such as strong chaos, regular regions in phase space and decay into multiple continua. We analyze the quantum mechanics of the collinear eZe and Zee configurations, which account for opposite types of the classical motion realized in the three-dimensional system. We show that the fully chaotic classical dynamics of the eZe configuration, with the nucleus between the electrons, induces fast autoionization of the quantum states, triggered by the triple collision of both electrons with the nucleus. In contrast, the adiabatic separation of the motions of the inner and outer electron stabilizes the Zee configuration against autoionization. The accuracy of the atomic energy levels obtained from a semiclassical approach shows that the Zee dynamics is nearly integrable.The electronic excitation of atomic systems exposed to an electromagnetic field may be hampered by dynamical (Anderson) localization. We detect localization in microwave-driven Zee helium due to the suppression of field-induced ionization. In the presence of fast autoionization in eZe Rydberg atoms, we directly monitor the exponential suppression of the field-induced excitation process in energy space due to dynamical localization. By tuning the electron-electron Coulomb repulsion and the initial excitation of both electrons, we investigate the impact of particle-particle interactions on localization, which is a problem of great common interest, not only in AMO but also in condensed matter physics. We explain quantitatively the weakening of localization due to the Coulomb interaction, and establish a scaling law which connects the localization length with the interaction strength and the intensity of the driving field', 'Zusammenfassung: Die vorliegende Arbeit enthält eine umfassende Einführung in die Quantenmechanik zerfallender Systeme, die entweder autoionisieren oder in Wechselwirkung mit einem externen, zeitlich veränderlichen Feld zerfallen.

Nicotiana attenuata protein kinases mediate plant growth and resistance to insect herbivores,"Protein kinases modulate developmental and adaptation processes in the plant kingdom. While MAPK signaling has been intensively studied for the involvement in growth, defense and growth regulation, more and more studies have shown that CDPKs also function in these physiological processes. N. attenuata is an annual solanaceous plant, which germinates only after fire. In its natural habitat in the Great Basin Desert in Utah, USA, after being attacked by the specialist, tobacco hornworm Manduca sexta, N. attenuata has developed many specific and fine-tuned responses to cope with herbivore challenges. It has been shown that two MAPKs, NaSIPK and NaWIPK are involved in defense against M. sexta attack, by controlling the plant hormone, jasmonic acid (JA). The burst of JA after herbivore recognition is important to induce defense responses, such as the production of small secondary metabolites (e.g. nicotine) and defensive proteins – trypsin proteinase inhibitor (TPI). MAPKs are the last element in a MAPK cascade: MAPKKKs activate MAPKKs, which in turn phosphorylate MAPKs. In order to investigate the function of MAPK cascades in plant-herbivore interactions, using N. attenuata and M. sexta as the model system, I studied the function of five MAPKKs in plant defense against herbivores.",gnd:4195374-5 gnd:4416206-6 gnd:4318717-1 gnd:4175996-5 gnd:4496344-0
Engineering of enzymatic redox cascades involving oxygenases,"['Cascade reactions are not only of interest to chemists and biotechnologists, but also to life in general, because every metabolic reaction resembles a cascade reaction. This principle of substrate/intermediate channeling was only adapted by scientists. That way especially one-pot reactions became very attractive as for this no isolation of intermediates is necessary. Furthermore, unstable or toxic intermediates are only produced in low amounts and directly transformed in situ. In this PhD thesis two previously established cascade reactions were subject of further optimization. In the first part, a cascade reaction established in a DFG-funded project (Bo1862/6-1)in cooperation with the Vienna Technical University (Austria) for the production of chiral lactones was further optimized and extended. Therefore, on the one hand the genes encoding the needed enzymes were cloned for co-expression into a single plasmid in different arrangements to be expressed in pseudo-operon mode, with the aim to lower the metabolic burden of the cascade host cell. One out of the welve created constructs showed a reasonable activity of 15.3 ± 1.2 U · gCDW-1. On the other hand, this cascade reaction was aimed to be extended by the use of a hydroxylating enzyme to enable the use of limonene as renewable and chiral precursor for the proposed production of chiral polymers. Therefore, the feasibility of cytochrome P450-monooxygenases was studied.

"Identification and characterisation of gallic acid decarboxylase (Agdc1p) and catechol-1,2-dioxygenase (Acdo1p) and their role in the degradation of Tannic Acid in the Yeast Blastobotrys (Arxula) adeninivorans","['Phenolics and its derivatives are aromatic compounds with a wide range of industrial applications. Gallic acid, protocatechuic acid, catechol or pyrogallol are only a few examples of industrially relevant aromatics. The production of bulk fine chemicals primarily for chemical and pharmaceutical industry has put a strong emphasis on optimizing manufacturing conditions. Commercial production of many chemicals is still based on organic chemical synthesis using petroleum derivatives as starting material. Since these processes are considered environmentally unfriendly and posing an irresponsible strain on limited fossil resources, much attention is paid to the development of new microbial factories for the bioproduction of industrially relevant chemicals using renewable sources or organic pollutants as starting material. Arxula adeninivoras is a non-conventional yeast possessing attractive properties for industrial application such as thermo- and osmotolerance. Another major advantage of this organism is its broad substrate spectrum with tannin at the forefront. The present project is dedicated to the study of the tannic acid degradation pathway in A. adeninivorans.

Rate measurements open the possibility to estimate the impact of viruses on indigenous microbial communities, e.g. virus-induced prokaryotic mortality. The other two studies were based on previous findings that reported virus-to-cell ratios dramatically increased with depth in SPG sediments.

Characterization of atmospheric processes related to hydro-meteorological extreme events over the south-central Andes,"The significant environmental and socioeconomic consequences of hydrometeorological extreme events, such as extreme rainfall, are constituted as a most important motivation for analyzing these events in the south-central Andes of NW Argentina. The steep topographic and climatic gradients and their interactions frequently lead to the formation of deep convective storms and consequently trigger extreme rainfall generation. In this dissertation, I focus on identifying the dominant climatic variables and atmospheric conditions and their spatiotemporal variability leading to deep convection and extreme rainfall in the south-central Andes. This dissertation first examines the significant contribution of temperature on atmospheric humidity (dew-point temperature, Td) and on convection (convective available potential energy, CAPE) for deep convective storms and hence, extreme rainfall along the topographic and climatic gradients.

Legume chemistry and the specificity of the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum) host races,"The pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum) is a complex of at least 15 genetically different host races that are native to specific legume plants but can all develop on the universal host plant Vicia faba. Despite much research, it is still unclear why pea aphid host races can accept and colonize their native host plants while non-native host races are not. To determine the changes in the host plant chemistry and their possible influence in the specificity of the pea aphid host races, we used several metabolomics aproaches on full factorial experimental set ups by infesting separately four different plant species (Medicago sativa, Trifolium pratense, Pisum sativum, and Vicia faba) with native and non-native pea aphid clones of various host races. Our results from the non-targeted and targeted approaches suggested that the plant species investigated have developed different complexities of chemicals to defend themselves from the attack of herbivores including phloem feeders. Our results also suggested that A. pisum clones have evolved different feeding strategies to manipulate the host plant defense signaling, reduced deterrence or toxicity, improved host quality, reduction of enemies, and improved quality of future food sources in the vicinity to perform better on these plants. We have selected a group of polar and non-polar secondary metabolites that might be associated with the discrimination and compatibility of the pea aphid host races with the different legume species used in this project. However, additional experimentation is necessary to fully understand the effects and influence of these compounds in the specificity of the pea aphid host races.",gnd:4026066-5 gnd:4076052-2 gnd:4113361-4 gnd:4283667-0 gnd:4322820-3

Development of hydrogen storage systems using Sodium alanate,"['Hydrogen storage systems based on sodium alanate are studied, modelled, and optimised, on the basis of both experimental and theoretical approaches.

Lower bounds for Auslander's representation dimension,"The notion of representation dimension of a finite dimensional algebra has been introduced by Auslander. He has shown that an algebra is of finite representation type if and only if its representation dimension is at most two. He has expected that the representation dimension of a representation infinite algebra should measure how far this algebra is from being representation finite. In many cases, and, thanks to Iyama, also in general, upper bounds for the representation dimension are known. However there are non-trivial lower bounds only for two (similarly constructed) series of algebras. In this thesis new lower bounds for Auslander's representation dimension are constructed, and more general methods are developed. First we consider group algebras of elementary abelian groups. We show that their representation dimension is greater than the rank of the group. This leads to a proof of a conjecture of Benson concerning the Loewy length of blocks of group algebras. Then a notion of dimension of a module category is introduced. This notion enables us to find better lower bounds for the representation dimension. In particular it allows us for the first time to determine the value of the representation dimension of non-self-injective algebras of representation dimension greater than three ...",gnd:4148816-7
"Sedimentary DNA-based reconstruction of cyanobacterial communities from Lake Tiefer See, NE Germany, for the last 11,000 years","Climate change and human-driven eutrophication promote the spread of harmful cyanobacteria blooms in lakes worldwide, which affects water quality and impairs the aquatic food chain.

Development of a user-friendly heterologous expression system and its applications for natural product biosynthesis,"Heterologous expression of natural product biosynthetic pathways is of rising interest to fungal bioactive compound discovery and engineering. However, most eukaryotic genes are regulated by individual regulatory elements and transcribed as monocistronic mRNA. Therefore, regardless of plasmid transformation or chromosomal integration of DNA, reconstruction and expression of biosynthetic gene clusters in the eukaryotic recipient require improved assembling pipeline of vectors and coordinated control of expression of multiple genes. Moreover, valuable medicine biosynthesis based on heterologous expression remains an ongoing challenge owing to the strict metabolic regulation in the chosen host. To circumvent these obstacles, a specialized vector was designed, for flexible but modularized construction of multiple genes. In the scheme, TEV protease and its recognition site combined with a previously documented P2A-mediated expression system, allow expression of eukaryotic genes in a “polycistronic” mRNA by co-translational and post-translational cleavages. As another highlight, the split fluorescent protein was introduced for visualizing and rapid screening of fungal transformants.

Applying the Monte-Carlo-Method, the vessels speed, its floating condition and the environmental conditions (wind and sea state) are determined for a sufficient number of parameter sets. Subsequently the equilibrium condition for the propulsion point is computed, utilising an already implemented manoeuvring algorithm. Following this proceeding, it is possible to identify the specific requirement profile and to align the vessels design or the operating conditions (e.g. trim distribution) with this profile. Since this methodology computes rather fast, it offers the possibility to assess the impact of parametric design variations economically and ecologically. This assessment can be adjusted to different vessel types, shipping routes and connected to this the commodity flow, tailored to the individual needs. In order to validate the calculation methods feasibility, the algorithms results have been checked against measured long-term data from various vessels of different type in operation.', 'Diese Arbeit beschreibt einen neu entwickelten Ansatz für die Bewertung und Optimierung von Schiffsentwürfen. Der in diesem Zusammenhang implementierte Simulationsalgorithmus verwendet die Monte Carlo Methode, um die Einsatzbedingungen während eines frei wählbaren Zeitraumes für ein projektiertes bzw. ein bereits im Dienst befindliches Schiff zu vorherzusagen bzw. zu reproduzieren. Auf der Grundlage von statistisch aufbereiteten schiffsspezifischen und umweltbedingten Daten in Kombination mit direkten Berechnungen der Propulsion ist es möglich, Schiffsentwürfe in Bezug auf verschiedene Parameter zu bewerten. Diese Parameter können sich sowohl auf den Schiffsentwurf an sich als auch auf dessen Betrieb beziehen. Durch Verwendung der Monte Carlo Methode wird eine ausreichende Anzahl von Betriebspunkten generiert. Diese Punkte beinhalten die Schiffsgeschwindigkeit, die Schwimmlage und die Umweltbedingungen (Wind und Seegang). Nachfolgend wird die Gleichgewichtsbedingung für den Propulsionspunkt unter Verwendung eines bereits verfügbaren und validierten Manövrieralgorithmus berechnet. Durch diese Methode ist es möglich, ein spezifisches Anforderungsprofil zu erstellen und den Schiffsentwurf bzw. das Operationsprofil (z.B. die Trimmverteilung) dahingehend abzustimmen. Die vergleichsweise geringen Rechenzeiten gestatten es, die Auswirkungen von parametrischen Entwurfsvariationen sowohl ökonomisch als auch ökologisch zu bemessen. Dieses Vorgehen kann an verschiedene Schiffstypen, Fahrtgebiete und damit eng verknüpft auch das jeweilige Frachtaufkommen angepasst und so direkt auf die individuellen Bedürfnisse zugeschnitten werden.

Modeling and inversion of airborne full tensor magnetic gradiometry data in the Thuringian basin and forest,"The recent development of airborne full tensor magnetic gradiometer (FTMG) systems, based on superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUID), allows to obtain the full magnetic gradient tensor of the Earth's magnetic field of large areas (10x10 km). This system allows acquiring all components of the magnetic gradient tensor. This tensor exhibits some advantages over conventional airborne magnetic field data, e.g. a higher spatial resolution and additional directional sensitivity. In this work a FTMG system was applied in the framework of the multidisciplinary INFLUINS project (Integrated fluid dynamics in sedimentary basins) in order investigate different areas in the Thuringian Basin and the neighboring highlands. Main goal was to map magnetic lineaments along major fault zones and to demonstrate the advantages of airborne FTMG. Full tensor data sets have been acquired with very low system noise of only 60 (pT/m). Two different case studies are presented: In the first case study a strong magnetic anomaly in the center of the Thuringian Forest, caused by the magmatic intrusion of the Höhenberger dolerite is analyzed, which exhibits indications of a significant remanent magnetization. Multiple magnetization vector inversions were performed using either the full magnetic gradient tensor or only the total field anomaly data. The inversion results are evaluated using magnetization directions acquired by paleomagnetic sampling and available geological information. In the second case study, a small magnetic anomaly was investigated. It was discovered while mapping magnetic anomalies along the Eichenberg-Gotha-Saalfeld fault zone, which is one of the major fault zones in the Thuringian Basin. The detected lineament is interpreted using the components of the magnetic gradient tensor, additional ground based geo-electrical data and available geological information. The inversion of the magnetic gradients revealed a steeply dipping zone of mostly induced magnetization.",gnd:4074450-4 gnd:4728874-7
Computation of A∞ algebras in group cohomology,"The applicability of A1-structures, as introduced by Stasheff (1963) in the setting of algebra, or more specifically in representation theory has gradually grown. With Keller (2002, 2001) and Lu, Palmieri, Wu, and Zhang (2007, 2006), the benefits of A1-algebra structures to the theory of representations and of cohomology of various classes of algebras have been made explicit. By the results in these papers, there is the potential to use A1-structures in modular group cohomology  the group cohomology A1-algebra would determine the corresponding group ring completely. However, the calculational techniques available do not lend themselves easily to calculation of these structures, nor are there particularly many examples at hand. The only examples that do exist in deeper treatment for modular finite group cohomology are the finite cyclic groups.",gnd:4148816-7 gnd:4164609-5
Potential of millimeter- and submillimeter-wave satellite observations for hydrometeor studies,"The distribution of hydrometeors is highly variable in space and time, since it is the result of a complex chain of processes with scales from microphysical (1e-6 m) to synoptical (1e3 m). It is a challenging task to observe these highly variable atmospheric constituents on a global scale with a temporal and spatial resolution sufficient for numerical weather prediction (NWP) and hydrological purposes. This study investigates the potential of the millimeter- and submillimeter-wavelength range on space-borne sensors for hydrometeor and surface precipitation rate observations. The approach is based on simulations with cloud resolving models (CRMs) coupled to a radiative transfer (RT) model. The simulations are performed for mid-latitude cases covering a broad band of precipitation events such as heavy convective and light stratiform winter precipitation. Realistic atmospheric conditions were simulated with two mesoscale CRMs: the Meso-scale NonHydrostatic model (Meso-NH) on a 10 km and the COSMO-DE (COnsortium for Small-scale MOdeling-DEutschland) on a 2.8 km horizontal resolution. When calculating brightness temperatures for satellite observations with the one-dimensional radiative transfer model MWMOD (MicroWave MODel), the detailed cloud microphysics and the three-dimensional fields of temperature, humidity, and pressure of the CRMs are considered in the calculation of the interaction parameters ...",gnd:4140530-4 gnd:4349242-3

Deconvolution problems in density estimation,"The main focus of this work lies on generalizations of the usual nonparametric density estimation problem to cases where one does not have access to the data associated with the density of interest directly. In the first part errors-in-variables models are studied, where the data is disturbed by additive error effects. The purpose here is to get results, when the strong assumption that one knows the distribution of the errors is not suitable. Therefore, on the one hand rates of consistency for two approximative deconvolution procedures are proved - the so-called TAYLEX and SIMEX methods, on the other hand new models are introduced, where only contaminated data, but with different contamination, is used to derive consistent estimators. In these new models, in some situations a deterioration of the convergence rates appears, compared to the rates for a completely known error distribution. Yet, it is to be expected that the rates from classical models are not attainable here. In a second part it is assumed that some of the observations are measurements where the quantity of interest is accumulated. This situation is described by the aggregated data models. There new estimators for density estimation are introduced that are able to use data with different group sizes. It is shown here that these estimators reach the optimal rates of convergence attainable in the studied setting. Both in errors-in-variables models and in aggregated data models it was possible to introduce estimation procedures that fit realistic datasets better than the classical approaches.",gnd:4014854-3

In addition to a comprehensive introduction to topological matter, this thesis provides a new perspective on correlated topological matter. The book comprises three subjects, in which electron correlations in different forms are considered. The first focuses on Coulomb interactions for massless Dirac fermions. Using a perturbative approach, the author reveals emergent Lorentz invariance in a low-energy limit and discusses how to probe the Lorentz invariance experimentally. The second subject aims to show a principle for synthesizing topological insulators with common, light elements. The interplay between the spin–orbit interaction and electron correlation is considered, and Hund's rule and electron filling are consequently found to play a key role for a strong spin–orbit interaction important for topological insulators. The last subject is classification of topological crystalline insulators in the presence of electron correlation. Unlike non-interacting topological insulators, such two- and three-dimensional correlated insulators with mirror symmetry are demonstrated to be characterized, respectively, by the Z4 and Z8 group by using the bosonization technique and a geometrical consideration.""]",gnd:4121256-3 gnd:4177773-6 gnd:4165343-9 gnd:4287505-5 gnd:4147494-6 gnd:4129534-1 gnd:4150116-0 gnd:4047982-1 gnd:1035519526
Unveiling the epoch of reionization by simulations and high-redshift galaxies,"The Epoch of Reionization marks after recombination the second major change in the ionization state of the universe, going from a neutral to an ionized state. It starts with the appearance of the first stars and galaxies; a fraction of high-energy photons emitted from galaxies permeate into the intergalactic medium (IGM) and gradually ionize the hydrogen, until the IGM is completely ionized at z~6 (Fan et al., 2006). While the progress of reionization is driven by galaxy evolution, it changes the ionization and thermal state of the IGM substantially and affects subsequent structure and galaxy formation by various feedback mechanisms. Understanding this interaction between reionization and galaxy formation is further impeded by a lack of understanding of the high-redshift galactic properties such as the dust distribution and the escape fraction of ionizing photons. Lyman Alpha Emitters (LAEs) represent a sample of high-redshift galaxies that are sensitive to all these galactic properties and the effects of reionization.

Partialsynthese maßgeschneiderter Photosensibilisatoren vom Chlorintyp und Studien zur pharmazeutischen Anwendung in der Photodynamischen Therapie,"Photodynamic therapy, photosensitizers, chlorins, amphiphilic properties. - Photodynamic therapy is still in its initial stages. Non-acceptance in clinical application so far is due to the need for appropriate photosensitizers fulfilling several requirements. However, in the present state of research, amphiphilic chlorins without charges or ionic moieties are the most promising chromophores. Partial water-solubility or solubility in physiological solvents is important for a clinical application. This thesis deals with the synthesis of chlorin-carbohydrate-amides of various degrees of hydrophilicity, followed by the investigation of their photophysical and bio-medical properties. The synthesis is based on Deuteroporphyrin, which can be converted into chlorins with different alkyl chains by partial synthesis. Another approach is based on the substitution of the chromophores of chlorin e6 and its derivatives. Consequently, the carboxylic moieties were amidated successfully with acyclic sugar amines. The solubility of these amides ranges from moderate to good water-solubility. For all derivatives photophysical measurements showed enhanced absorption qualities compared to those of Photofrin, the currently best reviewed and medically most applied photosensitizer.",gnd:4386873-3 gnd:4312776-9 gnd:4601882-7
Structure analysis of the Perseus and the Cepheus B molecular clouds,"In the first part of this work, I study the structural properties of Galactic molecular clouds. The \Delta-variance method is applied to both the CO integrated intensity maps and the velocity channel maps that present spatial distribution of line intensities at each successive velocity interval. The spectral index \beta of the corresponding power spectrum is determined. Its variation across the cloud and across the lines is studied. It is found that the power spectra of all CO line integrated maps of the whole complex show the same index, \beta = 3.1, for scales between about 0.2 and 3 pc, independent of isotopomer and rotational transition. However, the CO maps of individual subregions show a variation of \beta. The 12CO 3--2 data provide a spread of indices between 2.9 in L 1455 and 3.5 in NGC 1333. In general, active star forming regions show a larger power-law exponent. I use the velocity channel analysis to study the statistical relation between the neighboring channel maps. Some theory predicts systematic increase of the spectral index with channel width. Such systematic increase is only detected in the blue line wings for the CO data. I apply Gaussclumps to the whole observed Perseus cloud and seven sub-regions, and to derive the clump properties as traced in 13CO 1--0 and 2--1. With the individual clumps identified, their properties such as mass, size, velocity width are derived. The clumps identified have a power law mass spectrum, and a power law index 1.9 of clump mass spectra. The virial parameter, which is the ratio between virial mass and the mass estimated from the Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) analysis, is used to characterize the equilibrium state of a clump. The LTE assumes that all distribution functions characterizing the material and its interaction with the radiation field at one position are given by thermodynamic equilibrium relations at local values of the temperature and density. Virial mass here is the mass of a clump in statistical equilibrium derived by using the virial theorem.

Investigating the mechanism of a novel glycine-dependent riboswitch and a putative non-coding regulatory RNA in Streptococcus pyogenes,"We investigated gene expression regulation by a putative glycine(Gly) riboswitch located in the 5′-UTR of a SAF protein gene in the S.pyogenes.

RT-qPCR showed that in the presence of Gly (≥1 mM), expression of the gene was downregulated. Growth in the presence of 0.1 mM Gly led to the production of a full-length transcript. We conclude that the Gly riboswitch in S. pyogenes represses gene expression in the presence of high Gly concentrations.<eng>",gnd:7721130-3 gnd:4183663-7
"On the assessment of surface urban heat island : size, urban form, and seasonality","To what extent cities can be made sustainable under the mega-trends of urbanization and climate change remains a matter of unresolved scientific debate. Our inability in answering this question lies partly in the deficient knowledge regarding pivotal humanenvironment interactions.

Worse still, heat waves are being observed and are projected to increase in both frequency and intensity, which further impairs the well-being of urban dwellers. Albeit with a substantial increase in the number of publications on UHI in the recent decades, the diverse urban-rural definitions applied in previous studies have remarkably hampered the general comparability of results achieved.

Cognitive modeling and verbal semantics : a representational framework based on UML,"This book presents a unique approach towards the study of verbal meaning.

The new graphical framework combines formal precision with conceptual flexibility and allows the representation of very complicated details of verbal meaning, thereby offering a solution for different semantic problems such as polysemy and context-dependency. Besides the framework's development, the book contains a cognitive interpretation of important modeling elements, a discussion of general issues in connection with and well-elaborated applications of the framework. Since the framework is graphical in nature, the book contains many annotated figures, and the framework's modeling elements are illustrated by example diagrams.

New anode- and cathode-active materials for organic batteries,"The development and synthesis of new polymers for organic batteries is a long and difficult process rife with challenges. However, the reward for this are suitable materials for the next generation of secondary batteries. The investigations within the scope of this thesis are focused on the discovery of new redox-active polymers suitable as active materials in batteries. These organic battery materials can compete with inorganic materials in terms of theoretical capacity, power and energy density. The most beneficial features of these compounds like light weight, flexibility, printability and environmental friendliness make them promising candidates for secondary organic batteries. With the vast repertoire of known redox-active species the transfer of those into a polymeric structure and their subsequent electrochemical testing can provide access to a wide variety of different electrode materials. In this thesis new polymers were developed as active battery-materials and tested for their capabilities in batteries. This includes the functionalization and optimization of well-known polymers like galvinoxyles and the incorporation of less-known redox-materials in polymeric compounds. Several new polymers, containing anode- or cathode-active compounds were synthesized. Galvinoxyl- and phenoxyl-compounds are addressed as well as quinones, anthraquinones and nitroxides. These polymeric compounds were subsequently intensively tested for their application as electrode material and incorporated into batteries, including the fabrication of a battery using inkjet-printing. By changing the functional groups of the polymers, their redox-potentials, stability or solubility are changed and new batteries were created. Those different batteries show the versatility of polymers as electrode-materials and the possibility to adjust a batteries capability to the desired specifications.",gnd:4319759-0 gnd:4403842-2 gnd:4155916-2 gnd:4004687-4

Tailored growth of transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers and heterostructures for electronic and optoelectronic applications,"2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and their heterostructures have shown great potential for next-generation device applications due to their unique and versatile electronic, optical and chemical properties. However, to exploit their potential in applications, it is crucial to establish reliable and reproducible synthesis methods for these atomically thin materials. In addition, efficient strategies for their synthesis with tailored properties must be developed. This work focuses on developing chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth techniques for a range of TMD monolayers and their heterostructures, understanding the underlying growth mechanism, investigating their structure-property relationships, and exploring their functional applications. The work starts with the development of MoSe2-WSe2 lateral heterostructures, demonstrating the formation of high-quality atomically sharp p-n junctions. The synthesis of Janus SeMoS TMDs, with their unique asymmetric atomic configurations, presents the emergence of novel optical phenomena such as valley Zeeman splitting. The work also innovates in the direct growth of TMD monolayers on curved photonic structures, expanding the potential for photonic applications.

In this book, the author therefore examines the question of whether the application of § 242 of the BGB in order to regulate corporate behaviour actually undermines the objective of the legislator in the sense that it renders impeding competitive behaviour below the specific thresholds of competition law harmless.', 'Die Missbräuchlichkeit unternehmerischen Marktverhaltens ist zentrales Kriterium deutscher und EU-kartellrechtlicher Verbote, die auch privatrechtlich durchgesetzt werden können. Diese Verbote richten sich aber nur an Unternehmen, die marktbeherrschend sind oder relative Marktmacht innehaben. Der auf § 242 BGB gestützte Rechtsmissbrauchseinwand findet demgegenüber auf alle Privatrechtssubjekte Anwendung, einschließlich Unternehmen unabhängig ihrer Marktstellung. Sowohl das kartellrechtliche Missbrauchsverbot als auch der Rechtsmissbrauchseinwand ermöglichen Marktteilnehmern, die von behindernden unternehmerischen Praktiken betroffen sind, die privatrechtliche Abwehr solcher Praktiken. Der Autor untersucht daher die Frage, ob der Einsatz des § 242 BGB zur Kontrolle unternehmerischen Verhaltens eine im Kartellrecht zum Ausdruck kommende gesetzgeberische Wertung unterläuft, dass behinderndes Wettbewerbsverhalten unterhalb der kartellrechtlichen Aufgreifschwellen unbedenklich ist.']",gnd:4138547-0 gnd:4405205-4 gnd:4137659-6 gnd:4029788-3 gnd:4048806-8
"Bio-based building blocks from 5-hydroxymethylfurfural via 1-hydroxyhexane-2,5-dione as intermediate","This dissertation reports on the synthesis and applications of the biomass-derived 1-hydroxyhexane-2,5-dione (HHD). A new catalytic process was developed for the hydrogenation/hydrolytic ring opening of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) resulting in the formation of HHD in good yields. Furthermore, HHD was converted to useful follow-up products including pyrroles and cyclopentanone derivatives. Additionally, readily accessible rhenium(VII) oxide was used for the catalytic deoxydehydration of renewable triols under solvent-free and aerobic conditions resulting in formation of the hydroxy-alkenes.<eng>",gnd:4160891-4 gnd:4029919-3
Structural evolution of the Taiwan fold-and-thrust belt gleaned from balanced cross sections and tectono-metamorphic studies in the Central Range,"Taiwan is situated along an active plate boundary between the Eurasian Plate and the Philippine Sea Plate, with a convergence rate at about 80 mm/yr. The convergence results in an ongoing mountain building that displays a structure particularly complex. This dissertation mainly focuses on the structural and tectonic evolution of the Taiwan fold-and-thrust belt and its eastern metamorphic Yuli Belt in the Central Range. The study involves geological mapping, cross-section construction and balancing, whole-rock geochemistry analysis, Raman spectroscopic geothermometry, and palaeogeographic reconstructions. (1) Three crustal-scale geological cross-sections at various latitudes of the Taiwan fold-and-thrust belt were constructed. The largely Eurasian basement overthrust the Cenozoic passive margin series and which are tectonically overlain by the upper-plate-derived Coastal Range series. The restoration of cross sections yields a minimum shortening of ca. 120 km in the Eurasian passive margin series, on top of which the accreted material was initially sitting, already subducted below the Philippine Sea Plate. (2) Fieldwork and structural analyses indicate three deformation phases in the Yuli Belt. Based on cross sections and a review of available P-T-t data, we suspect that blueschist-facies units could have been emplaced on top of greenschist-facies metasedimentary units along a thrust during a first deformation phase D1. (3) We integrated new and published Raman-spectroscopic measurements on carbonaceous matter from metasedimentary successions across the Tailuko and Yuli Belts and combined these results with new cross sections. We suggest that the Yuli Belt was initially emplaced on top of lower-grade Paleogene successions. Later, the nappe succession was overprinted by E-vergent backfolding of the Central Range and contemporaneous backthrusting along the Shoufeng Fault, leading to the presently observed synformal structure of the Yuli Belt.",gnd:4020198-3 gnd:4695349-8 gnd:4020227-6 gnd:4132305-1 gnd:4059351-4 gnd:4038932-7
The secret of lobbying in China : who influences building energy efficiency standards?,"['What are the secrets of lobbying in China? How do companies influence technology standards in the building energy efficiency industry? More than 250 qualitative interviews with representatives of the industry, academia and the party state were conducted in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou between 2013 and 2015. As a result, the author has analysed business lobbying in four distinctive and exciting case studies and designed a research model to reliably measure lobbying influence and success by assessing the usefulness of lobbying targets, strategies and resources that were chosen by the industry. Therefore, this book closes an important gap in research into lobbying by focusing on influence rather than only on participation. It shows the ingredients for business lobbying but also the key determinants in assessing lobbying success. Some of the study’s findings allow conclusions about the influence of business lobbying in similar knowledge-intensive sectors and about the decision-making processes of the Chinese party state.

Synthesis of artificial building blocks for sortase-mediated ligation and their enzymatic linkage,"The enzyme Sortase A catalyzes the formation of a peptide bond between the recognition sequence LPXTG and an oligoglycine. While manifold ligations between proteins and various biomolecules, proteins and small synthetic molecules as well as proteins and surfaces have been reported, the aim of this thesis was to investigate the sortase-catalyzed linkage between artificial building blocks. Hence, this could pave the way for the use of sortase A for tasks from a chemical point of view and maybe even materials science. For the proof of concept, the studied systems were kept as simple as possible at first by choosing easily accessible silica NPs and commercially available polymers. These building blocks were functionalized with peptide motifs for sortase-mediated ligation.

Differential Rotation in Sun-like Stars from Surface Variability and Asteroseismology,"['In his PhD dissertation Martin Bo Nielsen performs observational studies of rotation in stars like the Sun. The interior rotation in stars is thought to be one of the driving mechanisms of stellar magnetic activity, but until now this mechanism was unconstrained by observational data. NASA’s Kepler space mission provides high-precision observations of Sun-like stars which allow rotation to be inferred using two independent methods: asteroseismology measures the rotation of the stellar interior, while the brightness variability caused by features on the stellar surface trace the rotation of its outermost layers. By combining these two techniques Martin Bo Nielsen was able to place upper limits on the variation of rotation with depth in five Sun-like stars.

Mass wasting and the Coriolis effect on asteroid Vesta,"This work investigates the influence of the Coriolis force on mass motion related to the Rheasilvia impact basin on asteroid (4) Vesta's southern hemisphere. The giant basin is 500km in diameter, with a centre which nearly coincides with the rotation axis of Vesta. The Rheasilvia basin partially overlaps an earlier, similarly large impact basin, Veneneia. Mass motion within and in the vicinity of the Rheasilvia basin includes slumping and landslides, which, primarily due to their small linear extents, have not been noticeably affected by the Coriolis force. However, a series of ridges related to the basin exhibit significant curvature, which may record the effect of the Coriolis force on the mass motion which generated them. In this thesis 32 of these curved ridges, in three geologically distinct regions, were examined. The mass motion velocities from which the ridge curvatures may have resulted during the crater modification stage were investigated. Velocity profiles were derived by fitting inertial circles along the curved ridges and considering both the current and past rotation states of Vesta. An iterative, statistical approach was used, whereby the radii of inertial circles were obtained through repeated fitting to triplets of points across the ridges. The most frequently found radius for each central point was then used for velocity derivation at that point. The results of the velocity analysis are strongly supportive of a Coriolis force origin for the curved ridges. Derived velocities (29.6 ± 24.6 m/s) generally agree well with previously published predictions from numerical simulations of mass motion during the impact process. Topographical features such as local slope gradient and mass deposition regions on the curved ridges also independently agree with regions in which the calculated mass motion accelerates or decelerates. Sections of constant acceleration, deceleration and constant velocity are found, showing that mass motion is being governed by varying conditions of topography, regolith structure and friction. Estimates of material properties such as the effective viscosities (1.9-9.0·10⁶ Pa·s) and coefficients of friction (0.02-0.81) are derived from the velocity profile information in these sections. From measured accelerations of mass motions on the crater wall, it is also shown that the crater walls must have been locally steeper at the time of the mass motion. Together with these novel insights into the state and behaviour of material moving during the modification stage of Rheasilvia's formation, this work represents the first time that the Coriolis Effect on mass motions during crater formation has been shown to result in diagnostic features preserved until today.",gnd:4350001-8 gnd:4259538-1 gnd:4169027-8 gnd:4038951-0

Sinapate ester metabolism in Brassica and Arabidopsis,"The accumulation of sinapate esters (SE) in organ- and tissue-specific patterns is considered a hallmark of Brassicaceae plants. Seeds of Arabidopsis and Brassica napus contain sinapine (sinapoylcholine) as major phenolic compound whereas the UV-shielding sinapoylmalate accumulates in epidermal cells. The accumulation kinetics of SE is based on transcriptional regulation of the enzymes UDP glucose:sinapate glucosyltransferase (SGT), sinapoylglucose:choline sinapoyltransferase (SCT), sinapoylglucose:malate sinapoyltransferase (SMT) and sinapine esterase (SCE). Enzymatic SGT activity is mediated by UDP glucosyltransferases of the UGT84A clade. In B. napus, the enzyme UGT84A9 is limiting for SE biosynthesis during seed development. Arabidopsis employs, besides the SGT homolog UGT84A2, three other hydroxycinnamate UGTs (UGT84A1, -A3, -A4) without pronounced specificity. In the allotetraploid genome of B. napus, UGT84A9 is represented by four loci of which UGT84A9a and -b are involved in SE biosynthesis. The sinapoyltransferases SMT and SCT were derived from hydrolases of the serine carboxypeptidase type (SCPs). Arabidopsis SMT adopted the functional elements of SCPs - catalytic triad, oxyanion hole and hydrogen bond network for substrate recognition - to catalyze glucose ester-dependent acyltransfer reactions. Sinapine esterase evolved by recruitment of lipase-like ancestors. To decrease the amount of antinutritive SE compounds in seeds of B. napus, targeted metabolic engineering was proven as the most efficient strategy. Silencing of UGT84A9 suppresses the biosyntheses of sinapine and related SE. Seed-specific overexpression of sinapine esterase BnSCE3 prevents sinapine accumulation by synchronization of biosynthesis and degradation. Combination of biosynthesis suppression with induced degradation of accumulating SE bears the potential to generate low sinapine B. napus lines.",gnd:4057699-1 gnd:4179774-7 gnd:4191450-8
Accessing active sites of molecular proton dynamics,"The unceasing impact of intense sunlight on earth constitutes a continuous source of energy fueling countless natural processes. On a molecular level, the energy contained in the electromagnetic radiation is transferred through photochemical processes into chemical or thermal energy. In the course of such processes, photo-excitations promote molecules into thermally inaccessible excited states. This induces adaptations of their molecular geometry according to the properties of the excited state. Decay processes towards energetically lower lying states in transient molecular geometries result in the formation of excited state relaxation pathways. The photo-chemical relaxation mechanisms depend on the studied system itself, the interactions with its chemical environment and the character of the involved states. This thesis focuses on systems in which photo-induced deprotonation processes occur at specific atomic sites.

CHLAMY1 binds specifically to (UG)?7-repeat sequences situated in the 3'-UTRs of several mRNAs such as nitrite reductase 1 (nii1). The role of the C1 subunit within the circadian system was characterized by silencing its gene by an RNAi. The expression level of C1 was silenced down to 25 - 85%. To show the influence of CHLAMY1 on circadian output, NII activities were measured. In wild-type, NII activity peaks around the beginning of subjective day. In the transgenic strain arrhythmicity was observed. Circadian phototaxis was chosen as a second output rhythm. In this case, arrhythmicity was observed immediately or in the first three days under constant conditions in transgenic lines. In addition to these results, a co-regulation between C1 and C3 subunits was found. These data indicate a central role of the C1 subunit in the circadian system of C. reinhardtii. It was also analyzed if the two subunits play a role in temperature integration. C1 was found to be hyper-phosphorylated at 18ʿC and hypo-phosphorylated at 28ʿC. The C3 expression level was found to be up-regulated at 18ʿC, which was shown to occur at the transcriptional level. The clock-relevant CASEIN KINASE1 (CK1) and Ser-/Thr-PROTEIN PHOSPHATASEs (PPs) were found to mediate the temperature dependent regulation of C1 and C3. The expression of CK1 was itself temperature controlled and increased at 28ʿC. In the long period clock mutant per1 temperature integration of both C1 and C3 was shown to be altered: a low phosphorylation level of C1 and a high expression level of C3 was observed at different temperatures. Altogether, the data suggest that a temperature controlled functional network of clock-relevant proteins exists in C. reinhardtii including C1, C3, CK1, PPs and PER1.",gnd:4178253-7 gnd:4147746-7 gnd:4078131-8
Novel diiron dichalcogenolato complexes : models for active site of [FeFe]-hydrogenase,"This dissertation focused on the synthesis and characterization of novel model complexes of the [FeFe]-hydrogenase active site containing diselenolato ligands. The substitution of one or two carbonyl groups of Fe2(?-Se2C3H5CH3)(CO)6 by PPh3, P(OMe)3 or dppe were investigated and leads to syntheses of several [FeFe]-hydrogenase models containing [2Fe2Se] core. Moreover, a series of oxetane-containing diiron dichalcogenolato complexes have been prepared. Diiron model complexes containing mixed (S, Se) or (S, Te) atoms have been also prepared.

Structural characterization of the metal-binding ligands S100A8/S100A9 and S100B of the receptor for advanced glycation end products,"['Zusammenfassung: S100B, S100A8 and S100A9 are members of the family of S100 proteins only found in vertebrates. They feature a four-α-helical structure with two Ca2+-binding EF-hand-loops per monomer forming dimers or higher oligomers. Homodimeric S100B is mainly expressed in astrocytes and is involved e. g. in neurite extension or apoptosis dependent on its concentration. Besides Ca2+, it also binds Zn2+ and Cu2+ with high affinity. In the C-terminus S100B contains a cysteine residue (Cys84) that is conserved in many S100 proteins. This Cys84 is located in helix IV of S100B and influences the neurotrophic function and binding affinity of S100B towards target molecules or Zn2+. Its structural impact was investigated by X-ray crystallographic analysis of the Cys84-to-Ser mutant (S100BMT). S100BMT was expressed, purified, and crystallized in the presence and absence of Zn2+. Crystals of S100BMT-Ca-Zn diffracted to a resolution of 1.2 Å, crystals of S100BMT-Ca to a resolution of 1.7 Å. Both structures were solved by molecular replacement. Like in wild-type S100B, Zn2+ is coordinated tetrahedrally by residues His15 and His25 of one subunit and His85 and Glu89 from the second subunit. Two additional unspecific Zn2+ sites were observed in S100BMT-Ca-Zn, where Zn2+ is coordinated by His42 and by an acetate from the crystallization buffer. Superposition of the structures of wild-type S100B and S100BMT revealed that the C-terminal helix IV of S100BMT-Ca was shortened by six residues. Zn2+ binding to S100BMT reversed the effect of the mutation and stabilized full-length helix IV. Thus, Cys84 is required for the stabilization of helix IV in S100B. S100A8 and S100A9 are highly expressed by monocytes and neutrophils and secreted at sites of pathogenic invasion and inflammation. Both proteins act in their heteromeric form as chemokines or cytokines and activate the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) of the innate immunity. The quinoline-3-carboxamide compound ABR-215757 and the monoclonal antibody Fab43/8 block the interaction of S100A9 with these receptors. They therefore can inhibit specifically the activation of signaling pathways leading to pathologies associated with RAGE and TLR-4. To get detailed insight into the binding mechanism of S100A9 with its inhibitors, S100A9 was expressed and purified. Moreover, a complex of S100A9 and Fab43/8 was successfully purified. S100A9 was crystallized and crystals w ...', 'Zusammenfassung: S100B, S100A8 und S100A9 gehören zur Familie der S100-Proteine, welche nur in Vertebraten vorkommen. Gemeinsames Merkmal dieser Proteine ist ihre Struktur mit vier α-Helices und zwei Ca2+-bindenden EF-Händen je Monomer. S100-Proteine bilden Dimere oder höhere Oligomere. Das Homodimer S100B wird hauptsächlich in Astrozyten exprimiert und reguliert im ZNS Wachstum von Neuriten oder Apoptose von Neuronen, abhängig von der Konzentration dieses Proteins. Neben Ca2+ bindet S100B auch Zn2+ und Cu2+ mit hoher Affinität. S100B enthält im C-Terminus ein hochkonserviertes Cystein (Cys84), welches für die Funktion von S100B eine zentrale Rolle zu spielen scheint. Cys84 liegt in Helix IV von S100B und beeinflusst die Bindung von Zn2+, die Bindung von S100B-regulierten Zielproteinen und dessen neurotrophe Funktion. Welche strukturelle Rolle dieses Cys84 für S100B spielt, wurde hier mittels Röntgenstrukturanalyse der Cys84-Ser84-Mutante von S100B (S100BMT) kristallographisch untersucht. Hierfür wurde S100BMT exprimiert, isoliert und in Anwesenheit und Abwesenheit von Zn2+ kristallisiert. Kristalle von S100BMT-Ca-Zn beugten die Röntgenstrahlung bis zu einer Auflösung von 1.2 Å, S100BMT-Ca-Kristalle bis zu einer Auslösung von 1.7 Å. Beide Strukturen wurden durch die Methode des Molekularen Ersatzes gelöst. Wie im Wildtyp-Protein war auch in S100BMT-Ca-Zn das Zn2+ tetrahedral durch die Reste His15 und His25 der einen Untereinheit und durch His85 und Glu89 der zweiten Untereinheit des Homodimers koordiniert. His42 und ein Azetat des Kristallisationspuffers bildeten zwei weitere unspezifische Zn2+-Bindestellen in S100BMT-Ca-Zn. Strukturüberlagerungen von S100BWT-Ca und S100BMT-Ca zeigten in der Struktur von S100BMT-Ca eine Verkürzung der C-terminalen Helix IV um sechs Reste. Diese Strukturänderung wurde durch die Bindung von Zn2+ wieder aufgehoben, wie die Struktur von S100BMT-Ca-Zn zeigte. Cys84 ist somit essentiell für die Stabilisierung von Helix IV in S100B. S100A8 und S100A9 werden von Monozyten und Neutrophilen exprimiert und an Entzündungsherden sowie bei der Invasion verschiedener Pathogene sekretiert.

Compact Lie group actions on contact manifolds,"The main result in this thesis is the classification of SO(3)-actions on contact 5-manifolds. Using properties of the moment map, one can reduce the manifold to a 3-dimensional contact manifold with an S^1-action. This works everywhere outside of the singular orbits. For the singular orbits three models can be given that describe all possible cases. The 5-manifold is then obtained by gluing the singular set onto the 3-dimensional S^1-manifold in a compatible way. As it is well-known, S^1-bundles over a closed surface are classified by an integer called the Euler number. A similar invariant can be recovered in our 3-dimensional setting.

Model-driven performance measurement and assessment with relational traces,"['Model Driven Engineering is an emerging approach in software development which argues using models as primary software artifacts. The models can vary from prescriptive ones specified in Domain Specific Modeling Languages (DSMLs), for the domain specific software development (e.g. Graphical User Interfaces DSML), to descriptive models for analysis, such as queuing networks and Petri-nets. The main benefit of such approach is that it reduces the time and effort spent in implementation by transforming the domain specific prescriptive models to the code. Furthermore, performance characteristics of the implementation can be predicted during the design phase with usage of transformation of domain specific constructs to formal mathematical models. For software performance, as an important software Quality of Service attribute, several approaches for prediction exist in MDE. However, MDE still lacks a systematic approach for performance measurement and metrics assessment. This thesis presents MoDePeMART, an approach for Model Driven Performance Measurement and Assessment with Relational Traces. The approach suggests declarative specification of performance metrics in a domain-specific language and the usage of relational databases for storage and metric computation. The approach is evaluated with the implementation of a UML Profile for UML Class and State diagrams and transformations from the profile to a commercial relational database management system. <engl.>', 'Model Driven Engineering (MDE) ist eine neue Vorgehensweise in der Software-Entwicklung, die Modelle als primäre Software-Artefakte verwendet.

Cytokinins shape plant-herbivore interactions in Nicotiana attenuata,"Cytokinins (CK), a group of plant hormones, are well known for their functions in growth and development as well as in environmental interactions. Except for some prominent examples like “green islands” and leaf‐galls caused by endophytic insects via CK, only little is known about the function of CK in plant‐insect interaction. In my thesis I have studied the role of CK in the ecological model plant Nicotiana attenuata and two of its most abundant specialized free living herbivores, the larvae of the tobacco hawkmoth Manduca sexta as well as the mirid bug Tupiocoris notatus. I studied the effect of herbivory on CK levels and CK pathway and used transgenic plants with altered CK biosynthesis or perception to demonstrate the effect of CK on expression of herbivore induced defenses (HID). HID follow a developmentally dependent concentration‐gradient predicted by the “Optimal Defense Theory”: High concentrations of HID in young leaves with a higher value for the plants reproductive success, and low levels in old leaves. We observed that CK follow the same gradient and that increasing CK levels in old leaves was sufficient to increase HID levels in old leaves to levels comparable to young leaves. However, this increase in HID did not improve the plants resistance against herbivory. This is possibly due to CK simultaneously inhibiting senesce processes which might be an important part of a plants defense against specialized herbivores. T. notatus seems capable to actively manipulate these senescence processes via CK and stabilize nutrient levels in attacked leaves. With 15N labeled plants we could prove that T. notatus transfers the CK N6‐isopentenyladenine to its hostplant via its oral secretions. A phenomenon so far not described for free living insects. Based on my results I suggest that the role of CK goes far beyond the known cases of endophytes and that CK have rather a key role in the interaction of plants and insects.",gnd:4205701-2

From a scientific understanding of matter, such forms of touching are often to be understood as metaphors or analogies. From the history of the present study, there was the presumption that concrete perceptions are associated with those metaphors and analogies. The study then explored the question of how touch can be understood in a broad sense as moments of experiences and can be explored in a sociological way. As a result, an alternative concept of touch is developed, which can also capture a touch through looks or through the observation of behavior as concrete experiences within a social practice.

Design and optimization of the grating monochromator for soft X-ray self-seeding FELs,"The emergence of Free Electron Lasers (FEL) as a fourth generation of light sources is a breakthrough. FELs operating in the X-ray range (XFEL) allow one to carry out completely new experiments that probably most of the natural sciences would benefit. Self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE) is the baseline FEL operation mode: the radiation pulse starts as a spontaneous emission from the electron bunch and is being amplified during an FEL process until it reaches saturation. The SASE FEL radiation usually has poor properties in terms of a spectral bandwidth or, on the other side, longitudinal coherence. Self-seeding is a promising approach to narrow the SASE bandwidth of XFELs significantly in order to produce nearly transformlimited pulses. It is achieved by the radiation pulse monochromatization in the middle of an FEL amplification process. Following the successful demonstration of the self-seeding setup in the hard X-ray range at the LCLS, there is a need for a self-seeding extension into the soft X-ray range. Here a numerical method to simulate the soft X-ray self seeding (SXRSS) monochromator performance is presented. It allows one to perform start-to-end self-seeded FEL simulations along with (in our case) GENESIS simulation code. Based on this method, the performance of the LCLS self-seeded operation was simulated showing a good agreement with an experiment. Also the SXRSS monochromator design developed in SLAC was adapted for the SASE3 type undulator beamline at the European XFEL. The optical system was studied using Gaussian beam optics, wave optics propagation method and ray tracing to evaluate the performance of the monochromator itself. Wave optics analysis takes into account the actual beam wavefront of the radiation from the coherent FEL source, third order aberrations and height errors from each optical element. The monochromator design is based on a toroidal VLS grating working at a fixed incidence angle mounting without both entrance and exit slits. It is optimized for the spectral range of 300 − 1200 eV providing resolving power above 7000. The proposed monochromator is composed of three mirrors and the grating. Start-to-end simulation as a case study of the selfseeded European XFEL performance with a proposed SXRSS monochromator is presented. It shows that the laser pulse power reaches a TW-level with its spectral density about eighty times higher than that of the conventional SASE pulse at saturation.",gnd:4323946-8 gnd:4765228-7

It analyzes how information from point-of-sale scanner systems can be used to improve inventory decisions, and develops a data-driven approach that integrates demand forecasting and inventory management for perishable products, while taking unobservable lost sales and substitution into account in out-of-stock situations. Using linear programming, a new inventory function that reflects the causal relationship between demand and external factors such as price and weather is proposed. The book subsequently demonstrates the benefits of this new approach in numerical studies that utilize real data collected at a large European retail chain. Furthermore, the book derives an optimal inventory policy for a multi-product setting in which the decision-maker faces an aggregated service level target, and analyzes whether the decision-maker is subject to behavioral biases based on real data for bakery products.",gnd:4423366-8 gnd:4034878-7 gnd:4041036-5 gnd:4358095-6
Credit and liquidity risk in Lévy asset price models,"Zusammenfassung: In this thesis, we present a new kind of asset price model. Credit risk considerations and new developments in the area of liquidity risk modelling are taken into account.In Chapter 1, essential mathematical tools, such as stochastic processes and dependence modelling, are reviewed.Chapter 2 presents a new asset price model, which is an enhancement of the exponential Levy model. The possibility of default is modelled by a single jump to zero, whereby higher probabilities for this event lead to lower asset prices. Explicit valuation formulas for European options are established by using the Fourier valuation method. The formulas can numerically be computed fast and thus allow to calibrate the model to market data.On illiquid markets, the law of one price no longer prevails and the costs of holding unhedgeable risks have to be considered. This issue is incorporated in the Two Price Theory of Cherny and Madan (2010) which is discussed and applied to the considered asset price model in Chapter 3 of this thesis",gnd:4463623-4 gnd:4017214-4

Decomposition and stability of multifronts and multipulses,In this thesis we consider time dependent reaction diffusion systems in one space dimension that have multiple pulse or front solutions. We develop a new numerical method that decomposes the solutions into their single pulses or fronts and in addition one computes the speeds and the positions of the single pulses and fronts. We show that the method is numerically feasible and prove stability results for the multiple pulse and front solutions if the distance of the pulses or fronts is sufficiently large and they interact only through their small tails.,gnd:4128130-5 gnd:4323967-5

Determination of the methane budget of the Amazon region utilizing airborne methane observations in combination with atmospheric transport and vegetation modeling,"The Amazon basin is an important player in the global methane cycle. Objectives of this work are to establish a forward and inverse modelling framework on regional scale and to determine the methane budget in the Amazon region. Within the BARCA project (Balanço Atmosférico Regional de Carbono na Amazônia) to airborne measurement campaigns were conducted, one in November 2008 and one in May 2009. The analysis of the methane observations confirms that the Amazon basin is a strong source of methane. The majority of the emissions is found to have biogenic origin, i.e. from wetlands. A comparison of five global methane inversions shows the advantage of using satellite observations in inversion systems. The WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) Greenhouse Gas model was developed to perform high-resolution simulations of the atmospheric methane distribution in the Amazon region. The newly written code is available within the official WRF-Chem version 3.4 release. Simulations for the two months of the BARCA campaigns with two different wetland models and three different wetland maps were conducted with the WRF Greenhouse Gas model. The comparison to observations indicates that the choice of the wetland map is more important than the choice of the wetland model for a comparison to aircraft observations. Flights with a good representation of the atmospheric transport in the model show a higher correlation between observations and simulations. The two-step regional inversion scheme TM3-STILT was applied to the Amazon region for the year 2009 using observations from the 35 m high TT34 tower. The inversion shows improvements in the representation of the seasonal cycle of the methane emissions in the Amazon basin. However, the determination of the methane budget in the Amazon basin is still highly uncertain.",gnd:4286529-3

However, due to demographic changes and rising labor costs, the high growth phase of China is almost coming to an end. An innovation-driven development pattern has settled upon as the target of China’s government. The core question of the work is: Which factors of innovation systems, market structure and state ownership influence the innovation performance of China? With respect to the innovation performance of provinces, we find that regional innovation systems play an essential role. Market-oriented institutional arrangements increase innovation performance. At the industrial level, there is an inverted-U relationship between market concentration and innovation output. As for the effect of ownership relationship, the impact of state ownership on innovation performance depends on a number of conditions. More precisely, state control of firms has a negative impact on innovation output in particular in China’s Northeast region and in mid- and high-tech sectors whereas under other circumstances it does either not matter or can even exert a positive influence.', 'Chinas Transformation hat fast alle Gebiete der chinesischen Wirtschaft verändert.

New approaches to locally adaptive nonparametric estimation and inference,"Abstract: This thesis is concerned with new approaches to locally adaptive estimation and inference. More specifically, this work focusses on estimation and inference related to probability densities in the framework of nonparametric statistics. Indeed, it investigates both on adaptation to lowest density regions and on locally adaptive confidence bands. The two distinct topics are presented in two self-contained chapters. <br>In the first chapter, a scheme for locally adaptive bandwidth selection is proposed which sensitively shrinks the bandwidth of a kernel estimator at lowest density regions, such as the support boundary, which are unknown to the statistician. In case of a Hölder continuous density, this locally minimax-optimal bandwidth is shown to be smaller than the usual rate, even in case of homogeneous smoothness. A new type of risk bound with respect to a density-dependent standardized loss of this estimator is established. This bound is fully non-asymptotic and allows to deduce convergence rates at lowest density regions that can be substantially faster than n^(-1/2). It is complemented by a weighted minimax lower bound which splits into two regimes depending on the value of the density. The new estimator adapts into the second regime, and it is shown that simultaneous adaptation into the fastest regime is not possible in principle as long as the Hölder exponent is unknown. Consequences on plug-in rules for support recovery  are worked out in detail. In contrast to those with classical density estimators, the plug-in rules based on the new construction are minimax-optimal, up to some logarithmic factor. <br>In the second chapter, we develop honest and locally adaptive confidence bands for probability densities. They provide substantially improved confidence statements in case of inhomogeneous smoothness, and are easily implemented and visualized. The thesis contributes conceptual work on locally adaptive inference as a straightforward modification of the global setting imposes severe obstacles for statistical purposes. We introduce a statistical notion of local Hölder regularity and prove a correspondingly strong version of local adaptivity. We substantially relax the straightforward localization of the self-similarity condition in order not to rule out prototypical densities. The set of densities permanently excluded from the consideration is shown to be pathological in a mathematically rigorous sense.

Fiscal policy and environmental welfare : modelling interjurisdictional competition,"In this innovative book the author examines the link between environmental, trade and industrial policies within an interregional setting. He models how regional governments, using tax rates on real capital and pollutant emissions, determine policies to favour their residents in terms of the provision of public goods and reduction in environmental degradation. Regions or countries engage in competition for mobile capital in a world where production causes pollution and tax revenues are required to finance public goods. In Fiscal Policy and Environmental Welfare the author considers the efficiency consequences when governments act strategically and seek to manage trade, capital flows and emissions. Using formal models, which extend and modify existing literature, the author demonstrates that interjurisdictional competition typically leads to inefficiencies. He argues that although interjurisdictional competition may lead to the overprovision of public goods and to an inefficiently high environmental quality, often the opposite seems to occur.

Analysis of partial order reduction techniques for automated planning,"Abstract: Automated planning is an area of Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) that is closely related to decision making. Given a planning problem, which is described as an initial state (i.e., a start conﬁguration of the problem), a set of actions, and a goal description, a planning algorithm is concerned with ﬁnding a sequence of actions or a strategy for achieving the goal conditions from the initial state. Planning, in all its variations, is a hard problem. Classical planning is one of the simplest forms of planning. Despite its simplicity, it is still computationally intractable. Therefore, planning problems cannot be solved by brute-force algorithms, but rather by goal-directed algorithms that tackle the complexity of planning. Planning as heuristic search is a prominent technique that has been considered in the area of automated planning. However, recent research has shown that planning as heuristic search needs the aid of orthogonal techniques. Partial order reduction is a well-known and reliable approach that has originally been introduced in the area of computer aided veriﬁcation to tackle the state explosion problem. It is usually used for explicit state-space search to reduce the size of the generated state space. There are two categories of partial order reduction techniques: State reduction and transition reduction techniques. The former are specialized to prune some states that are guaranteed to be uncritical for reaching some ﬁnal states (e.g., goal states in planning), while the latter are designed to prune only redundant states. Later, new partial order reduction techniques have been proposed for optimal planning algorithms. However, the formal relationships between the previous and later techniques were unclear, and furthermore, some of the novel techniques were faulty. In the context of classical planning, we investigate two variants of a powerful state reduction technique from the area of model checking, called stubborn sets. Furthermore, we propose a new deﬁnition of stubborn sets for Fully Observable Non-Deterministic planning (FOND). For classical planning, we show that stubborn sets are completeness and optimality preserving, whereas for FOND planning, we show that they are at least completeness preserving. In addition, we compare between stubborn sets and previous partial order reduction techniques proposed for optimal planning. Moreover, we study a transition reduction technique from the area of model checking, called sleep  ...",gnd:4001183-5 gnd:4033447-8 gnd:4113446-1

Mesoscopic structure through the prism of transverse relaxation,"Zusammenfassung: In standard MR images the contrast between different tissues is primarily determined via their distinctive relaxation rates resulting from differences in the molecular dipole-dipole interactions. In addition, the transverse relaxation in biological tissue is influenced by the heterogeneous magnetic susceptibility of tissues on the mesoscopic scale of cells and capillaries. When exposed to a strong main field this results in heterogeneous magnetic structures that cause an additional loss of coherence of individual spin signals leading to a dephasing of the overall MR signal, so-called (transverse) mesoscopic relaxation. These structures are smaller than the typical MR imaging resolution achievable in humans and cannot be investigated directly. The signal acquired from a volume element is a huge average over the individual spins diffusing through the heterogeneous substructure.In this context, this thesis analyzes the statistical properties of structural organization in magnetically heterogeneous media that survive the massive signal averaging and that are obtainable from the measurable MR signal. Considered is the statistical organization of magnetic susceptibility inclusions that induce a heterogeneous magnetic field on the mesoscopic scale. In such an environment the nuclear spins rotate at various different Larmor frequencies, which leads to an overall frequency shift and additional dephasing, the mesoscopic relaxation as introduced above, of the MR signal",gnd:4182335-7 gnd:4168567-2 gnd:4120806-7 gnd:4280799-2 gnd:4240945-7 gnd:4075421-2

In contrast to trivial insulators, topological insulators possess conducting boundary states which cross the bulk energy gap that separates the highest occupied electronic band from the lowest unoccupied band. The materials used in this thesis are three-dimensional topological insulators with time-reversal symmetry. Their associated helical surface states are protected against elastic backscattering by Kramers degeneracy. The unique properties of the helical surface states can be utilized to generate spin-polarized currents at the surface of topological insulators and to control their propagation direction. This makes them a promising material class for the field of spintronics. Here, we perform photocurrent scans of topological insulator Hall bar and nanowire devices. From these measurements, we obtained two-dimensional maps of the polarization-independent and helicity-dependent components of the photocurrents. We find that the polarization-independent component is dominated by the Seebeck effect and thus driven by thermoelectric currents. On the other hand, the helicity-dependent component is driven by the spin-polarized currents that emerge from the topologically non-trivial helical surface states via the circular photogalvanic effect.

Automated dual-tip scanning near-field optical microscope for investigation of nanophotonic systems,"The main goal of this dissertation was to realize a fully automated and robust dual-tip scanning near-field optical microscope (SNOM) and demonstrate its capabilities to characterize nanophotonic systems. The dual-tip SNOM accesses optical information not simply attained with other super-resolution microscopy techniques. This work thoroughly explained the implementation of a collision prevention scheme and the realization of the fully automated dual-tip SNOM, in which the detection tip automatically scans the entire area surrounding the excitation tip without collision. After successfully implementing the automated dual-tip SNOM, the setup was utilized to measure the near-field of different photonic materials. First, the dual-tip SNOM was used to explore the polarization characteristic of the emission from the bent fiber aperture tip through exciting surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) on an air-gold interface. Another unique application of the dual-tip SNOM is to excite the edge or corner of a photonic system locally. The automated detection tip was used to map a complex near-field pattern due to the excited SPPs and reflected SPPs from the edges of the truncated triangular gold platelet. The most distinguished capability of the automated dual-tip SNOM shown in this thesis is spectral- and spatial-dependent near-field measurements of a nanodisk metasurface as a nanostructured sample. In spectral-dependent near-field measurements, the excitation tip illuminated the silicon metasurface at different wavelengths. In spatial-dependence near-field measurements, the fixed excitation wavelength was used to measure the position-dependent near-field intensities when the metasurface was displaced relative to the excitation tip. It was demonstrated that the integrated measured near-field intensities by the detection tip could be related to the metasurface's partial local density of optical states at the excitation tip's position.",gnd:4312216-4 gnd:1240784643 gnd:4330329-8
Development of adsorbent coatings on thermal conductive structures for adsorption processes,"Abstract: The earth as we know it can only continue to exist if humanity finds a way to switch to a sustainable use of energy and resources. This work contributes to the research carried out to achieve this goal by improving the coating of adsorptive materials. These are used in heat transformation and drying processes that allow for efficient temperature and humidity control in buildings. A central component of these adsorptive coatings is the binder that acts as “glue” in the manufacturing of the coating. In this work the methods to evaluate binder performance regarding their thermal stability under the process conditions, their mechanical stability and their influence on the adsorptive properties of the coating were established. The coatings have to meet special requirements due to the thermal stresses and low pressure atmosphere they experience in these applications. A selection of silicone binders was then characterized with the established tests according to these requirements. Additionally a selection of inorganic binders was investigated because they allow for the use of high desorption temperatures and thus a high energy efficiency of the process. Out of these binders Silres® MP50E emerged as the most promising one due to very good adsorptive properties of the coating, its good temperature stability and ease of use. While some of the inorganic binders showed very good adsorptive properties and temperature stability the mechanical stability of all inorganic binders was not sufficient for their use in adsorption heat transformation technology. This is the first time that a broad selection of binders was evaluated with regards to adsorptive coatings and the results published in literature. With a suitable binder identified, the next step was to optimize the coating of the heat exchangers in order to work out how to manufacture the most efficient and powerful heat exchangers. Samples with different coating thicknesses were manufactured in small scale and full scale and their adsorption behavior was characterized. It could be shown for the first time that it is possible to increase energy efficiency by improving the mass ration of adsorber to coating and increase the delivered power at the same time. This was shown for small and full scale samples. It was shown that under the corresponding conditions the heat transfer from the coating layer to the adsorber metal substrate is the limiting step in the process.

Fluid-structur-interaction simulations of non-Newtonian fluids interacting with thin elastic koiter shells,"Abstract: In this thesis we consider the numerical treatment of fluid-structure interaction prob- lems. We focus on incompressible non-Newtonian fluids interacting with thin elastic Koiter shells. In this thesis we develop tools, which are necessary for the numerical simulation of fluid-structure interaction problems. We start with a short introduc- tion into the mathematical description of an incompressible non-Newtonian fluids and the Koiter shell model. The mathematical model consists of the generalized incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, where the extra stress tensor is assumed to have a (p, δ)-structure, and the equation for a thin elastic Koiter shell model. Both equations are coupled by the assumption of continuous velocities, continuous displacements and the continuity of stresses. The Arbitrary Lagrangian-Euelerian (ALE) approach is used in order to take into account the movement of the com- putational domain. The fluid-structure interaction model is presented in its nat- ural framework and in the ALE framework. For non-Newtonian fluids we present the discretization on moving domains using the Discontinuous Galerkin methods. Three different Discontinuous Galerkin methods will be presented, that are designed to solve numerically accurate problems where the extra stress tensor has a (p, δ)- structure. We present series of experiments including numerical error analysis, com- parison of the proposed numerical schemes in terms of accuracy and efficiency. For the thin elastic Koiter shell model, we present the discretization using the so-called Surface-Finite-Element method and analyse the approximation quality in numerical experiments. Finally, we describe two different types of discrete coupling strategies, a direct approach which uses nested sub-iterations and the so-called kinematic cou- pling approach. Numerical analysis and extensive experimental study for standard geometries confirm reliability and accuracy of the proposed schemes in order to ap- proximate fluid-structure interaction problems of non-Newtonian fluids interacting with thin elastic structures",gnd:4077970-1 gnd:4314754-9
Nanomechanics in van der Waals Heterostructures,"['Micro/nano-mechanical systems are a crucial part of the modern world providing a plethora of sensing and actuation functionalities used in everything from the largest cargo ships to the smallest hand-held electronics; from the most advanced scientific and medical equipment to the simplest household items. Over the past few decades, the processes used to produce these devices have improved, supporting dramatic reductions in size, but there are fundamental limits to this trend that require a new production paradigm. The 2004 discovery of graphene ushered in a new era of condensed matter physics research, that of two-dimensional materials. Being only a few atomic layers thick, this new class of materials exhibit unprecedented mechanical strength and flexibility and can couple to electric, magnetic and optical signals. Additionally, they can be combined to form van der Waals heterostructures in an almost limitless number of ways. They are thus ideal candidates to reduce the size and extend the capabilities of traditional micro/nano-mechanical systems and are poised to redefine the technological sphere. This thesis attempts to develop the framework and protocols required to produce and characterise micro/nano-mechanical devices made from two-dimensional materials. Graphene and its insulating analogue, hexagonal boron nitride, are the most widely studied materials and their heterostructures are used as the test-bed for potential device architectures and capabilities.

Climate change impacts on agricultural vegetation in sub-Saharan Africa,"Agriculture is one of the most important human activities providing food and more agricultural goods for seven billion people around the world and is of special importance in sub-Saharan Africa. The majority of people depends on the agricultural sector for their livelihoods and will suffer from negative climate change impacts on agriculture until the middle and end of the 21st century, even more if weak governments, economic crises or violent conflicts endanger the countries’ food security. The impact of temperature increases and changing precipitation patterns on agricultural vegetation motivated this thesis in the first place. Analyzing the potentials of reducing negative climate change impacts by adapting crop management to changing climate is a second objective of the thesis. As a precondition for simulating climate change impacts on agricultural crops with a global crop model first the timing of sowing in the tropics was improved and validated as this is an important factor determining the length and timing of the crops´ development phases, the occurrence of water stress and final crop yield. Crop yields are projected to decline in most regions which is evident from the results of this thesis, but the uncertainties that exist in climate projections and in the efficiency of adaptation options because of political, economical or institutional obstacles have to be considered. The effect of temperature increases and changing precipitation patterns on crop yields can be analyzed separately and varies in space across the continent. Southern Africa is clearly the region most susceptible to climate change, especially to precipitation changes. The Sahel north of 13° N and parts of Eastern Africa with short growing seasons below 120 days and limited wet season precipitation of less than 500 mm are also vulnerable to precipitation changes while in most other part of East and Central Africa, in contrast, the effect of temperature increase on crops overbalances the precipitation effect and is most pronounced in a band stretching from Angola to Ethiopia in the 2060s. The results of this thesis confirm the findings from previous studies on the magnitude of climate change impact on crops in sub-Saharan Africa but beyond that helps to understand the drivers of these changes and the potential of certain management strategies for adaptation in more detail. Crop yield changes depend on the initial growing conditions, on the magnitude of climate change, and on the crop, cropping system and adaptive capacity of African farmers which is only now evident from this comprehensive study for sub-Saharan Africa. Furthermore this study improves the representation of tropical cropping systems in a global crop model and considers the major food crops cultivated in sub-Saharan Africa and climate change impacts throughout the continent.",gnd:4164199-1 gnd:4045547-6
Layered Two-Dimensional Heterostructures and Their Tunneling Characteristics,"This thesis demonstrates that layered heterostructures of two-dimensional crystals graphene, hexagonal boron nitride, and transition metal dichalcogenides provide new and interesting interlayer transport phenomena. Low-energy electron microscopy is employed to study the surface of atomically thin WSe2 prepared by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition on epitaxial graphene substrates, and a method for unambiguously measuring the number of atomic layers is presented. Using very low-energy electrons to probe the surface of similar heterostructures, a relationship between extracted work function differences from the layers and the nature of the electrical contact between them is revealed. An extension of this analysis is applied to surface studies of MoSe2 prepared by molecular beam epitaxy on epitaxial graphene. A large work function difference is measured between the MoSe2 and graphene, and a model is provided which suggests that this observation results from an exceptional defect density in the MoSe2 film.

Direct laser bonding of transparent materials using ultrashort laser pulses at high repetition rates,"Transparent materials surround us everywhere in our daily life. Especially glass has a dominant role due to its excellent optical, mechanical and chemical properties. For the processing of glass numerous techniques are well known, some of them are more than several hundred years old. In contrast, the reliable and stable bonding of two different glasses is still a demanding problem. Most of the developed glass bonding techniques are adapted from well known silicon waver techniques [1, 2]. All the established methods e.g. optical contacting, direct bonding or anodic bonding exhibit certain disadvantages as these methods were not designed for the bonding of glasses [3, 4]. For example, optical contacting - were two ultraclean glass samples are pressed together and adhere due to the van der Waals forces between their surface atoms - yields only weak bonds. Alternatively, laser pulses can be used to weld the glass samples together. Commonly high average power cw-lasers are used for laser welding. However for the absorption of cwlaser radiation an opaque material is required. Alternatively, ultrashort laser pulses have proven to be a powerful tool for the processing of transparent materials within the last two decades. The extremely short pulse duration allow nonlinear processes that fundamentally differ from traditional light-matter interaction mechanisms. Nonlinear absorption induced by ultrashort pulses leads to an extremely non-equilibrium state in a confined volume resulting in a variety of different material modifications [5, 6]. Due to the highly localized energy deposition machining of sub micron features and full three dimensional processing of transparent materials become feasible [5, 7]. In fused silica three different types of modifications can be induced: isotropic and anisotropic index changes [5, 6, 8, 9, 10] and the generation of small cavities [11, 12].

The reverse of urban planning : Towards a 20th century history of informal urbanization in Europe and its origins in Madrid and Paris (1850-1940),"The objective of this thesis was to understand the 20th-century history of informal urbanisation in Europe and its origins in Madrid and Paris. The concept of informal urbanisation was employed to refer to the process of developing shacks and precarious single-family housing areas that were not planned by the public powers and were considered to be substandard because of their below-average materials and social characteristics. Our main hypothesis was that despite being a phenomenon with ancient roots, informal urbanisation emerged as a public problem and was subsequently prohibited in connection with another historical process occurred: the birth of contemporary urban planning. Therefore, its transformation into a deviant and illegal urban growth mechanism would have been a pan-European process occurring at the same pace that urban planning developed during the first decades of the 20th century.  Analysing the 20th-century history of informal urbanisation in Europe was an ambitious task that required using a large number of sources. To contend with this issue, this thesis combined two main methods: historiographical research about informal urbanisation in Europe and archival research of two case studies, Madrid and Paris, to make the account more precise by analysing primary sources of the subject. Our research of these informal areas, which were produced mainly through poor private allotments and housing developed on land squats, revealed two key moments of explosive growth across Europe: the 1920s and 1960s. The near disappearance of informal urbanisation throughout the continent seemed to be a consequence not of the historical development of urban planning—which was commonly transgressed and bypassed—but of the exacerbation of global economic inequalities, permitting the development of a geography of privilege in Europe. Concerning the cases of Paris and Madrid, the origins of informal urbanisation—that is, the moment the issue started to be problematised—seemed to occur in the second half of the 19th century, when a number of hygienic norms and surveillance devices began to control housing characteristics. From that moment onwards, informal urbanisation areas formed peripheral belts in both cities. This growth became the object of an illegalisation process of which we have identified three phases: (i) the unregulated development of the phenomenon during the second half of the 20th century, (ii) the institutional production of “exception regulations” to permit a controlled development of substandard housing in the peripheral fringes of both cities, and (iii) the synchronic prohibition of informal urbanisation in the 1920s and its illegal reproduction.",gnd:4063234-9 gnd:4056754-0 gnd:4447176-2

At the boundary of an anomalous Floquet topological insulator, topologically protected transport occurs even though all of the Floquet bands are topologically trivial. This is in stark contrast to ordinary topological insulators of both static and Floquet type, where the topological invariants of the bulk bands completely determine the chiral boundary states via the bulk-boundary correspondence.  In anomalous Floquet topological insulators, the boundary states are instead characterized by bulk invariants that account for the full dynamical evolution of the Floquet system. Here, we explore the interplay between topology, symmetry, and non-Hermiticity in two-dimensional anomalous Floquet topological insulators. The central results of this exploration are (i) new expressions for the topological invariants of symmetry-protected anomalous Floquet topological phases which can be efficiently computed numerically, (ii) the construction of a universal driving protocol for symmetry-protected anomalous Floquet topological phases and its experimental implementation in photonic waveguide lattices, (iii) the discovery of non-Hermitian boundary state engineering which provides unprecedented possibilities to control and manipulate the topological transport of anomalous Floquet topological insulators.']",gnd:4159617-1 gnd:1035519526 gnd:4058724-1 gnd:4317056-0
"Structural style and long-term slip rates in the Zagros Fold-Thrust Belt (Kurdistan Region of Iraq) derived from structural modeling, luminescence dating of river terraces and tectonic geomorphology","The Zagros Mountain Front Flexure is one of these major boundaries and forms a prominent topographic and structural step in the frontal part of the Zagros Belt. This study focuses on the Mountain Front Flexure in Kurdistan Region of Iraq. the structural style at depth is constrained from the balanced cross-section and structural forward modeling. The long-term fault slip rates are calculated for several structure from the uplifted river terraces on the banks of the Greater Zab River. The landscape maturity of several frontal anticlines was assessed to estimate difference in their relative uplift time using geomorphic indices and landscape evolution modeling. The results show that the structural evolution is represented by a multi-stage deformation. The thin-skinned deformation above the Triassic detachment was evolved first. Then, a basement thrust was evolved in the deformation and the basement thrusting is responsible for the structural step across the Mountain Front Flexure. The faults in the area are active. The basement fault below the Zagros Mountain Front Fault accommodates about 1.46±0.60 mm a-1 of slip, while a more external basement fault further to the SW accommodates less than 0.41±0.16 mm a-1. Horizontal slip rates related to detachment folding of Safin and Sarta anticlines within the Zagros Foothills are 0.40±0.10 and 1.24±0.36 mm a-1, respectively. There is difference in the landscape maturity of the frontal anticlines, and their relative uplift time. The resulting interpretation from the landscape maturity is that Akre Anticline was the first to uplift among the studied anticlines, followed by Perat Anticline and Harir Anticline. It can be inferred that uplift of the Akre and Perat anticlines started 160–200 and 80–100 kyr, respectively, before that of the Harir Anticline.",gnd:4154916-8 gnd:4442915-0 gnd:4186632-0 gnd:4705025-1 gnd:4317123-0 gnd:4184795-7 gnd:4294483-1 gnd:4142676-9 gnd:4020212-4

Thus, this dissertation aimed to study ant-plant mutualism on a molecular level, with a focus on defense-related metabolism. Because most myrmecophytes are trees, the Neotropical ant-plant Tococa quadrialata as a fast growing shrub was chosen as a model species to explore the consequences of the mutualism and to characterize the response of myrmecophytes to herbivory in detail, combining field studies and modern analytical techniques. I aimed to find out about (i) whether Tococa plants still possess chemical defenses against herbivores or entirely depend on the protection provided by their mutualistic ants. Special emphasis was placed on herbivore-inducible defenses, their regulation by phytohormones (ii), as well as the biosynthesis and role of the identified compounds (iii). For this purpose, novel analytical methods were developed to detect defensive metabolites and responses. Additionally, to obtain a holistic picture of this mutualism, the general metabolism of ant-plants, and how it is affected by the presence or absence of ants was examined as well.",gnd:4170911-1 gnd:4513887-4
Exploring time-variation in survival models,"The exploration of time-variation in survival models can be summarised in two general questions: First, can the effect of a covariate be assumed to be time-constant, or does it distinctly change over time? Secondly, if the effect changes over time, of which form is the dynamic structure? The book investigates possible approaches to explore these two questions. Flexible methods are proposed, which allow for a precise description of the underlying dynamic structures. An essential task in applied statistics is thereby to limit model complexity in order to maintain interpretable solutions. This implies model selection by comparison of models with different complexity. A major focus pursued in the book is to find a statistical model that is as complex as needed and as parsimonious as possible. Two different statistical concepts are considered: A likelihood based theory and Bayesian statistics. While model estimation in the likelihood framework is realised by maximising variants of the likelihood, in Bayesian statistics inference is based on posterior distributions of the model parameters. In the likelihood framework model selection can then be based on likelihood ratio tests, whereas in the Bayesian framework, Bayesian model criteria are employed to compare different, non-nested models. Beside the theoretical investigations, the particular structure of the data at hand leads to different modelling approaches. This is since survival time can either be continuous or discrete. Both situations are investigated by employing two different models, the dynamic Cox model for continuous survival time and the dynamic logit model for discrete data. Parsimony in modelling is highly relevant in practical work. The book therefore concentrates on methods which are straightforward to implement and use in practice. In particular it is ensured that methods are computationally feasible and easy to understand",gnd:4209029-5 gnd:4186609-5 gnd:4204326-8
"Consequences of rainforest conversion to smallholder rubber and oil palm plantations on soil trace gas fluxes from highly weathered soils in Sumatra, Indonesia","In Sumatra, Indonesia, the establishment of oil palm and rubber plantations is widespread. However, it occurs at the expense of forest area. Since global demand for palm oil and rubber is increasing, forest conversion is expected to continue. Furthermore, studies have shown that forest destruction and the establishment of agricultural land uses influence the soil–atmosphere exchange of the climate-relevant trace gases carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO).

Mechanical stimulation of in-vitro tissue growth using magnetic beads,"Cells and tissues are sensitive to mechanical forces applied to them. In particular, bone forming cells and connective tissues, composed of cells embedded in fibrous extracellular matrix (ECM), are continuously remodeled in response to the loads they bear. The mechanoresponses of cells embedded in tissue include proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, internal signaling between cells, and formation and resorption of tissue. Experimental in-vitro systems of various designs have demonstrated that forces affect tissue growth, maturation and mineralization. However, the results depended on different parameters such as the type and magnitude of the force applied in each study. Some experiments demonstrated that applied forces increase cell proliferation and inhibit cell maturation rate, while other studies found the opposite effect. When the effect of different magnitudes of forces was compared, some studies showed that higher forces resulted in a cell proliferation increase or differentiation decrease, while other studies observed the ...",gnd:4190674-3 gnd:4032651-2

Heteronuclear Efimov scenario in ultracold quantum gases : universality in systems with large mass imbalance,"This thesis represents a decisive breakthrough in our understanding of the physics of universal quantum-mechanical three-body systems. The Efimov scenario is a prime example of how fundamental few-body physics features universally across seemingly disparate fields of modern quantum physics. Initially postulated for nuclear physics more than 40 years ago, the Efimov effect has now become a new research paradigm not only in ultracold atomic gases but also in molecular, biological and condensed matter systems. Despite a lot of effort since its first observations, the scaling behavior, which is a hallmark property and often referred to as the “holy grail” of Efimov physics, remained hidden until recently. In this work, the author demonstrates this behavior for the first time for a heteronuclear mixture of ultracold Li and Cs atoms, and pioneers the experimental understanding of microscopic, non-universal properties in such systems. Based on the application of Born-Oppenheimer approximation, well known from molecular physics textbooks, an exceptionally clear and intuitive picture of heteronuclear Efimov physics is revealed",gnd:4012974-3 gnd:4132152-2 gnd:4187406-7 gnd:4147134-9 gnd:4402897-0 gnd:4762261-1 gnd:4755839-8 gnd:4167900-3 gnd:4820466-3 gnd:4563078-1
Receding horizon control : a suboptimality-based approach,"Within the proposed work we consider analytical, conceptional and implementational issues of so called receding horizon controllers in a sampled-data setting. The principle of such a controller is simple: Given the current state of a system we compute an open-loop control which is optimal for a given costfunctional over a fixed prediction horizon. Then, the control is implemented on the first sampling interval and the basic open-loop optimal control problem is shifted forward in time which allows for a repeated evaluation. The contribution of this thesis is threefold: First, we prove estimates for the performance of a receding horizon control, a concept which we call suboptimality degree. These estimate are online computable and can be applied for stabilizing as well as practically stabilizing receding horizon control laws. Moreover, they not only allow for guaranteeing stability of the closed-loop but also for quantifying the loss of performance of the receding horizon control law compared to the infinite horizon control law. Based on these estimates, we introduce adaptation strategies to modify the underlying receding horizon controller in order to guarantee a certain lower bound on the suboptimality degree while reducing the computing cost/time necessary to solve this problem. Within this analysis, the length of the optimization horizon is the parameter we wish to adapt ...",gnd:4177371-8 gnd:4171761-2 gnd:4271836-3 gnd:4129844-5

"‘Smart’ Janus emulsions : preparation, characterization, and application as a template for aerogel preparation","Emulsions constitute one of the most prominent and continuously evolving research areas in Colloid Chemistry, which involves the preparation of mixtures or dispersions of immiscible components in a continuous medium. Besides conventional oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsions, other emulsions of complex droplet morphologies have recently attracted significant research interests. Especially Janus emulsions, in which each droplet is comprised of two distinct sub-regions, have shown versatile potential applications. One of their advantages is the possibility of compartmentalization, which enables to play with two different chemistries in a single droplet. Though microfluidic methods are conventionally used to prepare Janus emulsions, their industrial applications are largely hindered by low throughput and extensive instrumentations.

Evolutionary conserved breakpoints in Old and New World monkeys and their relation to fragile sites observed in Homo sapiens,"Evolutionary conserved breakpoints (ECBs) in Old World Monkeys (OWMs) and New World Monkeys (NWMs) are localized in particular chromosomal bands and prone to breakage during the phylogeny. Similarly, fragile sites (FSs) are specific regions in Homo sapiens (HSA) which can be induced to form gaps or breaks. Notably, FSs can be involved in chromosomal rearrangements in cancer, owing as targets of carcinogens; also FSs have been positively correlated with breakpoints of constitutional rearrangements in human. Thus, a comparative study of the relation of ECBs and FSs is necessary to uncover the common underlying principles of chromosomal alterations in human diseases and evolution. Chromosomal homologies of HSA and OWMs/NWMs have previously been studied by chromosome banding and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). However, due to limitations in resolution of such techniques, in this study I applied for the first time multicolor banding (MCB) probe sets complemented with selected locus-specific and heterochromatin specific probes to characterize ECBs in Hylobates lar, eight OWMs and four NWMs. Thus, numerous new ECBs were characterized for the first time in detail, and centromeric positions in several species could be redefined. Also the results showed that the monkey chromosomes homologous to human #3, #7 and #9 presented enhanced rates of ECBs both in OWMs and NWMs. ECBs of NWMs and OWMs could be followed during evolution and aligned with FSs observed in HSA. Most interestingly more than 60% of ECBs co-localized with known FSs and ~70% of ECBs corresponded to breakpoints that can be observed in human disorders. For medical field this data is important as FSs now clearly were aligned on molecular level with ECBs. In other words the disease associated chromosomal defects, seem at least in parts be due to breakage prone regions of the mammalian genome.",gnd:4051253-8 gnd:4071050-6 gnd:4156640-3

Microsaccades : symbols in fixational eye movement,"The first thing we do upon waking is open our eyes. Rotating them in our eye sockets, we scan our surroundings and collect the information into a picture in our head. Eye movements can be split into saccades and fixational eye movements, which occur when we attempt to fixate our gaze. The latter consists of microsaccades, drift and tremor. Before we even lift our eye lids, eye movements – such as saccades and microsaccades that let the eyes jump from one to another position – have partially been prepared in the brain stem. Saccades and microsaccades are often assumed to be generated by the same mechanisms. But how saccades and microsaccades can be classified according to shape has not yet been reported in a statistical manner. Research has put more effort into the investigations of microsaccades’ properties and generation only since the last decade. Consequently, we are only beginning to understand the dynamic processes governing microsaccadic eye movements. Within this thesis, the dynamics governing the generation of microsaccades is assessed and the development of a model for the underlying processes. Eye movement trajectories from different experiments are used, recorded with a video-based eye tracking technique, and a novel method is proposed for the scale-invariant detection of saccades (events of large amplitude) and microsaccades (events of small amplitude). Using a time-frequency approach, the method is examined with different experiments and validated against simulated data.

In September 2016, the mission came to an end when Rosetta descended onto the surface for one final close up look at the surface. This thesis uses data from one...",gnd:4169895-2
Scattering amplitudes with the multi-loop numerical unitarity method,"Abstract: In this thesis, we develop and apply the D-dimensional numerical unitarity method for the computation of multi-loop scattering amplitudes, which are the key building blocks for precise theoretical predictions for the ongoing physics program of the Large Hadron Collider experiment at CERN. We formulate a framework for consistently implementing dimensional regularization in numerical approaches, which in particular can be applied for efficient numerical evaluations of dimensionally-regularized helicity amplitudes with external fermions. We present the next-to-leading order QCD predictions for the production of W boson in association with a pair of bottom quarks and light jets at the Large Hadron Collider, which is an irreducible background to the  the studies of decays of the Higgs boson to a pair of bottom quarks. We include all the effects of the non-vanishing bottom-quark mass. To obtain the one-loop matrix elements required for the process, we implement an extension of the numerical unitarity method to massive particles in the loop. We present the first benchmark values and analytic form of all two-loop five-parton helicity amplitudes in QCD in the leading-color approximation. The analytic expressions are reconstructed from exact numerical evaluations with the numerical unitarity method. Our results provide all two-loop amplitudes required for the calculation of next-to-next-to-leading order QCD corrections to the production of three jets at hadron colliders in the leading-color approximation",gnd:4128082-9
"The Dada archivist : Hannah Höch, Kurt Schwitters and Berlin Dada","""The archive of the German artist Hannah Höch (1889-1978) has long been an important source of material for historians researching the interwar avant-garde and artists associated with Berlin Dada. This book explores Höch's practices of organisation when assembling the documents in her house outside Berlin from 1939 until her death. Through extensive research, the author argues that Höch's archive should be considered not just a collection of documents but a work in its own right, intimately connected with the artist's daily life. Noting the importance of understanding the mechanisms of this work, the book suggests that Höch took charge of both preserving and exploring the possibilities of Dada long after the group had been officially dissolved. The file that Höch assembled on her friend, the artist Kurt Schwitters (1887-1948), plays an important part in the book, its content revealing how domestic habits infused both artists' practices. Juxtaposing Höch's archive and Schwitters's Merzbau, the author argues for an interactive movement between the two that has fundamental implications on how we understand both artists' œuvres""--",gnd:4010866-1 gnd:4002859-8 gnd:4128844-0

In the critical case, a systematical research on ground state solutions, including the existence, the nonexistence, the uniqueness and the phase separation phenomena of the limit profile has been presented, which seems to be the first contribution for BEC in the critical case.

Amperometric detection of hormonal activity by a yeast cell biosensor,"['The widespread use of natural and synthetic estrogens or chemicals with estrogenic activities is causing an increasing accumulation of estrogenic compounds in the environment. Already at very low concentrations these estrogenics can severely affect the wildlife, particularly in an aquatic environment. For these reasons measuring devices for detecting estrogen contaminations are in great demand. The majority of the analytical methods and bioassays on the market so far, lack semi-online adaptability, and usually cannot be used for automatic and continuous determination. Therefore, we have embarked on the development of new systems, which are able to fulfil those demands. The EstraMonitor combines recombinant A. adeninivorans G1212/YRC102-hERa-phyK yeast cells as the microbial component with an amperometric detection method to analyze estrogenic contaminations. A. adeninivorans G1212/YRC102-hERa-phyK was constructed by Kaiser et al. (2010). These cells were engineered to co-express the human estrogen receptor (hERa) gene and the inducible phytase (phyK, derived from Klebsiella sp.

In the presence of estrogenic substances, such as 17ß -estradiol (E2), the phyK gene is expressed and recombinant phytase is secreted into the media.

Die geomorphologische Entwicklung des Alfbachtals im quartären Vulkangebiet der Westeifel seit dem Denekamp-Interstadial : Vulkanismus als Ursache für die Entstehung glazigener Depotzentren,"Volcanic elevations and depressions pervade the landscape of the Quaternary Westeifel Volcanic Field and characterize the regional surface. Among other aspects they influence the morphology of the typically narrow and deeply-cut valleys as well as the course of the river systems. Nowadays the progress of erosion by rivers and the processes of embossing during the Weichselian Pleniglacial until the beginning of the Holocene are difficult to understand. However, in the Alf Valley near Gillenfeld and Strohn, these processes are readily traceable by a unique arrangement of young volcanoes and the distribution of their ejected products. The Wartgesberg- Volcano- Complex, formed around 33 ka ago, severely impacted the Alf Valley. Due to its position and promoted agglutinates, it led to the impoundment of the river and the leveling of the valley. This study presents a method which allows to reconstruct the paleo-valley surface in the area around the Wartgesberg-Volcano-Complex using the applications of ArcGIS, and to retrace the processes that have taken place in the Alf Valley during the last major glaciation. Step-by-step modeling provides an insight into the temporal development of the valley. The basis for the processing is delivered by a high-resolution digital elevation model, geomorphological mapping, drill holes and geophysical investigations. Using this technique, the paleo-valley surface is reconstructed. The result constitutes a detailed description of the area around the Alf Valley before the start of the volcanic activity that profoundly reshaped the regional landscape.",gnd:4136102-7 gnd:4064081-4 gnd:4130684-3
Impact of microcystin on the non-canonical localization of RubisCO in the toxic bloom-forming cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa PCC7806,"Cyanobacteria are an abundant bacterial group and are found in a variety of ecological niches all around the globe. They can serve as a real threat for fish or mammals and can restrict the use of lakes or rivers for recreational purposes or as a source of drinking water, when they form blooms.

In the first part of the study, the role and possible dynamics of RubisCO in M. aeruginosa during high-light irradiation were examined. Its response was analyzed on the protein and peptide level via immunoblotting, immunofluorescence microscopy and with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). It was revealed that large amounts of RubisCO were located outside of carboxysomes under the applied high light stress. RubisCO aggregated mainly underneath the cytoplasmic membrane.

Combining X-ray and optical/NIR data to study GRBs and their host galaxies,"This thesis focuses on the topic of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), which is currently one of the most fascinating research fields in Astrophysics. Gamma-Ray Bursts are flashes of high-energy radiation which appear in the sky at random times from random directions. Briefly, from a few milliseconds to a few minutes, they outshine every other source of gamma-rays in the sky, and then they fade away. The current model to explain the large amount of energy released during a GRB is the fireball model. Within this framework, the energy is released in a short period of time by the collapse of the core of a massive star or the merger of two compact stellar objects. The collapse of this compact object ejects ultra-relativistic polar jets. The internal dissipation of energy within the jets leads to non-thermal high-energy emission, the GRB itself. The shock created from the deceleration of the relativistic outflow in the interstellar medium leads to a long-lasting transient, visible from X-rays to the radio band, called afterglow.",gnd:4322458-1

This thesis presents the results of time-dependent tight-binding simulations of radiation damage, in which the evolution of a coupled system of energetic classical ions and quantum mechanical electrons is correctly described. The effects of electronic excitations in collision cascades and ion channeling are explored and a new model is presented, which makes possible the accurate reproduction of non-adiabatic electronic forces in large-scale classical molecular dynamics simulations of metals.",gnd:4057825-2 gnd:4463785-8 gnd:4038860-8 gnd:4318601-4

"Beweidete lichte Wälder in Baden-Württemberg: Genese, Vegetation, Struktur, Management","['Zusammenfassung: For the research project latterly pastured open woodlands were examined, with regard to their potentials for nature and landscape conservation. Such biotopes represent an endangered biotype in Southwest Germany and keep declining both in area and number. Pasture woodlands are regarded as bearing a high degree of biodiversity, cultural and agricultural values. The research topics were:  • Analysis and categorization of the locations and developments of these forests • Clarification of management concepts and operational philosophies by interviewing forest operators/managers • Analysis of impacts of modern pastoral woodland on biodiversity by comparing open woodland biotype to neighbouring dense forests with regard to floral and structural differences  100 open pasture woodlands, many more than expected, had been found. These biotopes becoming increasingly frequent in agriculturally unprofitable areas. The used grazing animals, sheep, goats, cattle, and horses, are all typical of Germany as a whole. Exotic animals are exceptions. Each of those woodlands took shape through a different combination of historical usages, environmental conditions, grazing animals and management ideas, and is therefore unique from each other. The open pasture woodlands are typically smaller than 10 ha and isolated from one another. Pasture tradition reaches from several hundred-year-old traditional pasture-woodland to newly created ones. The driving forces behind wood pasture are most importantly landscape conservation, increasing biodiversity, economic reasons and continuation of traditions. Owners favour breeds that are old, robust and undemanding, they apply long-term considerations and minimizing negative impacts on the wooded biotypes. Pasture woodlands are not silviculturally used, they mostly serve as elements in support of pasture farming. Through a combination of species-appropriate environments, well-rounded diets, reduced parasites and healthy offspring, the most important advantage of open pasture woodland is on the overall health of the animals. The greatest potential of modern open pasture woodlands concerning nature conservation purposes lies in their ability to raise the local biodiversity. Open pasture woodlands allow for the creation of highly livable and experiencable landscapes alongside with their ecological and socio-economic benefits.

Global limits on silicate weathering and implications for the silicate weathering feedback,"Chemical weathering of silicate rocks is considered responsible for the stabilization of atmospheric CO2 and climate on geological time scales. The strength of this negative feedback is hard to establish on a global scale due to the spatial variability of controlling factors of weathering such as climate, physical erosion and biotic activity. In order to investigate if there is a simple way of including spatial variability of climatic and tectonic drivers of weathering a new model of the regolith, which specifically considers the physical transports of water, carbon and minerals as boundary conditions for chemical weathering rates, was developed. This is in contrast to previous global models, in which chemical kinetics and thus temperature is considered of primary importance and physical transports are considered secondary in nature. The model is able to satisfactorily simulate river concentrations of elements relevant to the silicate weathering feedback for a present day scenario. If chemical weathering is limited by mineral supply, an increase in the climatic potential for dissolution and transport has no effect on chemical weathering rate. This suggests that mineral supply limitation weakens the silicate weathering feedback. Also, biotic enhancement of weathering is limited by mineral supply and by inference tectonic uplift. The model suggests that there are some inherent problems associated with the use of factorial laws in global models of the geological carbon cycle. This indicates that an integrated approach, in which all drivers of weathering are considered simultaneously, is preferable to separate empirical parameterizations, because a change in one driver might lessen the impact of the other drivers. This can only be achieved with process-based models. The principle of co-limitation associated with the physical transports of water, carbon, and minerals seems universal in setting the boundaries for the potential feedback.",gnd:4209283-8 gnd:4048655-2 gnd:4063385-8 gnd:4057696-6 gnd:4368274-1 gnd:4015366-6 gnd:4181361-3

Fiber-based light sources for coherent raman scattering and multi-photon imaging,"The progress in medicine, sanitation and overall prosperity has led to an increasing life-expectancy in developed countries. Consequently, degenerative and lifestyle-induced diseases, such as cardiovascular ones, Alzheimer's and certain types of cancer are the major cause of death in these countries today. As a result, the focus of bio-medical research has shifted towards early detection and treatment methods to mitigate the etiopathology of these degenerative diseases. However, their early diagnosis requires the detection of molecular perturbations on a microscopic scale, e.g. DNA mutations in the case of cancer. As a result, new imaging methods for a routine use in a medical environment are required. Imaging methods based on coherent Raman scattering are, nowadays, among the most potent techniques for a rapid visualization of the chemical composition of complex structures with sub-micrometer resolution. In particular, these methods are called Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering, stimulated Raman scattering and the Raman induced Kerr effect. All of these techniques have attracted great interest in the life and material science communities, since they are able to detect different molecules by their specific vibrational spectra. This potentially leads to label-free detection and fluorescence-free marking via small reporter molecules, e.g. alkyne tags or deuterated drugs. This intriguing feature, which has been known since the dusk of the last millennium, could not find routine usage outside specialized laser laboratories staffed with experienced laser scientists, because laser sources for CRS imaging are, even today, driven by large and complex laser setups.

Infrarot- und Massenspektrometer-System für die dynamische Messung von Motorabgasen,"['Due to growing individual transport in industrial countries and associated increase in pollutant emissions, legislature toughens emission standards regularly. Automakers are therefor challenged to develop ever more efficient low-emission vehicles to take account of the public climate debate and effects of pollutants on humans and nature. Conventional exhaust gas measurement systems are limited when it comes to measuring gases other than O2, CO2, CO, NOX and total-HC or when high measurement frequencies are of the essence to resolve transient processes. Additional specialized single component measurement systems increase the already high complexity of conventional exhaust emission measurement devices. Topic of this work was the study of all aspects of a mobile, versatile and dynamic exhaust gas measurement system, which integrates the multi component measurement systems mass spectrometer and Fourier-Transform infrared spectrometer. Analyzers were specifically modified and optimized for this application, a common sampling system was designed, and a corresponding software structure was realized. Methods were researched for the optimal adjustment of the system to different applications and for increasing system stability as well as minimizing calibration effort by measuring combustion products like CO2 and H2O and other components with both analyzers in parallel. Additionally Argon is used as some kind of internal standard to adjust and stabilize the mass spectrometer. Measurements in the laboratory and on gasoline and diesel engines show, that limited and non-limited as well as other exhaust gas components can be detected in concentrations down to 1 ppm and with up to 20 Hz. As exemplary applications the measurement of all main exhaust gas components, the differentiation of hydro carbons, the behavior of nitrogen oxides and ammonia on a SCR catalytic converter, the detection of hydrogen in gasoline engine exhaust and the determination of exhaust mass flow rate using Helium as tracer gas are demonstrated. This work shows the advantages of the hybrid measurement system over conventional exhaust emission measurement devices. Higher measurement frequency and much broader spectrum of detectable gas components open a very wide field of application. Lower calibration effort and compact design allow an efficient operation on a regular basis. It can be advantageous deployed to solve current and future problems in exhaust gas measurement as well as outside this field of application.', 'Um der Zunahme von Schadstoffemissionen durch den stetig wachsenden motorisierten Individualverkehr in Industrienationen entgegenzuwirken, werden seitens der Gesetzgeber Emissionsgrenzwerte regelmäßig verschärft.

Konventionelle Abgasmesstechniken stoßen bei aktuellen Fragestellungen an ihre Grenze, wenn neben O2, CO2, CO, NOX und Gesamt-HC weitere Stoffe gemessen, oder mit einer hohen Messfrequenz transiente Vorgänge abgebildet werden müssen. Durch den Einsatz zusätzlicher, spezieller Einkomponenten-Messsysteme wird die bereits hohe Komplexität der konventionellen Abgasmessanlagen weiter gesteigert. Gegenstand dieser Arbeit war die Untersuchung gerätetechnischer und methodischer Aspekte eines mobilen, universellen und dynamischen Abgasmesssystems, das die bei- den an Prüfständen etablierten Mehrkomponenten-Messsysteme Massenspektrometer und Fourier-Transform-Infrarot-Spektrometer integriert. Dazu wurden Analysatoren speziell für diese Anwendung modifiziert und optimiert, eine gemeinsame Probenahme ausgelegt und eine entsprechende Softwarestruktur realisiert. Es sind Methoden untersucht worden, mit denen das hybride Messsystem optimal für unterschiedliche Anwendungen einzustellen ist, durch parallele Messungen der Verbrennungsprodukte CO2 und H2O sowie weiterer Stoffe die Systemstabilität gesteigert und der Kalibrieraufwand minimiert wird. Argon kann dabei als eine Art interner Standard zur Einstellung und Stabilisierung des Massenspektrometers genutzt werden. Messungen im Labor sowie an Otto- und Dieselmotoren zeigen, dass limitierte und nicht- limitierte Schadstoffe sowie weitere Abgaskomponenten ab Konzentrationen von ca. 1 ppm mit bis zu 20 Hz gemessen werden können. Als beispielhafte Anwendungen werden die Messung der Abgas-Hauptkomponenten, die Differenzierung von Kohlenwasserstoffen, das Verhalten von Stickoxiden und Ammoniak am SCR-Katalysator, der Nachweis von Wasserstoff im Ottoabgas sowie die Bestimmung des Abgasmassenstroms mittels Helium als Tracergas aufgezeigt.

Single artificial-atom lasing of a dressed flux qubit,"Superconducting quantum bits originally developed for quantum computation have properties similar to real atoms. Because they are micro fabricated circuits, their interaction with electromagnetic radiation can be engineered and effects known from quantum optics may be realized. In this work, a unique lasing scheme exploiting only the lowest two levels of a single artificial atom coupled to a high-quality superconducting resonator is experimentally realized. It is based on the dressing of the atom’s states by a strong signal and the associated rescaling of the relaxation. In addition, basic physical processes are discussed by a separate characterization of the artificial atom, the resonator, and their coupling. A quantum theory including dissipative processes is developed from basic superconducting effects and its applicability demonstrated by a perfect agreement with the experimental results.

Kapitalismus und funktionale Differenzierung : eine kritische Rekonstruktion,"Can Luhmann be read critically? Can Systems Theory be used as a sort of critical theory of capitalism? This book does not confront Marx against Luhmann, but combines them in order to reconstruct the internal connection between capitalism and the functional differentiation of society. Capitalism signifies thus not the primacy of economic relations, but an institutional arrangement supporting a specific logic of social reproduction. However, the development of this logic is characterized by deep contradictions, which unleash different patterns of accumulation and social conflicts. But this logic produces at the same time its own stability. Therefore, the task of changing society is more difficult than ever. We need a sophisticated conceptualization, to be obtained against dogmatic conceptions of any kind, if we want to understand this complicated dynamic. This book reinterprets key concepts of Systems Theory, loading them with historical contend, and rearticulating them within the framework of a theory of capitalism.

Enzymkatalyse in verschiedenen Formen der lichtabhängigen NADPH : Protochlorophyllid-Oxidreduktase,"Light-dependent NADPH:protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase catalyses the photoreduction of protochlorophyllide to chlorophyllide in chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway. In this NADPH-dependent reaction a proton and a hydride are transferred to C17-C18 double bond of protochlorophyllide. The intramolecular charge transfer state of protochlorophyllide is assumed to play an important role during photoreduction. This work could show that formation of this state accompanies a red shift of the C(13')=O carbonyl stretching mode of the isocyclic fifth ring of protochlorophyllide, indicating an increase in the carbonyl bond length which is possibly evoked by hyrogen-bonding interactions. Protein sites in the catalytic pocket handicap the formation of the triplet state of protochlorophyllide, which stands in direct competition with the formation of the intramolecular charge transfer state. Moreover, a strong blue shift in the excited-state absorption of the intramolecular charge transfer state was observed, indicating a state stabilization by the protein sites. This stabilization could be due to hydrogen-bonding interactions, too. Point mutations in the binding pocket of protochlorophyllide demonstrate a radical reduction of the enzymatic activity for the substitution of each amino acid. That is, the possiblility to form such hydrogen bonds is given for all amino acids in the binding pocket of protochlorophyllide. NADPH:protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase shows a higher efficiency after excitation with red light than with blue light. The result of this dependency on the excitation wavelength is a reduced population of the triplet state after excitation with red light.",gnd:4152480-9 gnd:4006902-3 gnd:4347736-7 gnd:4147817-4 gnd:4337771-3 gnd:4071050-6

While bottlebrushes have received much attention due to the recent discovery of their unprecedented properties, including supersoftness, ultra-low viscosity, and hyperelasticity, this thesis is the first fundamental investigation at the molecular level that comprises structure and dynamics. Neutron scattering experiments, detailed within, reveal spherical or cylindrical shapes, instead of a random coil conformation. Another highlight is the analysis of the fast dynamics at the sub nm-length scale. The combination of three neutron spectrometers and the development of a new analysis technique enabled the calculation of the mean-square displacement over seven orders of magnitude in time scale. This unprecedented result can be applied to a broad class of samples, including polymers and other materials.

On the role of trade-offs in predator-prey interactions,"Predation drives coexistence, evolution and population dynamics of species in food webs, and has strong impacts on related ecosystem functions (e.g. primary production). The effect of predation on these processes largely depends on the trade-offs between functional traits in the predator and prey community. Trade-offs between defence against predation and competitive ability, for example, allow for prey speciation and predator-mediated coexistence of prey species with different strategies (defended or competitive), which may stabilize the overall food web dynamics. While the importance of such trade-offs for coexistence is widely known, we lack an understanding and the empirical evidence of how the variety of differently shaped trade-offs at multiple trophic levels affect biodiversity, trait adaptation and biomass dynamics in food webs. Such mechanistic understanding is crucial for predictions and management decisions that aim to maintain biodiversity and the capability of communities to adapt to environmental change ensuring their ...",gnd:4225737-2 gnd:4064937-4
Carbonate-silicate reactions at conditions of the Earth’s mantle and the role of carbonates as possible trace-element carriers,"Carbonates play a key role in the chemistry and dynamics of our planet. They are directly connected to the CO2 budget of our atmosphere and have a great impact on the deep carbon cycle. Moreover, recent studies have shown that carbonates are stable along the geothermal gradient down to Earth's lower mantle conditions, changing their crystal structure and related properties. Subducted carbonates may also react with silicates to form new phases. These reactions will redistribute elements, such as calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe) and carbon in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2), but also trace elements, that are carried by the carbonates. The trace elements of most interest are strontium (Sr) and rare earth elements (REE) which have been found to be important constituents in the composition of the primitive lower mantle and in mineral inclusions found in super-deep diamonds. However, the stability of carbonates in presence of mantle silicates at relevant temperatures is far from being well understood. Related to this, very little is ...",gnd:4147300-0 gnd:4173836-6 gnd:4172557-8 gnd:4282597-0 gnd:4057696-6 gnd:4160091-5 gnd:4077444-2 gnd:4132099-2 gnd:4412262-7 gnd:4488188-5 gnd:4121076-1 gnd:4138985-2
Moderation of rRNA gene activity triggers metabolic adaptation promoting geroprotection in Caenorhabditis elegans,"Despite aging being inevitable, the rate of aging is malleable. An energy-saving, catabolic state promotes longevity, whereas major anabolic activities like ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis are linked to accelerated aging. Both processes are hinged on the transcription of rRNA genes (rDNA) into a pre-ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) by RNA polymerase I (Pol I). Pol I accounts for most of the cell’s transcriptional output and presides over major pathways of macromolecule biosynthesis; however, its role in aging is not well understood. To investigate how the Pol I transcription machinery impacts lifespan and healthspan, its activity was manipulated in the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). First, NCL-1, a repressor of ribosome biogenesis, was knocked down, leading to elevated pre-rRNA levels but reduced lifespan. The negative correlation between pre-rRNA synthesis and lifespan was corroborated by overexpression of the essential transcription factor TIF-IA. In contrast, TIF-IA depletion impaired rDNA activity and prolonged the survival of worms. To understand how TIF-IA KD promotes longevity, metabolic adaptation to moderate pre-rRNA synthesis was investigated. TIF-IA KD repressed the age-dependent accumulation of yolk proteins, revealing another way of alleviating the metabolic burden. Accordingly, old and young TIF-IA depleted worms exhibited a marked increase in ATP levels compared to age-matched control worms. Given the close relationship between energy and lipid metabolism, lipidomics demonstrated that the profile of membrane and storage lipids was altered towards a longevity signature upon TIF-IA KD. Taken together, this study has uncovered how moderation of pre-rRNA synthesis concerts metabolic responses that promote healthy aging in C. elegans. Based on the structural and functional conservation of the Pol I machinery, these insights are likely translatable to mammalian aging, rendering Pol I a prime candidate for novel aging interventions.",gnd:4076715-2 gnd:4488799-1 gnd:4147127-1
Totally degenerated formal schemes,"In this thesis, we study the rigid analytic Picard variety for a certain class of higher dimensional rigid analytic varieties over a complete non-Archimedean valued field; namely those which have a totally degenerated formal model. These varieties are a natural generalization of the well-known Mumford curves into higher dimensions. We show that the Picard variety in this case is given by a quotient of an algebraic torus by a multiplicative lattice - a fact which is well-known for Mumford curves. In special cases, we give a criterion when the Picard variety is proper; i.e. when the lattice has full rank.",gnd:4425163-4 gnd:4251689-4
Hybrid filters and multi-scale models,"This thesis is concerned with Data Assimilation, the process of combining model predictions with observations. So called filters are of special interest. One is inter- ested in computing the probability distribution of the state of a physical process in the future, given (possibly) imperfect measurements. This is done using Bayes’ rule. The first part focuses on hybrid filters, that bridge between the two main groups of filters: ensemble Kalman filters (EnKF) and particle filters. The first are a group of very stable and computationally cheap algorithms, but they request certain strong assumptions. Particle filters on the other hand are more generally applicable, but computationally expensive and as such not always suitable for high dimensional systems. Therefore it exists a need to combine both groups to benefit from the advantages of each. This can be achieved by splitting the likelihood function, when assimilating a new observation and treating one part of it with an EnKF and the other part with a particle filter.

Lewis base catalyzed reactions with latent nucleophiles and phosphonium intermediates,"The aim of this thesis was to develop solutions to overcome the common problem related to nucleophile scope in Lewis base catalyzed reactions and develop new synthetic methods and generate new knowledge and deeper understanding of these processes. Relying on the strategies used in previous Lewis base catalyzed allylic substitutions using N-H acidic nucleophiles, we have expanded the scope to allylation of anilines that have been considered insufficiently N-H acidic for applications in such reactions. The concept of latent nucleophiles was the development of enantioselective N-allylation of N-silyl pyrroles, indoles and carbazoles using allylic luorides. They proceed with excellent regioselectivity and expand the scope of Lewis base catalyzed allylic substitutions to otherwise problematic nucleophiles. Further application of the concept of latent nucleophiles in Lewis base catalysis was pursued with C-centered nucleophiles for introduction of difluoromethyl phosphonate moiety. In contrast, the work presented in this thesis on reactions catalyzed by P-centered Lewis bases was focused on the possibility of simultaneous dual activation of small organic molecules with Lewis acids and Lewis bases that do not form stable Lewis adducts and constitute non-traditional frustrated Lewis pairs. The work on the development of 1,2-reduction of ynones and trans-hydroboration of ynoates highlighted the versatile reactivity of vinyl hosphonium salts and inspired further studies involving these types of intermediates. Interest in reactivity of vinyl phosphonium ions informed the interest in reactivity of aryl phosphonium ions. In this area, we have shown that thiazoles and benzothiazoles undergo regioselective C2-H functionalization to form thiazol-2-yltriphenylphosphonium salts which undergo efficient substitution reactions with N-, O-, S and Se-centered nucleophiles to introduce various heteroatom substituents in the C2 position of thiazoles and benzothiazole.",gnd:4349284-8 gnd:4029919-3 gnd:4319757-7

High resolution multi-wavelength study of active galaxies,"This PhD thesis presents a study of active galaxies carried out from cm- to mm-wavelengths with high angular resolution. The mechanism of the activity in these objects is supposed to be strongly correlated with the accretion of matter onto a super-massive black hole in their centres. One approach to increase the understanding of these highly interesting sources is to observe and analyse the molecular gas. The characteristics of its distribution and dynamics are indispensible diagnostic tools to investigate the accretion processes at different angular scales. A second approach is the study of emission originating in the direct vicinity of the black hole, such as non-thermal radio emission. To account for different activity levels, five objects were chosen ranging from nearby, Low Luminosity Active Galaxies (LLAGs; NGC3718 at z=0.003 and NGC1068 at z=0.004) to higher redshifted, High LAGs (HLAGs; HE1029-1831 at z=0.039, 3C48 at z=0.367, and Q0957+561 at z=1.414). The first two sources are part of the NU(clei of)-GA(laxy) project, that aims at analysing the distribution and kinematics of the molecular gas at high angular resolution/sensitivity in a sample of 30 nearby LLAGs. HE1029-1831 is part of a complementary sample of nearby HLAGs with similar aims. All sources were observed in carbon-monoxide (CO), known to be a good molecular gas tracer, with the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI) providing high sensitivity and high angular resolution. CO emission was detected in all five galaxies. In NGC3718, the molecular gas disk, having roughly two hundred million solar masses, is highly warped.

"Glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs) and GPI-anchored proteins tethered to lipid bilayers : modelling a complex interplay of carbohydrates, proteins and lipids","Glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs) are highly complex glycolipids that serve as membrane anchors to a large variety of eukaryotic proteins. These are covalently attached to a group of peripheral proteins called GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) through a post-translational modification in the endoplasmic reticulum. The GPI anchor is a unique structure composed of a glycan, with phospholipid tail at one end and a phosphoethanolamine linker at the other where the protein attaches. The glycan part of the GPI comprises a conserved pseudopentasaccharide core that could branch out to carry additional glycosyl or phosphoethanolamine units. GPI-APs are involved in a diverse range of cellular processes, few of which are signal transduction, protein trafficking, pathogenesis by protozoan parasites like the malaria- causing parasite Plasmodium falciparum. GPIs can also exist freely on the membrane surface without an attached protein such as those found in parasites like Toxoplasma gondii, the causative agent of Toxoplasmosis.

Elucidating the (re-)emergence of human pathogens with Bayesian phylogenetics,"The (re-)emergence of an infectious disease is a complex phenomenon that requires the interplay of multiple factors involving the pathogen (e.g. virulence, transmissibility, immune scape capacity), host species (e.g. population size, mobility, immunity level) and the environment (e.g. climatic conditions, hygiene conditions). In the manuscripts included in this thesis, I employed Bayesian phylogenetic models to elucidate the (re-)emergence of three human pathogens that occurred under different conditions and at distinct time points. At the start of the timeline, represented by the analyzed datasets, I investigated, in manuscript C, the emergence of human-adapted Salmonella enterica enterica serovars and its connection to animal domestication, by performing a molecular dating analysis using modern samples and ancient genomes up to 5500 years old. Moving forward in the timeline, in Manuscript A, I studied the migration dynamics of the bacterium Yersinia pestis in Madagascar to elucidate the factors that led to the re-emergence of plague in the city of Mahajanga during the 1990s. Lastly, in Manuscript B, I performed a recombination-aware phylogenetic analysis to clarify the role of genetic recombination in the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, the latest human pathogen to cause a severe pandemic, which started in 2019. Altogether the three manuscripts provide new knowledge about the (re-)emergence of viral and bacterial pathogens that have left an indelible mark on human history.

Photogrammetry and distinct element geomechanical modelling of sinkholes and large-scale karstic depressions,"Sinkholes and depressions are typical landforms of karst regions. They pose a considerable natural hazard to infrastructure, agriculture, economy and human life in affected areas worldwide.

Banach spaces-valued ergodic theorems and spectral approximation,"The present dissertation thesis is concerned with Banach space-valued convergence theorems along Folner type sequences in geometries with amenable structures. The text contains new ergodic theorems for groups, as well as an almost-additive and a subadditive convergence theorem for hyperfinite, weakly convergent graph sequences. All these results - among them abstract mean and pointwise ergodic theorems - significantly extend the literature on ergodic theorems. As an application, one obtains the uniform convergence of the integrated density of states (IDS) for pattern-invariant, finite hopping range operators in a wide range of amenable situations. A different kind of spectral approximation is given by a strong result for Ihara's Zeta function associated with sofic graphings. It is shown that compact convergence can be obtained for the normalized finite versions corresponding to the elements in a weakly convergent graph sequence.",gnd:4152756-2 gnd:4737230-8 gnd:4004402-6
The afterglows of swift-era short and long gamma-ray bursts,"The phenomenon of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) has been a great mystery since their discovery four decades ago. Even today, over a decade into the ""afterglow age"", many questions are still unanswered. The canonical picture which satisfies most of the data is that GRBs are produced when a massive celestial body (either a post-main sequence star or merging compact objects) at cosmological distances collapses to a rapidly rotating compact object (a black hole, for example) which launches ultra-relativistic polar jets. The internal dissipation of energy within the jets leads to collimated non-thermal high-energy emission (the actual GRB), whereas shocks created from the interactions of the jets with the interstellar medium create a long-lasting fading afterglow. ...",gnd:4322458-1
One-sided communication on a non-cache-coherent many-core architecture,"Contemporary multi-core processors are parallel systems that also provide shared memory for programs running on them.  Both the increasing number of cores in so-called many-core systems and the still growing computational power of the cores demand for memory systems that are able to deliver high bandwidths. Caches are essential components to satisfy this requirement. Nevertheless, hardware-based cache coherence in many-core chips faces practical limits to provide both coherence and high memory bandwidths. In addition, a shift away from global coherence can be observed. As a result, alternative architectures and suitable programming models need to be investigated. This thesis focuses on fast communication for non-cache-coherent many-core architectures. Experiments are conducted on the Single-Chip Cloud Computer (SCC), a non-cache-coherent many-core processor with 48 mesh-connected cores. Although originally designed for message passing, the results of this thesis show that shared memory can be efficiently used for one-sided…",gnd:4048717-9 gnd:4375209-3 gnd:7623494-0 gnd:7598578-0

Cognitive Spacetime : a Contribution to Human-Centered Adaptivity in E-Learning,"The raise of so-called artificial intelligence has made people believe that computers may some day be congenial with human beings. In the past computers were regarded as effective but soulless and unintelligent assistants to free humans from routine tasks. Computers were supposed to perform time-consuming but mechanical calculations. Today's computers are universal machines that can execute an almost unlimited variety of software. The increase of processing speed allows us to implement complex software which does not seem to have much in common with past computing machinery. In the field of education this awakened the desire to build algorithms which didactically support learners or even emulate human-like tutors. However, despite the apparent complexity of today's software, algorithms are step-by-step procedures which in their core are purely mechanical. So before introducing just another approach for technology-enhanced learning let me reconsider a seemingly naive but fundamental question. Given the nature of how computers work on the machine-level, can we emulate human-like tutors with computers? I believe that we can not because human beings are in possession of abilities which can not be implemented with algorithms due to their mechanical kernel and the formal systems on which algorithms are built. However, there exists a concept with which we can implement a mutual human-machine interaction that enables computers to at least adapt themselves to a learner. The result of this is what we call ""adaptive systems"". In this work, I present a method based on spatio-temporal data structures and algorithms which enable us to build technically simple but artificially intelligent self-adapting systems. Such systems can be utilized for technology enhanced learning but also for other fields related to human-machine interaction.",gnd:4201713-0 gnd:4033447-8 gnd:4125909-9 gnd:4727098-6
Mechanochemically synthesized conversion electrodes and their application in sodium and lithium ion batteries with diglyme electrolytes,"The strongly limited abundance of lithium (Li) and also that of other elements contained in a Li-ion battery (LIB) leads to the need of low-cost and more abundant alternatives. Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are a promising alternative as sodium (Na) cells show similar properties to the Li analogues in many cases and allow the use of more environmentally friendly and/or more abundant electrode materials. In comparison to the well-known and commercially used intercalation type electrodes, conversion electrodes enable the transfer of several electrons per formula unit of an electrode material and hence provide higher specific capacities. Conversion electrodes may be classified into alloys and transition metal compounds, both being studied within this dissertation. The first publication (doi: 10.1002/ente.201900389) in this cumulative thesis deals about the influence of the ball milling time onto the electrochemical performance for an SnSb/C intermetallic phase and Sn+Sb/C mixture as an example for alloy electrodes. Herein, it is found that longer milling leads to a more stable composite formation with carbon in order to enhance the cycle life for Sn+Sb and SnSb by galvanostatic cycling and in situ dilatometry studies. In the second publication (doi: 10.1016/j.powera.2020.100031) Cu3P is studied as a transition metal compound electrode, which is found to show a better electrochemical performance for the use of an ether electrolyte in comparison to carbonate electrolytes for both, LIBs and NIBs. In the last publication, (doi: 10.1002/adfm.201910583) a thiophosphate (Cu3PS4) was considered as an electrode material for the first time for NIBs which shows a by sulfur dominated redox activity with capacities of about 450 mAh g−1 after 1400 cycles @1 A g−1 in a voltage window between 0.01 and 2.5 V vs. Na+/Na.

Endocrine effects of plasticizers and the development of a breast cell-based toxicity screening system,"Humans are frequently exposed to a variety of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), which can cause harmful effects, e.g. disturbance of growth, development and reproduction, and cancer (UBA, 2016). EDCs are often components of synthetically manufactured products. Materials made of plastics, building materials, electronic items, textiles or cosmetic products can be particularly contaminated (Ain et al., 2021). One group of EDCs that has gained increased interest in recent years is phthalates. They are used as plasticizers in plastic materials to which people are daily exposed to. Phthalate plasticizers exert their harmful effects among others via activation of the estrogen receptor α (ERα), the estrogen receptor β (ERβ) and via inhibition of the androgen receptor (AR).

Development of efficient open-source chemical graph generators,"In chemistry, one of the crucial problems has been the structure identification of molecules, whose chemical composition is unknown. This research topic has impacts on various fields such as natural product and drug discovery studies. For the efficient and the fast identification process, computer assisted structure elucidation (CASE) toolkits has been developed. These tools utilise spectral data of unknown molecules as the input to determine their structure. The effectiveness of these software primarily depends on how well the structure generators perform. The basic input for these generators is the molecular formula of the unknown molecule to generate its unique list of isomers. In cheminformatics, there has been several software for the structure generation, especially, MOLGEN was considered as the de-facto gold standard in the field due to its speed and efficiency. However, it is a commercial tool and there was the need of an efficient open-source structure generators, in other words, chemical graph generators. To fulfil this need, the development of efficient open-source chemical graph generators was aimed for this PhD study, and the aim was succeeded by the development of two software, namely, MAYGEN and surge. First MAYGEN was developed as an alternative to MOLGEN. It was benchmarked against MOLGEN and was just around 3 times slower than MOLGEN. Following MAYGEN, another software, surge, was developed as an open-source chemical graph generator. It was benchmarked against MOLGEN for randomly chosen natural products' molecular formulae. Based on the results, surge is approximately 100 times faster than MOLGEN, which made it the state-of-art in the field.",gnd:4113782-6 gnd:4705829-8

Structure and petrophysical properties of the Southern Chile subduction zone along 38.25°S from seismic data,"Active and passive source data from two seismic experiments within the interdisciplinary project TIPTEQ (from The Incoming Plate to mega Thrust EarthQuake processes) were used to image and identify the structural and petrophysical properties (such as P- and S-velocities, Poisson's ratios, pore pressure, density and amount of fluids) within the Chilean seismogenic coupling zone at 38.25°S, where in 1960 the largest earthquake ever recorded (Mw 9.5) occurred. Two S-wave velocity models calculated using traveltime and noise tomography techniques were merged with an existing velocity model to obtain a 2D S-wave velocity model, which gathered the advantages of each individual model. In a following step, P- and S-reflectivity images of the subduction zone were obtained using different pre stack and post-stack depth migration techniques. Among them, the recent prestack line-drawing depth migration scheme yielded revealing results. Next, synthetic seismograms modelled using the reflectivity method allowed, through their input 1D synthetic P- and S-velocities, to infer the composition and rocks within the subduction zone. Finally, an image of the subduction zone is given, jointly interpreting the results from this work with results from other studies.

Developed from a PhD thesis, this book explores precisely this ""oscillating"" character of quotations: It discusses the nature of quotations and the relationship between common quotations and phraseology from a theoretical and an empirical perspective. Shakespeare's Hamlet was chosen as a canonical text whose frequently quoted traces can be followed across centuries. Scholarly work from various disciplines leads to an understanding of quotations as moving in a space created by the two dimensions of reference and repetition: Quotations are definable by a horizontal communicative axis (reference) and a vertical, intertextual axis of manifest lineages of use (repetition). Empirically, the data led to a categorisation of quotations as verbal, thematic and onomastic, based on the question ""what has been repeated: words, themes or names?"" Case studies further corroborate the proposition that verbal quotations may become (almost) ordinary multi-word units if the following conditions are met: a) they lose their referential dimension, b) they develop formal and/or semantic usage patterns and/or c) they are no longer limited to their original, literary discourse",gnd:4076108-3 gnd:4165338-5 gnd:4406207-2 gnd:7724795-4 gnd:4137933-0 gnd:4127276-6 gnd:4067889-1

Untersuchungen zur Expression und Funktion pH-regulatorischer Transporter beim Glioblastoma multiforme,"['Glioblastom, Teniposid, Ibuprofen, Diclofenac, Celecoxib, Nichtsteroidales Antiphlogistikum, Zytostatikum, Natrium-Protonen-Austauscher, Monocarboxylattransporter, pH-regulatorische Transporter, NHE1, MCT1', 'Glioblastoma are amongst the most aggressive brain tumors. Despite intensive research for new therapeutical options the mean survival time is still between 12 to 15 months. Like in other solid tumors, changes in the intercellular (pHi) and extracellular (pHe) pH compared to non-malignant tissue can also be observed in glioblastoma. In tumors the pHi is in the alkaline range while the pHe is more acidic. These differences in pH facilitate the development and progression of tumors and increase uncontrolled proliferation and evolution of resistances as well as infiltration of surrounding tissue. PH-regulatory transporters like the sodium-proton exchanger (NHE), the monocarboxylate transporters (MCT) and sodium-dependent chloride-bicarbonate exchanger (NDCBE) are responsible for the maintenance of the pHi. These transporters are important regulators of the pHi in both healthy and malignant cells and show higher expression and activity in tumors. Aim of this doctoral thesis is the analysis of the expression of the transporters NHE1, NHE5, MCT1, MCT4, MCT5 and NDCBE in human glioblastoma samples.

On the synthesis of tetradentate ligands,"A modular pathway for the preparation of tetradentate ligands was developed by employment of the nitroaldol reaction (Henry-reaction). Due to the use of basic solids as catalysts, namely the hydrotalcite Syntal 696® and the anion exchange resin Amberlyst A21®, the reactions proceeded at room temperature and the products were obtained by simple work-up procedures. Furthermore, NMR investigations and single crystal X-ray diffraction revealed the stereoselectivity of the developed pathway. In the course of functional group interchanges, the employment of protecting groups was necessary. Protection with trialkylsilyl groups was easily and diastereoselectively achieved. The coordination behavior towards zinc chloride was studied as well as the catalytic activity of a custom-tailored vanadium(V) complex towards sulfoxidation. Moreover, the coordination behavior of carbonyl analogous Schiff-bases towards zinc chloride were examined.

Technical optimization of biogas plants to deliver demand oriented power,"The increasing share of alternating renewable energies introduces the necessity of flexible power. Biogas plants can provide this, but are currently designed to provide base load.

Approximation algorithms for network design problems,"We consider different variants of network design problems. Given a set of points in the plane we search for a shortest interconnection of them. In this general formulation the problem is known as Steiner tree problem. We consider the special case of octilinear Steiner trees in the presence of hard and soft obstacles. In an octilinear Steiner tree the line segments connecting the points are allowed to run either in horizontal, vertical or diagonal direction. An obstacle is a connected region in the plane bounded by a simple polygon. No line segment of an octilinear Steiner tree is allowed to lie in the interior of a hard obstacle. If we intersect a Steiner tree with the interior of a soft obstacle, no connected component of the induced subtree is allowed to be longer than a given fixed length. We provide polynomial time approximation schemes for the octilinear Steiner tree problem in the presence of hard and soft obstacles. These were the first presented approximation schemes introduced for the problems. Additionally, we introduce a (2+epsilon)-approximation algorithm for soft obstacles. We then turn to Euclidean group Steiner trees. Instead of a set of fixed points we get for each point a set of potential locations (combined into groups) and we need to pick only one location of each group.

Funktionelle Charakterisierung des Komplex I sowie strukturelle Untersuchungen an verwandten Enzymen,"['Zusammenfassung: The NADH:Ubiquinone Oxidoreductase, the respiratory complex I, is the first and largest enzyme of the oxidative phosphorylation. Complex I catalyzes the transfer of two electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, which is coupled to the translocation of four protons across the membrane. It has a molecular mass of 550 kDa and is built up by 14 Subunits in prokaryotes, which are assembled in a peripheral and a membrane bound arm. The complex harbours a flavin mononucleotide and up to 10 iron-sulphur (Fe/S)-cluster as cofactors for electron transfer. The crystal structure of complex I from Thermus thermophilus was recently published at a resolution of 3.3 Å. Under evolutionary perspective the complex is built up by three large modules for electron transfer and proton translocation. In this work, a stable , clean and homogenous preparation of Escherichia coli complex I should be established. The effect of different mutations and inhibitors on the electron transfer and proton translocation activity should be determined. Homologs and analogs of modules of the complex from other organisms should be produced, isolated and characterized in order to derive perceptions about the mechanism of the complex. From an overproducing strain a preparation was developed which according to SDS -PAGE contained no contamination by other proteins, but was not stable for more than 8 days by addition of certain additives. In the preparation aggregates were detected which prevented the crystallization. Various lipids bind with high affinities to the delipidated complex I, suggesting specific binding sites. It has been shown that the electrostatic repulsion of E183 is mainly responsible for the discrimination of NADH and NADPH as substrate. It is believed that E95F is responsible for the ""eject  mechanism” for NAD+ . The coupling of electron transfer with the proton has been studied bythe inhibition of the complex with Zn2+. In this work it is shown that complex I contains two high-affinity binding sites for Zn2+ which are probably located at the periplasmic and the cytosolic side of the proton channels. The data lead to a model in which the reduction of the distal Fe/S-cluster induces a conformational change that is coupled to the opening and closing of proton channels in the membrane arm', 'Zusammenfassung: Die NADH:Ubichinon Oxidoreduktase, der respiratorische Komplex I, ist das erste und größte Enzym der oxidativen Phosphorylierung.

Er hat eine molekulare Masse von 550 kDa und wird in Prokaryoten von 14 Untereinheiten aufgebaut, die in einem peripheren und einem Membranarm assembliert sind. Der Komplex trägt ein Flavinmononukleotid (FMN) und bis zu 10 Eisen-Schwefel (Fe/S)-Zentren als Kofaktoren für den Elektronentransfer. Die Kristallstruktur des Komplex I aus Thermus thermophilus wurde kürzlich bei einer Auflösung von 3.3 Å veröffentlicht. Evolutionär setzt sich der Komplex aus drei großen Modulen für den Elektronentransfer und die Protonentranslokation zusammen. In dieser Arbeit sollte eine stabile, saubere und homogene Präparation des Escherichia coli Komplex I etabliert werden. Der Effekt verschiedener Mutationen und Inhibitoren auf die Elektronentransfer- und Protonentranslokations-Aktivität sollte bestimmt werden. Homologe und Analoge von Modulen des Komplex aus anderen Organismen sollten produziert, präpariert und charakterisiert werden, um durch vergleichende Analysen Aussagen über den Mechanismus des Komplexes abzuleiten.

Engineering highly efficient NADP-dependent formate dehydrogenases using a NADPH biosensor Escherichia coli strain,"NADPH is an essential cofactor that drives biosynthetic reactions in all living organisms. It is a reducing agent and thus electron donor of anabolic reactions that produce major cellular components as well as many products in biotechnology. Indeed, the engineering of metabolic pathways for the production of many products is often limited by the availability of NADPH. One common strategy to address this issue is to swap cofactor specificity from NADH to NADPH of enzymes. However, this process is time consuming and challenging because multiple parameters need to be engineered in parallel. Therefore, the first aim of this project is to establish an efficient metabolic biosensor to select enzymes that can reduce NADP+. An NADPH auxotroph strain was constructed by deleting major reactions involved in NADPH biosynthesis in E. coli’s central carbon metabolism with the exception of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase.

Optical frequency comb generation in optical fibres,"Optical frequency combs (OFC) constitute an array of phase-correlated equidistant spectral lines with nearly equal intensities over a broad spectral range. The adaptations of combs generated in mode-locked lasers proved to be highly efficient for the calibration of high-resolution (resolving power > 50000) astronomical spectrographs. The observation of different galaxy structures or the studies of the Milky Way are done using instruments in the low- and medium resolution range. To such instruments belong, for instance, the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) being developed for the Very Large Telescope (VLT) of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) and the 4-metre Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope (4MOST) being in development for the ESO VISTA 4.1 m Telescope. The existing adaptations of OFC from mode-locked lasers are not resolvable by these instruments. Within this work, a fibre-based approach for generation of OFC specifically in the low- and medium resolution range is studied numerically. This approach consists of three optical fibres that are fed by two equally intense continuous-wave (CW) lasers. The first fibre is a conventional single-mode fibre, the second one is a suitably pumped amplifying Erbium-doped fibre with anomalous dispersion, and the third one is a low-dispersion highly nonlinear optical fibre. The evolution of a frequency comb in this system is governed by the following processes: as the two initial CW-laser waves with different frequencies propagate through the first fibre, they generate an initial comb via a cascade of four-wave mixing processes. The frequency components of the comb are phase-correlated with the original laser lines and have a frequency spacing that is equal to the initial laser frequency separation (LFS), i.e. the difference in the laser frequencies. In the time domain, a train of pre-compressed pulses with widths of a few pico-seconds arises out of the initial bichromatic deeply-modulated cosine-wave. These pulses undergo strong compression in the subsequent amplifying Erbium-doped fibre: sub-100 fs pulses with broad OFC spectra are formed. In the following low-dispersion highly nonlinear fibre, the OFC experience a further broadening and the intensity of the comb lines are fairly equalised. This approach was mathematically modelled by means of a Generalised Nonlinear Schrödinger Equation (GNLS) that contains terms describing the nonlinear optical Kerr effect, the delayed Raman response, the pulse self-steepening, and the linear optical losses as well as the wavelength-dependent Erbium gain profile for the second fibre. The initial condition equation being a deeply-modulated cosine-wave mimics the radiation of the two initial CW lasers. The numerical studies are performed with the help of Matlab scripts that were specifically developed for the integration of the GNLS and the initial condition according to the proposed approach for the OFC generation. The scripts are based on the Fourth-Order Runge-Kutta in the Interaction Picture Method (RK4IP) in combination with the local error method. This work includes the studies and results on the length optimisation of the first and the second fibre depending on different values of the group-velocity dispersion of the first fibre. Such length optimisation studies are necessary because the OFC have the biggest possible broadband and exhibit a low level of noise exactly at the optimum lengths. Further, the optical pulse build-up in the first and the second fibre was studied by means of the numerical technique called Soliton Radiation Beat Analysis (SRBA). It was shown that a common soliton crystal state is formed in the first fibre for low laser input powers. The soliton crystal continuously dissolves into separated optical solitons as the input power increases. The pulse formation in the second fibre is critically dependent on the features of the pulses formed in the first fibre. I showed that, for low input powers, an adiabatic soliton compression delivering low-noise OFC occurs in the second fibre. At high input powers, the pulses in the first fibre have more complicated structures which leads to the pulse break-up in the second fibre with a subsequent degradation of the OFC noise performance. The pulse intensity noise studies that were performed within the framework of this thesis allow making statements about the noise performance of an OFC. They showed that the intensity noise of the whole system decreases with the increasing value of LFS.",gnd:7633313-9 gnd:4167589-7 gnd:4143252-6
Building urban resilience through spatial planning following disasters : the great East Japan earthquake and Tsunami,"It is expected that the changing temperatures and rising sea levels caused through global climate change will result in an aggravation of disaster risks (e.g. from heat stress, storms, flooding, landslides, air pollution, drought and water scarcity), particularly in urban areas (IPCC, 2014). This trend is exaggerated by the continuing trend of urbanization, which is projected to result in 66% of the people worldwide to live in cities in 2050 (United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division, 2014, p. 1). It is an important obligation of spatial planners to facilitate that this urban development follows certain standards, including safe housing and the provision of basic utilities and infrastructure as well as adequate health services (PreventionWeb, 2015; United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division, 2014). Resilience is one of the key concepts to address these challenges. If a city is resilient, it is able to “resist, absorb, accommodate to and recover from the effects of a hazard in a timely and efficient manner, including through the preservation and restoration of its essential basic structures and functions” (UNISDR, 2009, p. 24). The adjustment of existing urban structures is time-consuming and cost-intensive; therefore, a resilient city can most efficiently be achieved when it is first developed (UN-Habitat, 2015) or after a disaster has erased the previously existing city structures (Olshansky, Hopkins, & Johnson, 2012). The time frame after the disaster can be considered as a window of opportunity for planners to build the city back better or – in other words – to build a resilient city. Although the relevance of spatial planners for the construction of resilient cities is obvious, there is little knowledge of spatial planning’s capabilities to achieve this goal so far. Drawing from experiences on the reconstruction process after the Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami 2011 in Japan’s Miyako City and Ishinomaki City, this dissertation addresses this topic. It explains which of the local spatial planning options can be used to build resilience and how the toolkit of spatial planners can be improved in order to be more efficient to build urban resilience. Even through these spatial planning options differ from country to country and the focus of this work on Japan only enables a limited transferability of the research results, the experiences from Tohoku Region are able to contribute to the ongoing discussion about spatial planning and urban resilience after disasters.",gnd:4041387-1 gnd:4048590-0 gnd:4121590-4 gnd:4817917-6

Therefore, physiological factors, which may affect drug release from solid oral dosage forms in the fed stomach, have been investigated in detail in the present work. For this purpose, a biorelevant dissolution test device (Fed Stomach Model, FSM) has been developed. The FSM was designed as a flow-through system that allowed the biorelevant simulation of dosage form movement in stomach, intragastric pressures as well as gastric media flow. The functionality and applicability of the FSM was demonstrated using a bi-layer modified release tablet containing diclofenac sodium. The regional characteristics of the stomach in terms of mechanical stresses were taken into account in the form of test programs specific for fundus, antrum and gastric emptying. Furthermore, based on the results of a Magnetic Marker Monitoring study, these test programs were combined in different sequences in three test scenarios. In this manner, different deposition patterns of solid oral dosage forms in the fed stomach could be mimicked. Depending on the test scenario, different drug release rates were observed. The simulation of mild stresses in the fundus led to relatively low release rates.

Signatures of quantum vacuum nonlinearity in two-beam laser collisions,"One of the many astonishing predictions of quantum field theory is the nonlinear nature of the quantum vacuum. In the context of quantum electrodynamics this enables classically forbidden, nonlinear interactions between electromagnetic fields in the vacuum. One much pursued idea to test this prediction is to excite the quantum vacuum with high-intensity laser pulses to emit signal photons that can be distinguished from the driving laser photons, for example, by their polarization or photon energy. A major experimental challenge is the small number of signal photons compared to the background photons. With the aim of identifying a potential discovery experiment of quantum vacuum nonlinearity, we provide theoretically firm predictions for two different quantum vacuum signatures with an emphasize on experimentally feasible setups. This covers on the one side the much studied effect of vacuum birefringence, for which we analyze an innovative setup using a single X-ray free-electron laser. Special attention is paid to the influence of the optical components in the setup on the laser pulse properties. On the other side, we perform an in-depth study of a signature of quantum vacuum nonlinearity that has received less attention so far, namely laser photon merging. The signal photons here have the outstanding property that they differ in photon energy from the background photons and can thus be isolated efficiently. We show that, using state-of-the-art technology, the merging signal can compete with the vacuum birefringence signal in terms of its suitability for a potential discovery experiment of quantum vacuum nonlinearity.",gnd:4047984-5 gnd:4047982-1 gnd:4130722-7 gnd:4234583-2
"Analysis of supramolecular assemblies of NE81, the first lamin protein in a non-metazoan organism","Nuclear lamins are nucleus-specific intermediate filaments forming a network located at the inner nuclear membrane of the nuclear envelope. They form the nuclear lamina together with proteins of the inner nuclear membrane regulating nuclear shape and gene expression, among others. The amoebozoan Dictyostelium NE81 protein is a suitable candidate for an evolutionary conserved lamin protein in this non-metazoan organism. It shares the domain organization of metazoan lamins and is fulfilling major lamin functions in Dictyostelium. Moreover, field-emission scanning electron microscopy (feSEM) images of NE81 expressed on Xenopus oocytes nuclei revealed filamentous structures with an overall appearance highly reminiscent to that of metazoan Xenopus lamin B2. For the classification as a lamin-like or a bona fide lamin protein, a better understanding of the supramolecular NE81 structure was necessary. Yet, NE81 carrying a large N-terminal GFP-tag turned out as unsuitable source for protein isolation and characterization; GFP-NE81 expressed in Dictyostelium NE81 knock-out cells exhibited an abnormal distribution, which is an indicator for an inaccurate assembly of GFP-tagged NE81.

Experiments on synthetic dimensions in photonics,"The first and introductory section of the dissertation presents the working principle of a one- and two-dimensional photonic mesh lattice based on the time-multiplexing technique. The basis of a random walk interrelated to the corresponding light and quantum walk is comprehensively discussed as well. The second part of the dissertation consists of three experiments on a one-dimensional photonic mesh lattice. Firstly, the Kapitza-based guiding light project models the Kapitza potential as a continuous Pauli-Schrödinger-like equation and presents an experimental observation of light localization when the transverse modulation is bell-shaped but with a vanishing average along the propagation direction. Secondly, the optical thermodynamics project experimentally demonstrates for the first time that any given initial modal occupancy reaches thermal equilibrium by following a Rayleigh-Jeans distribution when propagates through a multimodal photonic mesh lattice with weak nonlinearity. Remarkably, the final modal occupancy possesses a unique temperature and chemical potential that have nothing to do with the actual thermal environment. Finally, the quantum interference project discusses an experimental all-optical architecture based on a coupled-fiber loop for generating and processing time-bin entangled single-photon pairs. Besides, it shows coincidence-to-accidental ratio and quantum interference measurements relying on the phase modulation of those time bins. The third part of the dissertation comprises two experiments on a two-dimensional photonic mesh lattice. The first project discusses the experimental realization of a two-dimensional mesh lattice employing short- and long-range interaction. To some extent, the second project presents a nonconservative system based on a two-dimensional photonic mesh lattice exploiting parity-time (PT) symmetry.",gnd:4279477-8 gnd:4059827-5
Zur biomechanischen Belastung von Insassen im mittleren Fahrzeug bei Dreier-Auffahrkollisionen,"[""A goal of this study was the systematic identification of biomechanical stress acting on the occupants in regard of the cervical spine with the newly defined sandwichcollision. This describes a rear-end collision of a vehicle with a second vehicle in front of it, which is pushed onto a third vehicle, which is in front of the second vehicle, in turn. The second vehicle's, thus the middle of the three vehicles, occupants' movement was of interest and was calculated on the basis of 36 simulations and compared to 34 simulated head-on collisions. The simulation calculations using PC-Crash and Madymo showed that, while at the same collision-related velocity change, the vehicle involved in a sandwichcollision induces a significantly higher biomechanical stress to which the vehicle occupant was exposed than a head-on collision considered in isolation. This occurred at a gap of 80 cm and less between the front and the middle vehicle. These gaps are typically exceeded, but can fall short of in hazardous situations too. For the quantification of the biomechanical stress the differential speed between head and torso during the deceleration phase after the rear-end collision at the head-on collision was evaluated. By this differential speed shearing motions between head and torso can be explained. As a result the so defined biomechanical frontal stress in the event of a sandwichcollision by the overlap of the rebound-movement of the rear-end collision with the head-on collision exceeds ..."", 'Halswirbelsäule, Halswirbelsäulenverletzung, Verkehrsunfall, Schleudertrauma, Sandwich-Kollision, Auffahrunfall, Auffahrkollision, Biomechanische Belastung']",gnd:4143385-3 gnd:4023095-8 gnd:4062983-1 gnd:4129197-9 gnd:4006880-8 gnd:4129196-7
Extended diffuse radio emission in merging galaxy clusters,"Galaxy clusters are the most massive gravitationally bound systems in the universe which grow through mergers with other clusters, galaxy groups, and accretion of gas. The mergers generate shocks and turbulence in the intra-cluster medium (ICM). Along the shock edges, particles are accelerated to relativistic energies through multiple crossings at the shock front. The extended diffuse emission sources formed as a result are commonly classified as radio halos and radio relics. The precise nature and origin of the relativistic particles is nevertheless not well understood. We study the nature of the radio relic candidate in Abell 115. We obtain it's spectral properties using radio continuum observations at 150\,MHz with LOFAR, 610\,MHz with the GMRT, and 1.5\,GHz with the VLA. We confirm it's nature as a radio relic. Polarization analyses suggest that part of the large scale synchrotron source is embedded in a region of high ICM density. We show that the galaxy cluster A1430 hosts a two-component radio halo using observations at 150\,MHz with LOFAR. We obtain the spectral index of the radio halo and derive estimates of the radio power at 1.4 GHz. We also show that a part of the radio halo could be produced via turbulence and the rest lies in a region compressed by the merger via adiabatic compression. Using a 100-m single dish radio telescope, we observe the galaxy clusters PSZ1-G108, Abell 746, 0809+39, and Abell 1367. We detected the polarised flux at 4.85 GHz in all the sources that were previously labelled as radio relics. The radio spectra of the integreted emission below 4.85 GHz can be well fitted with a single power law for all the radio relics. Polarisation observations of radio synchrotron sources offer a method of measuring the strength and geometry of the shock front. The observations of the galaxy clusters PSZ1-G108, Abell 746, 0809+39, and Abell 1367 show that radio relics' spectral properties are well represented by a single power-law below 5GHz.",gnd:4184235-2 gnd:4057760-0 gnd:4201989-8 gnd:4046482-9 gnd:4048204-2 gnd:4244847-5 gnd:4117265-6

Stalk structures in lipid bilayer fusion studied by x-ray diffraction,"The fusion of two biological membranes is an important step in many processes on the cellular and sub-cellular level. Understanding the involved interplay of different lipid species, a specialized protein machinery and water on length scales of few nanometers poses a significant challenge to current structural biology. Among several complementary approaches, one strategy is to study the structural rearrangements of the lipid matrix. As the initial step, lipid bilayers must be forced into close contact to form a non-bilayer intermediate termed a stalk. This has been the subject of numerous theoretical studies and simulations, but experimental data on stalks are largely lacking. Currently, the only way to obtain structural information at the required sub-nanometer resolution is x-ray diffraction on the recently discovered stalk phaseʺ formed by certain lipids. We apply this method to elucidate the effect of lipid composition on stalk geometry and the repulsive forces between lipid bilayers prior to stalk formation. An approach based on differential geometry of electron density isosurfaces is introduced to analyze the curvatures and bending energies of the lipid monolayers. For the first time, this connects experiment-based structures of stalks and the associated bending and hydration energies. In addition, this thesis aims to provide a self-contained introduction to the required background in x-ray diffraction on lipid mesophases and electron density reconstruction.",gnd:4210049-5 gnd:4167790-0
Beitrag zur Entwicklung eines offenen Absorptionskreisprozesses zur Wärmerückgewinnung bei Biomasserauchgasen,"['The flue gas of biomass boilers has a great potential of latent heat, which will be lost to the environment. That is one reason to a low thermal efficiency of biomass combustion plants.

This thesis deals with the opportunity to use this heat for district heating or other applications. At a pilot plant for natural gas flue gas energetic and exergetic calculations and experiments on dif-ferent working pairs were carried out. Furthermore a pilot plant for biomass flue gases was built and put into operation.

Multimodal-nonlinear-optical-microspectroscopy for biological and diagnostic applications,"Multimodal non-linear imaging techniques provide non-invasive and potentially in vivo means to investigate tissue with cellular resolution. A particularly promising approach that has garnered attention as of late is the combination of coherent antiStokes Raman scattering (CARS), second harmonic generation (SHG) and two photon excited autofluorescence (TPEF) microscopy. In the first section of this thesis, the diagnostic potential of multimodal non-linear imaging has been demonstrated in the case of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. The second part of this thesis investigates the feasibility of CARS microscopy for imaging intense bands in the finger-print region (800-1800 cm−1) wherein the presence of multiple overlapping peaks and interference with non-resonant background present challenges.

Ruthenium(II) Terpyridyl complexes featuring donor and acceptor moieties,"In the last decades, tremendous research has been focused on the conversion of solar energy into chemical energy (i.e., photocatalysis). Hereby, scientists tried to mimic the fundamental processes in natural photosynthesis (i.e., light-harvesting, photoinduced charge separation, charge accumulation and multielectron catalysis), in order to prepare artificial photosynthetic devices. The thesis describes the synthesis and characterization of photoactive assemblies based on ruthenium(II) 2,2':6',2''-terpyridyl complexes that are capable of light-harvesting and photoinduced charge separation. It is shown that the remarkable customizability of terpyridine ligands in 4'-position and readily coordination to ruthenium centers enables a rapid access to highly functionalized complexes. The latter are equipped with organosulfurs as electron donors and fullerenes or polyoxometalates as electron acceptors and the donor-acceptor distance was varied by incorporation of spacer units. The systems can be considered as linear molecular triads with the complex as central light absorbing photosensitizer. Upon visible light excitation, two electron transfer processes involving the donor and acceptor units are observed and result in a long-ranged charge separated state. The lifetime of the charge separation increases with the donor-acceptor distance and is multiple times higher than the lifetime of the excited state, which reflects the effectivity of the photosensitizer. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that light-harvesting antennae systems can be obtained via linkage of iridium(III) and ruthenium(II) complexes. The dinuclear complexes feature enhanced absorptivity and in addition, the light which is absorbed by iridium complex is efficiently transferred to the ruthenium complex.",gnd:4386873-3 gnd:4266702-1
Balkan pathologies of modernity : the national question between consensus and conflict,"['The possibility of thinking and criticising modernity and modern law lies at the heart of this work.

Analytical Modeling of Self-Healing and Super Healing in Cementitious Materials,"Self-healing materials have recently become more popular due to their capability to autonomously and autogenously repair the damage in cementitious materials. The concept of self-healing gives the damaged material the ability to recover its stiffness. This gives a difference in comparing with a material that is not subjected to healing. Once this material is damaged, it cannot sustain loading due to the stiffness degradation. Numerical modeling of self-healing materials is still in its infancy. Multiple experimental researches were conducted in literature to describe the behavior of self-healing of cementitious materials. However, few numerical investigations were undertaken. The thesis presents an analytical framework of self-healing and super healing materials based on continuum damage-healing mechanics. Through this framework, we aim to describe the recovery and strengthening of material stiffness and strength. A simple damage healing law is proposed and applied on concrete material. The proposed damage-healing law is based on a new time-dependent healing variable. The damage-healing model is applied on isotropic concrete material at the macroscale under tensile load. Both autonomous and autogenous self-healing mechanisms are simulated under different loading conditions. These two mechanisms are denoted in the present work by coupled and uncoupled self-healing mechanisms, respectively. We assume in the coupled self-healing that the healing occurs at the same time with damage evolution, while we assume in the uncoupled self-healing that the healing occurs when the material is deformed and subjected to a rest period (damage is constant). In order to describe both coupled and uncoupled healing mechanisms, a one-dimensional element is subjected to different types of loading history. In the same context, derivation of nonlinear self-healing theory is given, and comparison of linear and nonlinear damage-healing models is carried out using both coupled and uncoupled self-healing mechanisms. The nonlinear healing theory includes generalized nonlinear and quadratic healing models. The healing efficiency is studied by varying the values of the healing rest period and the parameter describing the material characteristics. In addition, theoretical formulation of different self-healing variables is presented for both isotropic and anisotropic maerials. The healing variables are defined based on the recovery in elastic modulus, shear modulus, Poisson's ratio, and bulk modulus. The evolution of the healing variable calculated based on cross-section as function of the healing variable calculated based on elastic stiffness is presented in both hypotheses of elastic strain equivalence and elastic energy equivalence. The components of the fourth-rank healing tensor are also obtained in the case of isotropic elasticity, plane stress and plane strain. Recent research revealed that self-healing presents a crucial solution also for the strengthening of the materials. This new concept has been termed ``Super Healing``. Once the stiffness of the material is recovered, further healing can result as a strengthening material. In the present thesis, new theory of super healing materials is defined in isotropic and anisotropic cases using sound mathematical and mechanical principles which are applied in linear and nonlinear super healing theories. Additionally, the link of the proposed theory with the theory of undamageable materials is outlined. In order to describe the super healing efficiency in linear and nonlinear theories, the ratio of effective stress to nominal stress is calculated as function of the super healing variable. In addition, the hypotheses of elastic strain and elastic energy equivalence are applied. In the same context, new super healing matrix in plane strain is proposed based on continuum damage-healing mechanics. In the present work, we also focus on numerical modeling of impact behavior of reinforced concrete slabs using the commercial finite element package Abaqus/Explicit. Plain and reinforced concrete slabs of unconfined compressive strength 41 MPa are simulated under impact of ogive-nosed hard projectile. The constitutive material modeling of the concrete and steel reinforcement bars is performed using the Johnson-Holmquist-2 damage and the Johnson-Cook plasticity material models, respectively. Damage diameters and residual velocities obtained by the numerical model are compared with the experimental results and effect of steel reinforcement and projectile diameter is studied.",gnd:4190685-8 gnd:4125902-6 gnd:4273137-9
Group Navigation in Multi-User Virtual Reality,"Multi-user virtual reality systems enable collocated as well as distributed users to perform collaborative activities in immersive virtual environments. A common activity in this context is to move from one location to the next as a group to explore the environment together. The simplest solution to realize these multi-user navigation processes is to provide each participant with a technique for individual navigation. However, this approach entails some potentially undesirable consequences such as the execution of a similar navigation sequence by each participant, a regular need for coordination within the group, and, related to this, the risk of losing each other during the navigation process. To overcome these issues, this thesis performs research on group navigation techniques that move group members together through a virtual environment. The presented work was guided by four overarching research questions that address the quality requirements for group navigation techniques, the differences between collocated and distributed settings, the scalability of group navigation, and the suitability of individual and group navigation for various scenarios. This thesis approaches these questions by introducing a general conceptual framework as well as the specification of central requirements for the design of group navigation techniques. The design, implementation, and evaluation of corresponding group navigation techniques demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework. As a first step, this thesis presents ideas for the extension of the short-range teleportation metaphor, also termed jumping, for multiple users. It derives general quality requirements for the comprehensibility of the group jumping process and introduces a corresponding technique for two collocated users. The results of two user studies indicate that sickness symptoms are not affected by user roles during group jumping and confirm improved planning accuracy for the navigator, increased spatial awareness for the passenger, and reduced cognitive load for both user roles. Next, this thesis explores the design space of group navigation techniques in distributed virtual environments. It presents a conceptual framework to systematize the design decisions for group navigation techniques based on Tuckman's model of small-group development and introduces the idea of virtual formation adjustments as part of the navigation process. A quantitative user study demonstrates that the corresponding extension of Multi-Ray Jumping for distributed dyads leads to more efficient travel sequences and reduced workload. The results of a qualitative expert review confirm these findings and provide further insights regarding the complementarity of individual and group navigation in distributed virtual environments. Then, this thesis investigates the navigation of larger groups of distributed users in the context of guided museum tours and establishes three central requirements for (scalable) group navigation techniques. These should foster the awareness of ongoing navigation activities as well as facilitate the predictability of their consequences for all group members (Comprehensibility), assist the group with avoiding collisions in the virtual environment (Obstacle Avoidance), and support placing the group in a meaningful spatial formation for the joint observation and discussion of objects (View Optimization). The work suggests a new technique to address these requirements and reports on its evaluation in an initial usability study with groups of five to ten (partially simulated) users.

Particle-in-cell simulations of perpendicular supernova shock fronts,"The origin of cosmic rays was the subject of several studies for over a century. The investigations done within this dissertation are one small step to shed some more light on this mystery. Locating the sources of cosmic rays is not trivial due to the interstellar magnetic field. However, the Hillas criterion allows us to arrive at the conclusion that supernova remnants are our main suspect for the origin of galactic cosmic rays. The mechanism by which they are accelerating particles is found within the field of shock physics as diffusive shock acceleration. To allow particles to enter this process also known as Fermi acceleration pre-acceleration processes like shock surfing acceleration and shock drift acceleration are necessary. Investigating the processes happening in the plasma shocks of supernova remnants is possible by utilising a simplified model which can be simulated on a computer using Particle-in-Cell simulations. We developed a new and clean setup to simulate the formation of a double shock, i.e., consisting of a forward and a reverse shock and a contact discontinuity, by the collision of two counter-streaming plasmas, in which a magnetic field can be woven into. In a previous work, we investigated the processes at unmagnetised and at magnetised parallel shocks, whereas in the current work, we move our investigation on to magnetised perpendicular shocks. Due to a much stronger confinement of the particles to the collision region the perpendicular shock develops much faster than the parallel shock. On the other hand, this leads to much weaker turbulence. We are able to find indications for shock surfing acceleration and shock drift acceleration happening at the two shocks leading to populations of pre-accelerated particles that are suitable as a seed population to be injected into further diffusive shock acceleration to be accelerated to even higher energies. We observe the development of filamentary structures in the shock ramp of the forward shock, but not at the reverse shock. This leads to the conclusion that the development of such structures in the shock ramp of quasi-perpendicular collisionless shocks might not necessarily be determined by the existence of a critical sonic Mach number but by a critical shock speed. The results of the investigations done within this dissertation might be useful for further studies of oblique shocks and for studies using hybrid or magnetohydrodynamic simulations. Together with more sophisticated observational methods, these studies will help to bring us closer to an answer as to how particles can be accelerated in supernova remnants and eventually become cosmic rays that can be detected on Earth.",gnd:4046249-3 gnd:4204838-2 gnd:4057760-0
"Fluoreszierendes gelöstes organisches Material (FDOM) in Küstenmeeren : Charakterisierung, biogeochemische Prozesse, und die Möglichkeit der in situ Überwachung","['Marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a major player in global biogeochemical cycles. Here, DOM was studied for the first time with optical and molecular methods in a subterranean estuary (STE) and it was compared to a surface estuary, both in Florida, USA. I hypothesized that STEs are important sources of DOM to the coastal ocean. I developed novel statistical tools for multivariate data interpretation. As a main result, I could show that coastal sediments are major sources of DOM to the coastal ocean. In the surface estuary, mixing of fresh- and seawater was the main driver for DOM concentration and composition, while in the STE microbial processing dominated over mixing. By statistically combining the results from ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry (Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry, FT-ICR-MS), fluorescence spectroscopy and other chemical water analysis, I identified major DOM sources in the two estuarine systems.

This question, which has received little attention in the transformation narratives of the 20th century, lies at the heart of this book. Building on network theory and insights from research literature on empires, the book develops a model that can explain disintegration processes of imperial—in network theoretical terms: ‘star-shaped’—orders. This model is then tested in two detailed case studies on the decolonisation of the Eastern Bloc after World War II and the collapse of its socialist order.The author demonstrates that local elites on the peripheries of the respective orders played an important role in the processes of disintegration. He also shows that the ‘power’ and ‘idea’-based explanations that dominate discourse on transformations in international relations cannot be empirically juxtaposed.

Transition towards energy efficient machine tools,"Energy efficiency represents a cost-effective and immediate strategy of a sustainable development. Due to substantial environmental and economic implications, a strong emphasis is put on the electrical energy requirements of machine tools for metalworking processes. The improvement of energy efficiency is however confronted with diverse barriers, which sustain an energy efficiency gap of unexploited potential. The deficiencies lie in the lack of information about the actual energy requirements of machine tools, a minimum energy reference to quantify improvement potential and the possible actions to improve the energy demand. Therefore, a comprehensive concept for energy performance management of machine tools is developed which guides the transition towards energy efficient machine tools. It is structured in four innovative concept modules, which are embedded into step-by-step workflow models. The capability of the performance management concept is demonstrated in an automotive manufacturing environment. The target audience primarily comprises researchers and practitioners challenged to enhance energy efficiency in manufacturing.

Existing sequence based tools prediction such binding sites do not consider their actual functionality, although it is known that besides the base sequence many other aspects are relevant for binding and for the effects of that binding. In particular in Eukaryotes a perfectly matching sequence motif is neither necessary nor sufficient for a functional transcription factor binding site.

Plant and soil related effects on the soil microbial community composition and soil microbial carbon dynamics,"Soil microorganisms are key mediators of soil carbon (C) cycling; however several plant and soil related factors potentially influence the functions of soil microbial communities. In that sense, this thesis describes 3 studies which provide new knowledge of factors that influence processes mediated by soil microorganisms. This thesis focused in understanding 1) the mechanisms behind the plant diversity effect on the C transfer from above to belowground; 2) the influence of plant diversity on different soil microbial groups, soil bacterial diversity and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) markers evenness; and 3) the relative importance of the combined effects of soil type, seasonal changes and vegetation type. The results demonstrated that plant diversity impacted soil microbial communities directly and indirectly. Root-associated microorganisms were favored directly by plant diversity via increased root biomass, which facilitated access of recently photosynthesized C for this microbial group. In contrast, soil-related microorganisms were favored indirectly by plant diversity. Likely, increased C resource input contributed to the development of soil-related microbial biomass in high plant diversity. Moreover, soil bacterial diversity increased with increasing plant diversity, whilst PLFA evenness decreased. Interestingly, at the highest plant diversity level, PLFAs indicative of root-associated microorganisms predominated; this indicated that plant diversity favors the cycling of recently photosynthesized C. In addition, changing root biomass in different soil types was an important mediator of C resource availability belowground. Whereas, differences in the type of C substrate, from fresh C rhizodeposits to plant litter, related to seasonal changes, were relevant for shaping the microbial community composition. Overall, this thesis contributes to strengthen the knowledge on the role of microbial communities in the C cycling belowground.",gnd:4007348-8 gnd:4164552-2 gnd:4039226-0
Study on magnetohydrodynamic turbulence and its astrophysical applications,"Turbulence and magnetic fields are ubiquitous in the Universe. Their importance to astronomy cannot be overestimated. The theoretical advancements in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence achieved during the past two decades have significantly influenced many fields of astronomy.

These fundamental non-linear problems were believed to be tractable only numerically. This book provides complete analytical descriptions in quantitative agreement with existing numerics, as well as theoretical predictions in physical regimes still unreachable by simulations, and explanations of various related observations. It also discusses and promotes the astrophysical applications of MHD turbulence theories, including (i) the particle acceleration and radiation in high-energy phenomena, e.g., Gamma-Ray Bursts, supernova remnants, cosmic rays; (ii) interstellar density fluctuations and the effect on observations, e.g., Faraday rotation, scattering measurements of Galactic and extragalactic radio sources; (iii) density and magnetic field structure in molecular clouds toward star formation.

Examination of the closedness of spaces of stochastic integrals,"['We study stochastic hedging concepts for a general semimartingale model in incompletemarkets.

This is a main contribution of this work. Using the closedness and a change of the according probability measure (using a so-called variance-minimizing martingale measure ~P) to transfer the problem to a (local) martingale setting then allows us, to determine explicit hedging strategies for the respective spaces.', 'Wir beschäftigen uns mit stochastischen Hedgingkonzepten in einem allgemeinen Semimartingal Modell.

Entropies of Condensed Phases and Complex Systems : A First Principles Approach,"Predicting thermodynamic quantities for chemically realistic systems on the basis of atomistic calculations is still, even today, a nontrivial task. Nonetheless, accurate treatment of inter-particle interactions, in terms of quantum chemical first principles methods, is a prerequisite for many applications, because of the complexity of both reactants and solvents in modern molecular sciences. Currently, a straightforward calculation of thermodynamic properties from these methods is only possible for high-temperature and low- density systems. Although the enthalpy of a system can often be predicted to a good level of precision with this ideal gas approach, calculating the entropy contribution to the free energy is problematic, especially as the density of the system increases. This thesis contains a compact and coherent introduction of basic theoretical features. The foundations are then laid for the development of approaches suitable for calculation of condensed phase entropies on the basis of well-established quantum chemical methods. The main emphasis of this work is on realistic systems in solution, which is the most important environment for chemical synthesis.

Heavy WIMP Effective Theory : Formalism and Applications for Scattering on Nucleon Targets,"[""This book is about dark matter’s particle nature and the implications of a new symmetry that appears when a hypothetical dark matter particle is heavy compared to known elementary particles. Dark matter exists and composes about 85% of the matter in the universe, but it cannot be explained in terms of the known elementary particles. Discovering dark matter's particle nature is one of the most pressing open problems in particle physics. This thesis derives the implications of a new symmetry that appears when the hypothetical dark matter particle is heavy compared to the known elementary particles, a situation which is well motivated by the null results of searches at the LHC and elsewhere. The new symmetry predicts a universal interaction between dark matter and ordinary matter, which in turn may be used to determine the event rate and detectable energy in dark matter direct detection experiments. The computation of heavy wino and higgsino dark matter presented in this work has become a benchmark for the field of direct detection. This thesis has also spawned a new field of investigation in dark matter indirect detection, determining heavy WIMP annihilation rates using effective field theory methods. It describes a new formalism for implementing Lorentz invariance constraints in nonrelativistic theories, with a surprising result at 1/M^4 order that contradicts the prevailing ansatz in the past 20 years of heavy quark literature.

Quantum localisation phenomena induced by disorder or interactions,"Abstract: In this thesis we give a rather descriptive presentation of the results obtained on the theoretical analysis of different probing techniques of localisation in quantum systems, and their implications. Detailed procedures and technical discussions can be found in the list of selected publications attached at the end of the manuscript. <br><br>Chapter 2 is devoted to disorder-induced localisation, in particular to numerical studies of the critical properties of the Anderson transition  in d=3 dimensions. There, we explain the meaning of multifractality at the critical point, its characterisation and its potential to provide an alternative perspective on the metal-to-insulator transition. We formalise a generalised multifractal analysis which exploits the persistence of multifractal fluctuations in the wavefunction around the transition. This approach is used to obtain high-precision estimates of critical parameters and multifractal exponents simultaneously in a combined analysis. <br><br>In Chapter 3 we treat the problem of localisation in interacting systems.

We explain why and how localisation is revealed by the behaviour of the inelastic scattering cross section.

Carboxylate-functionalized triphenylamine-based complexes : from discrete monomeric complexes to 2D and 3D extended frameworks,"The goal of this thesis is the variable functionalization of the redox-active triphenylamine molecule with carboxylate groups which is expected to lead to varying possibilities from monocarboxylates (which can be used to generate simple complexes) to tricarboxylates (which have potential in producing coordination polymers). Varying the substituents on the para-positions of the monocarboxyltriphenylamine ligands and then merging with Cu(II) ions results in discrete complexes bearing the well-known paddle wheel motif. However, while the nature of the p-substituents had no effect on the magnetic behaviour of the Cu(II) units in the complexes, their electrochemical properties showed strong dependency on the electronic nature of these substituents. In the case of the trifunctionalized ligand, it was possible to obtain extended 2D and 3D networks with Co(II) ions. Simply combining the ligand with Co(II) ions in DMF yielded two different anionic networks depending on the geometry of the pressure reactor utilized for the synthesis. Furthermore, adding terephthalic acid as second ligand led to the formation of a third anionic pillared-layer framework with cage-like cavities. The bulky dimethylammonium counterion in the networks formed from the decomposition of DMF were easily replaced using smaller inorganic cations leading to increased access to the pores as well as higher surface areas. Using isophthalic acid instead of terephthalic acid resulted in a neutral fourth network composed of carboxylate-bridged trinuclear clusters. The isophthalic acid is believed to have played only a templating role in the formation of the eventual framework. Overall, the main thrust of this thesis is the remarkable flexibility of the tricarboxytriphenylamine ligand, by which a simple variation of the conditions and precursors yields different results. Additionally, the stability of the charged frameworks offers a possibility to tune the porosity of the ensuing structures via simple guest-ion exchange.",gnd:4001590-7 gnd:4279323-3 gnd:4137334-0 gnd:4655088-4
Prokaryotic microorganisms in uranium mining waste piles and their interactions with uranium and other heavy metals,"The influence of uranyl and sodium nitrate under aerobic and anaerobic conditions on the microbial community structure of a soil sample from the uranium mining waste pile Haberland in Germany was studied by using the 16S rRNA gene retrieval.

The influence of iron (Fe) nutritional status on plant-pathogen interactions,"['The plant nutrients in particular Fe appears as a determinant of plant resistance as both, the pathogen and the host compete for Fe. However, there have been contradictory reports on whether a Fe-sufficient or Fe-deficient nutritional status of the plant is more beneficial for plant resistance. The present study investigated the role of Fe in plant defense in the maize-Colletotrichum graminicola and Arabidopsis-Colletotrichum higginsianum pathosystems. Fe-sufficient maize and Arabidopsis plants were more tolerant to Colletotrichum than Fe-deficient plants, indicating that Fe plays a positive role in plant defense. A strong temporal and spatial coincidence between H2O2 production and Fe recruitment to the infection site leads to the conclusion that in Fe-deficient leaves the delayed and less intense recruitment of Fe at early fungal growth stages was a major cause for a weaker oxidative burst, and hence, allowed more rapid fungal development and progression to the necrotrophic phase. Finally, the study using transgenic Arabidopsis lines showed that plant Fe homeostasis-related genes can influence the plant defense against pathogens.', 'Die Pflanzennährstoffe, insbesondere Fe erscheint als Determinante der Pflanzenresistenz, da beide, der Erreger und die Wirtspflanze für Fe konkurrieren. Jedoch gab es widersprüchliche Berichte darüber, ob ein ausreichender oder mangelnder Fe-Ernährungsstatus günstiger für das Pflanzenresistenz sein. Das vorliegende Studium untersuchte die Rolle von Fe in der Pflanzenabwehr in der Mais-Colletotrichum graminicola und Arabidopsis-Colletotrichum higginsianum Pathosystemen.

Zuverlässigkeit von keramischen Mehrlagensubstraten,"['This PhD thesis describes a reliability model for thick film resistors. Microcracks existing inside the resistor may grow due to mechanical stresses. Because of a high glass portion in the material, pronounced subcritical crack growth can be observed. Not the crack growth itself, but the resistance change caused by the crack growth leads to the failure of the resistor. The developed reliability model describes this functional failure of the resistor, taking into account statistically distributed input parameters. The result of the reliability calculation is the failure probability as a function of time. A calculation procedure for the time dependent failure probability, a finite element crack growth simulation, material characterisation methods for thick film materials and a verification experiment for the time dependent failure of the resistors is shown. The tolerance range of the calculated lifetimes is estimated by studying the influence of different input parameters. Due to the brittle material behaviour the lifetime of thick film resistors can only be calculated in the range of some orders of magnitude. For currently used thick film resistors under usual operating load conditions the failure probability is negligibly small.', 'Ein Zuverlässigkeitsmodell für Dickschichtwiderstände wird vorgestellt, welches die Widerstandsänderung aufgrund wachsender Mikrorisse beschreibt.

Past and present biodiversity in northeastern Siberia inferred from sedimentary DNA metabarcoding,"The arctic-boreal treeline is a transition zone from taiga to tundra covering a vast area in Siberia. It often features large environmental gradients and reacts sensitively to changes in the environment. For example, the expansion of shrubs and a northward movement of the treeline are observable in Siberia as a response to the warming climate. The changes in vegetation across the treeline are known to influence the water chemistry in the lakes. This causes further alteration to the composition and diversity of sensitive aquatic organisms such as diatoms and macrophytes. Despite the rising awareness of the complex climate-feedback mechanisms of terrestrial plants, the understanding of their assembly rules and about responses of aquatic biomes in the surrounding treeline lakes is still limited.

"Schnelle Wegsucheverfahren auf digitalen Straßenkarten -- Entwicklung, Implementierung und Anwendungsbeispiel bei einem Logistikdienstleister","[""The solution to many real-world transportation planning problems is combinatorially comprehensive, complex, and some of the necessary information is not available in a sufficiently structured form. Hence, standard solving methods are often not applicable. This holds for courier and express providers' operational dispatching, where vehicles are assigned to customer orders. Typically, dialog-oriented decision support systems (DSS) are used to generate recommendations from which a human dispatcher selects the most profitable one by means of domain-specific knowledge. In this process, solutions that consolidate the freight of multiple customer orders onto a single vehicle are usually particularly favorable. This work examines optimization of the dispatching process with particular attention to the potential of freight consolidation. In order to uncover possible savings by consolidating, many alternative vehicle routes need to be determined and compared with each other. For this purpose, fast routing algorithms are essential. These algorithms form the first focus of this work. Based on a comparative literature overview of classical'' as well as current routing algorithms, the center of attention is put on contraction hierarchies (CH) as they provide a particularly favorable ratio of query speed-up to additional memory requirement. Both optimizations of hierarchy creation and new enhancements for queries in CH are studied. The considerable merits of these approaches are empirically shown through extensive benchmarks on digital road maps provided by the OpenStreetMap project. More realistic routes are obtained when routing algorithms take turn restrictions into account. First, common approaches from literature are presented for this purpose. Next, the adaptive search is introduced as a more efficient new approach, and adjusted for usage in CH. The above-mentioned query enhancements can easily be applied to this method. The advantages of the adaptive search in CH over the edge-based search that is employed for turn restriction aware routing in earlier literature is emphasized by further benchmarks. For the second focus of this work --~the vehicle routing problem with freight consolidation~-- first, a thorough mathematical model is developed. Next, model assumptions are extracted from past operational real-world data provided by IN tIME Express Logistik GmbH. Eventually, the recursive savings algorithm is introduced as a heuristic that can generate freight consolidation recommendations in the context of a DSS. Employed in multiple benchmarks based upon the past operational data, it reveals considerable cost savings compared to former dispatching decisions."", 'Die Lösung vieler straßengebundener Transportplanungsprobleme aus der Praxis ist kombinatorisch aufwendig, komplex und manche der notwendigen Informationen liegen nicht hinreichend strukturiert vor.

Object-Oriented Modeling and Coordination of Mobile Robots,"...The main contribution of this work is an approach that allows the object-oriented modeling and coordination of mobile robots, supporting the cooperation of mobile manipulators. Within a mobile manipulator, the approach allows to define real-time reactions to sensor data and to synchronize the different actuators and sensors present, allowing sensor-aware combinations of motions for platform and arm. Moreover, the approach facilitates an easy way of programming, provides means to handle kinematic restrictions or redundancy, and supports advanced capabilities such as impedance control to mitigate position uncertainty. Working with multiple independent mobile robots, each has a different knowledge about its environment, based on the available sensors. These different views are modeled, allowing consistent coordination of robots in applications using the data available on each robot. To cope with geometric uncertainty, sensors are modeled and the relationship between their measurements and geometric aspects is defined. Based on these definitions and incoming sensor data, position estimates are automatically derived. Additionally, the more dynamic environment leads to different possible outcomes of task execution. These are explicitly modeled and can be used to define reactive behavior. The approach was successfully evaluated based on two application examples, ranging from physical interaction between two mobile manipulators handing over a work-piece to gesture control of a quadcopter for carrying goods.",gnd:7732064-5 gnd:4250471-5 gnd:4191911-7 gnd:4121677-5
Efficient activation of peroxymonosulfate by carbon-based catalysts for water purification,"The increasing global population has led to a growing demand for cost-effective and eco-friendly methods of water purification. This demand has reached a peak due to the increasing presence of impurities and pollutants in water and a growing awareness of waterborne diseases. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are effective methods to address these challenges, due to the generation of highly reactive radicals, such as sulfate radical (SO4•-), hydroxyl radical (•OH), and/or superoxide radical (•O2-) in oxidation reactions. Relative to conventional hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-based AOPs for wastewater treatment, the persulfate-related AOPs are receiving increasing attention over the past decades, due to their stronger oxidizing capability and a wider pH working window.

Extraction of bioactive primary and secondary metabolites from microalgae by atmospheric pressure plasmas and pulsed discharges in water,"['Microalgae are aquatic, unicellular, eukaryotic organisms, which perform photosynthesis. They have gained interest within the last decades not only for biofuel production due to their high amount of lipids, but also for pharmaceutical and for nutraceutical purposes. Interesting compounds are proteins, carbohydrates, or pigments, such as carotenoids. However, microalgae possess strong and rigid cell walls, which hinder a sufficient and yet, gentle extraction of those valuable compounds. Although standard extraction techniques are available, several shortcomings occur, e.g. high energy demand, use of environmentally harmful solvents or alteration of compounds due to heat or chemicals. Therefore, an alternative method is needed, which is able to address these disadvantages. Physical plasmas were thus studied to answer the question whether they are able to disintegrate the cell walls of microalgae effectively and yet, without degradation of the extractives. First step of the thesis was to find a suitable plasma source that has an effect on the cell walls because plasma effects, such as electric fields, shockwaves, UV light emission, and the generation of reactive species can be tailored with the respective setup. It was found that spark discharges are most effective for the extraction of Chlorella vulgaris, which was chosen as model organism.

"Synthesis of jasmonates and derivatives to study plant signaling : activation, translocation and shutdown mechanisms","Endogenous jasmonates (plant hormones) and synthetic derivatives were synthetized to study different aspects of plant signaling. In a first study, new evidence of the close relationship between the Ca2+- and JA- signaling pathways is provided. It is reported that the antibiotic neomycin selectively blocks the Ca2+ elevation induced by oral secretions of Spodoptera littoralis larvae and consequently inhibit the accumulation of the active jasmonate JA-Ile in the leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana plants. A second study uses a fluorinated mimic of the JA precursor OPC-8:0 as a molecular probe to study its metabolism in planta. The fluorinated compound and derived metabolites can be detected by UHPLC-MS/MS easily. The fluorinated OPC-8:0 can be translocated from damaged to undamaged systemic leaves. This result suggests that OPC-8:0 ─ in addition to JA and JA-Ile ─ may also contribute to propagate the mobile signal which induces systemic defense responses in plants. The third case of study reports on the possibility of manipulating the JA-signalling pathway by modifying the endogenous ligand JA-Ile. Based on the crystal structure of the JA-Ile receptor, two JA-Ile derived macrolactones were prepared. Both synthetic lactones induce nicotine accumulation to a similar extent as MeJA does in Nicotiana attenuata leaves. Finally, the JA-Ile inactivation mechanism upon ω-hydroxylation is investigated by using a chemical approach. It was found that impaired activity of 12-OH-JA-Ile is likely due to steric hindrance caused by the ω–OH. Furthermore, a convenient synthesis of 12-modified jasmonates is described. The methods discussed in this Dissertation should complement established molecular biology techniques to study plant physiology. New knowledge of the molecular mechanism of JA-Ile signalling ─ from early events like Ca2+-induced JA-Ile burst, until late events like the switch-off of the jasmonate signal ─ is presented.",gnd:4526402-8 gnd:4069806-3 gnd:4318717-1

"Fundamentals of the growth mechanism, tailored properties and applications of 3D hollow carbon foams","['The discovery of 1D carbon nanostructures in the 20th century and subsequently of 2D carbon nanostructures in the past century, a competition for possible applications of this material with outstanding physical properties began. Due to the geometric restriction of 1D and 2D carbon structures, a variety of manufacturing techniques have been developed around of the millennium to synthesise 3D carbon structures, which are also referred to as carbon aerogels or carbon foams. Based on their morphology, these structures offer decisive advantages over the existing structures and thus potentially new fields of application arise in the field of energy storage systems and catalysts. The growth mechanism of carbon structures has a property-defining influence on their properties. During their growth, carbon atoms arrange in ideal hexagonal lattices, which can also lead to defects that adversely affect the properties. These defects can be reduced by annealing processes such as a high-temperature treatment. Besides to defects, it was also shown that the number of carbon layers significantly affect the properties. This work concerned with the analysis of the growth mechanism of the 3D carbon structure Aerographite. This carbon foam has a tetrapodal morphology and is distinguished by its high mechanical and electrical properties at a density down to ~2 mg/cm3. Here, the influence of the growth mechanism via ex-situ studies and the tailoring of the properties such as electrical conductivity is investigated. The wall thickness of the tetrapods can be specifically varied by means of a targeted process control during the synthesis of Aerographite in the CVD process. A stepwise increase in the electrical conductivity occurs because of a subsequent temperature treatment of Aerographite, as a function of the temperature and its VI holding time. Additionally, the healing of Aerographite by a thermal treatment and the influence of the graphitisation on the properties of Aerographite is in focus in this work. Furthermore, this study aims a variation of the morphology and the manufacturing process for 3D carbon foams and the identification of possible applications. The focus here is on an application-related morphology and a comparatively simplified manufacturing process of the carbon structure. The developed carbon foam has a hierarchical globular morphology and is produced based on a porous ceramic template. Based on thermodynamic calculations, a wide range of catalytically active materials can be added to the green body, which are remains after the CVD process. Finally, a carbon foam with incorporated catalysts can be used for several applications.', 'Durch die Entdeckung von Kohlenstoffnanostrukturen (1D, 2D Strukturen) im vergangenen Jahrhundert begann in den darauffolgenden Jahren ein Wettlauf zur Verwendung dieses neuen Werkstofftyps mit herausragenden physikalischen Eigenschaften. Aufgrund der geometrischen Beschränkung von 1D und 2D Kohlenstoffstrukturen wurden um die Jahrtausendwende verschiedenste erstellungstechniken entwickelt, um 3D Kohlenstoffstrukturen zu synthetisieren, welche auch als Kohlenstoffschäume bezeichnet werden. Diese bieten auf Basis deren Morphologie gegenüber den bisherigen Strukturen entscheidende Vorteile, womit sich potentiell neue Anwendungsgebiete im Bereich der Energiespeichersysteme und Katalysatoren ergeben. Dabei beeinflussen insbesondere die Wachstumsmechanismen der Kohlenstoffstrukturen die späteren Eigenschaften. Im Zuge dessen entstehen in der Ausbildung der Kohlenstoffanordnung im hexagonalen Gitter immer wieder Defekte, welche die elektrischen und mechanischen Eigenschaften der Struktur verringern. Diese Defekte können durch Ausheilungsprozesse wie eine Hochtemperaturbehandlung verringert werden. Neben Defekten, wurde auch gezeigt, dass die Anzahl der Kohlenstofflagen die Eigenschaften maßgeblich beeinflussen.

Dieser Kohlenstoffschaum weist eine tetrapodischen Morphologie auf und zeichnet sich durch dessen hohe mechanische und elektrische Eigenschaften bei einer geringen Dichte von bis ~ 2 mg/cm³ aus.

High-fluence ion beam irradiation of semiconductor nanowires,"Doping of nanostructures, in particular semiconductor nanowires, during their synthesis is remarkably difficult due the strict control of process conditions required. Ion beam irradiation is a viable alternative as dopant incorporation it is not inherently limited by chemical potentials. However, in nanowires the sputter yield obtained during ion irradiation is large, because of the large surface to volume ratio. The nanowire diameter and ion energy dependency of the sputter yield can be qualitatively understood by the Sigmund model for sputtering. Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations using the binary collision approximation in the regime where the extent of the ion’s collision cascade in the target material is of similar order of magnitude as the nanowire diameter are confirmed by sputter yields of Si nanowires irradiated at 300 °C with 100 keV and 300 keV Ar, determined by high resolution SEM. The large sputter yield in nanowires causes a non-linear increase in the doping concentration with the irradiated ion fluence, because target material is removed simultaneously to the adding of dopants. Doping concentrations obtained by nano-XRF confirm the non-linear ion fluence dependency in ZnO nanowires irradiated with Mn. This dynamic situation cannot be reproduced with static MC simulations when the sputtered volume is equal to approximately 20 % of the material affected by the ion beam. During the ion irradiation of Si nanowires at room-temperature, heretofore unexpected plastic deformation of the Si is observed. The quantification of the deformation in high resolution SEM images and an irradiation experiment under inverted geometry clearly exclude that the deformation is driven by the momentum transferred by the impinging ion onto target atoms. The deformation rate is also not comparable to that observed in literature under the name “ion-hammering”, so that an alternative, surface tension driven model is suggested.",gnd:4022993-2 gnd:4162347-2 gnd:4707308-1
Space-Time Foliation in Quantum Gravity,"In this thesis, the author considers quantum gravity to investigate the mysterious origin of our universe and its mechanisms. He and his collaborators have greatly improved the analyticity of two models: causal dynamical triangulations (CDT) and n-DBI gravity, with the space-time foliation which is one common factor shared by these two separate models.   In the first part, the analytic method of coupling matters to CDT in 2-dimensional toy models is proposed to uncover the underlying mechanisms of the universe and to remove ambiguities remaining in CDT. As a result, the wave function of the 2-dimensional universe where matters are coupled is derived. The behavior of the wave function reveals that the Hausdorff dimension can be changed when the matter is non-unitary.   In the second part, the n-DBI gravity model is considered.

In order to achieve the precise measurement of the neutrino oscillation, an accurate understanding of the neutrino beam and the neutrino interaction is essential. Thus, the author measured the neutrino beam properties and the neutrino interaction cross sections using a near neutrino detector called INGRID and promoted a better understanding of them. Then, the author performed a neutrino oscillation analysis using the neutrino beam and neutrino interaction models verified by the INGRID measurements. As a result, some values of the neutrino CP phase are disfavored at the 90% confidence level. If the measurement precision is further improved, we may be able to discover the finite CP phase which involves the CP violation. Thus, this result is an important step towards the discovery of CP violation in the lepton sector, which may be the key to understanding the origin of the matter–antimatter asymmetry in the universe.""]",gnd:4171620-6
Atmospheric modeling of airborne GHG observations over Europe using a regional transport model : towards quantitative inversions using multiple species,"Long-term observations of greenhouse gases are necessary to improve our understanding of sources and sinks of GHGs and their interaction with a changing climate. Such observations are used in combination with inverse atmospheric transport models to estimate surface-atmosphere exchange fluxes. Most of these observations are nowadays collected by ground-based networks of tall towers or satellites in low orbit. However, in the last decade, a new stream of data is gaining momentum: regularly collected airborne data. Airborne data provide an interesting alternative because by collecting observations along the vertical path of an aircraft it is possible to better understand the vertical structure of the atmosphere. Originally limited by the cost of rental aircrafts, this new source of data can now provide in-situ measurements on a regular basis thanks to strategic partnerships between academia and airlines all over the world. A clever way to reduce costs is in-fact to exploit platforms that are naturally bound to fly as much as possible like commercial airliners. In Europe, the leading project making use of this technique is MOZAIC/IAGOS (Measurements of Ozone by Airbus In-service airCraft / In-service Aircraft for a Global Observing System). The modeling framework used in this thesis combines a regional Lagrangian transport model (STILT, the Stochastic Time Inverted Lagrangian Transport model) with simulated fluxes from anthropogenic emissions for three trace gases (CO2, CO and CH4), biogenic emissions for CO2, and lateral boundary conditions from global models. We chose this framework because it ensures a fairly good representation of trace gas distribution, it allows for inverse modeling to retrieve regional fluxes, and is flexible enough to assess sources of mismatch between simulated and observed trace gas distributions.",gnd:4121851-6 gnd:4332269-4 gnd:4164521-2 gnd:4169678-5 gnd:4148259-1 gnd:4075677-4 gnd:4438735-0 gnd:4293230-0 gnd:4031648-8
The cone of moving curves on algebraic varieties,"We give a new description of the closed cone of moving curves of a smooth Fano three- or fourfold by finitely many linear equations. In particular, the cone is polyhedral. The proof in the threefold case relies on a famous result of Bucksom, Demailly, Paun and Peternell which says that the cone of moving curves is dual to the cone of pseudoeffective divisors. Additionally, the proof in the fourfold case uses a result of Kawamata which describes the exceptional locus and the flip of a small contraction on a smooth fourfold. This proof provides an inductive way to compute the cone of moving curves and gives a description of the Mori cone of the variety obtained by the the flip of a small contraction.",gnd:4163534-6 gnd:4033824-1 gnd:4581715-7
Die Zufallshaftung im Bürgerlichen Recht : eine dogmatische Abgrenzung zur Haftung für zufällig eintretende Schäden,"['Why should a person be liable for circumstances that are beyond his control? The work by Alexander Seitz focuses on this question. Starting from an introduction to the concept of chance and the dogmatic foundations of the principle of fault, he analyses the provisions of this form of liability in the German Civil Code. This analysis reveals the diversity of this form of liability. The author examines the dogmatic differences between the liability for Acts of God and the liability for random damages in the context of the principles of causality and fault. Furthermore, the author assesses the effectiveness of the establishment of a liability for Acts of God as an instrument of the legislator to control behaviour.', 'Warum soll ein Schuldner für die Folgen von Ereignissen oder Umständen haften, die er – jedenfalls auf den ersten Blick – nicht steuern kann?

Untersuchung von P-Glykoprotein-hemmenden Phospholipiden als bioverfügbarkeitssteigernde Hilfsstoffe,"Zusammenfassung: The efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is responsible for a diminished intestinal absorption of various drug substances, which can impair their oral bioavailability. As a result, higher doses are necessary. This in turn raises therapy costs and increases the risk of intestinal side effects due to higher amounts of incompletely absorbed substance. Hence, suitable P-gp inhibitors as oral bioavailability enhancers are of great interest.Phospholipids exist ubiquitously in nature. They are the most important part of biomembranes, play an essential role in lipid metabolism and are involved in many other physiological processes. Moreover, due to their amphiphilic properties and the ability to form stable vesicles (liposomes) in an aqueous environment, phospholipids are useful pharmaceutical excipients. One application field is the enhancement of solubility and permeability in order to increase the oral bioavailability of drugs. In previous work extraordinary P-gp inhibiting properties were found for the medium-chain phospholipids 8:0 PC and 10:0 PC as well as for the long-chain derivative 22:6 PC",gnd:4062550-3 gnd:4174398-2 gnd:4773018-3 gnd:4017701-4 gnd:4321152-5 gnd:4128790-3 gnd:4167790-0 gnd:4140438-5 gnd:4131432-3
Controls of foreland-deformation patterns in the orogen-foreland shortening system,"The Andean Plateau (Altiplano-Puna Plateau) of the southern Central Andes is the second-highest orogenic plateau on our planet after Tibet. The Andean Plateau and its foreland exhibit a pronounced segmentation from north to south regarding the style and magnitude of deformation. In the Altiplano (northern segment), more than 300 km of tectonic shortening has been recorded, which started during the Eocene. A well-developed thin-skinned thrust wedge located at the eastern flank of the plateau (Subandes) indicates a simple-shear shortening mode. In contrast, the Puna (southern segment) records approximately half of the shortening of the Altiplano - and the shortening started later. The tectonic style in the Puna foreland switches to a thick-skinned mode, which is related to pure-shear shortening. In this study, carried out in the framework of the StRATEGy project, high-resolution 2D thermomechanical models were developed to systematically investigate controls of deformation patterns in the orogen-foreland pair.

3d virtual histology of neuronal tissue by propagation-based x-ray phase-contrast tomography,"Deciphering the three-dimensional (3d) cytoarchitecture of neuronal tissue is an important step towards understanding the connection between tissue function and structure and determining relevant changes in neurodegenerative diseases. The gold standard in pathology is histology, in which the tissue is examined under a light microscope after serial sectioning and subsequent staining. It is an invasive and labor-intensive technique which is prone to artifacts due to the slicing procedure. While it provides excellent results on the 2d slices, the 3d anatomy can only be determined after aligning the individual sections, leading to a non-isotropic resolution within the tissue. X-ray computed tomography (CT) offers a promising alternative due to its potential resolution and large penetration depth which allows for non-invasive imaging of the sample's 3d density distribution. In classical CT, contrast formation is based on absorption of the x-rays as they pass through the sample. However, weakly absorbing samples like soft tissue from the central nervous system give nearly no contrast. By exploiting the much stronger phase shifts for contrast formation, which the sample induces in a (partially) coherent wavefront, it can be substantially increased. During free-space propagation behind the sample, these phase shifts are converted to a measurable intensity image by interference of the disturbed wave fronts. In this thesis, 3d virtual histology is performed by means of propagation-based x-ray phase-contrast tomography on tissue from the central nervous system of humans and mice. A combination of synchrotron-based and laboratory setups is used to visualize the 3d density distribution on varying lengths scales from the whole organ down to single cells. By comparing and optimizing different preparation techniques and phase-retrieval approaches, even sub-cellular resolution can be reached in mm-sized tissue blocks. The development of an automatic cell segmentation workflow provides access to the 3d cellular distribution within the tissue, enabling the quantification of the cellular arrangement and allowing for extensive statistical analysis based on several thousands to millions of cells. This paves the way for biomedical studies aimed at changes in cellular distribution, e.g., in the course of neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or ischemic stroke.",gnd:4169148-9 gnd:4113240-3 gnd:4025092-1 gnd:4038639-9 gnd:4171594-9 gnd:4321722-9 gnd:4019752-9 gnd:4756133-6 gnd:4041649-5
Secular Evolution of Self-Gravitating Systems Over Cosmic Age,"['Introduction -- Secular Diﬀusion -- Razor-thin Discs -- Razor-thin Discs and Swing Ampliﬁcation -- Thickened Discs -- Quasi-Keplerian Systems -- Conclusion.', 'Tackling galactic evolution in a truly novel way, this outstanding thesis statistically explores the long-term evolution of galaxies, using recent theoretical breakthroughs that explicitly account for their self-gravity. While treating processes statistically, the astrophysical differences on each scale are also captured. As the archetype of self-amplified diffusion, the implications of the thesis go far beyond astrophysics. Gravity is the driving force in galaxies, from their far outskirts to their innermost cores. These “extended kinetic theories” offer unique physical insights into the competing dynamical processes at play, complementing N-body approaches. The thesis successfully gauges the role of nature and nurture in establishing the galaxies’ observed properties, using kinetic equations to capture both sources of fluctuations. Further, it shows how secular diffusion shapes the phase space structure of cold stellar disks. The thesis subsequently determines the characteristic timescales and examines the signatures of secular evolution in this framework on two scales: from the kinetic evolution in galactic disks and their thickening via giant molecular clouds; all the way down to the stellar resonant relaxation of the central cluster and its black hole.']",gnd:4130671-5 gnd:4021908-2 gnd:4174972-8 gnd:4012277-3 gnd:4352109-5 gnd:4057364-3

Boosting for generic 2D/3D object recognition,"Generic object recognition is an important function of the human visual system. For an artificial vision system to be able to emulate the human perception abilities, it should also be able to perform generic object recognition. In this thesis, we address the generic object recognition problem and present different approaches and models which tackle different aspects of this difficult problem. First, we present a model for generic 2D object recognition from complex 2D images. The model exploits only appearance-based information, in the form of a combination of texture and color cues, for binary classification of 2D object classes. Learning is accomplished in a weakly supervised manner using Boosting. However, we live in a 3D world and the ability to recognize 3D objects is very important for any vision system. Therefore, we present a model for generic recognition of 3D objects from range images. Our model makes use of a combination of simple local shape descriptors extracted from range images for recognizing 3D object categories, as shape is an important information provided by range images. Moreover, we present a novel dataset for generic object recognition that provides 2D and range images about different object classes using a Time-of-Flight (ToF) camera.",gnd:4314334-9 gnd:4839853-6 gnd:4431718-9
"Molekulare Charakterisierung von Staphylococcus aureus, ESBL-/AmpC-bildenden Escherichia coli und Salmonella enterica aus legal und illegal aus Drittländern eingeführten Lebensmitteln","['Meat and meat products are imported into the EU in large quantities. In addition to legal imports, considerable amounts of these products are introduced illegally, for example in passenger luggage. This might facilitate the global spread of zoonotic pathogens and antimicrobial resistances through contaminated meat. However, to date, few studies provide information about the characteristics of individual isolates entering Germany and the EU in these ways. The available data on strains isolated from illegally imported meat is particularly scarce. For this reason, the present study focused on a detailed characterization of zoonotic pathogens recovered from legally and illegally imported meat and meat products. Isolates of three different clinically relevant bacterial species, which can cause foodborne infections or intoxications as well as systemic infections, were included in the analyses. These comprised methicillin-resistant (MRSA, n = 9) and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA, n = 14), AmpC- or extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli (n = 16), and Salmonella enterica (n = 5). The genetic relationship of the isolates within each species was determined using different molecular typing procedures. All isolates were further examined regarding their antimicrobial resistance phenotype and genotype. For this purpose, several methods were used, including antimicrobial susceptibility testing, PCR assays, whole genome sequencing, sequence analyses of individual genes and conjugation experiments. S. aureus- and E. coli-isolates were additionally tested for the presence of major virulence-associated genes. Various antimicrobial resistances were identified among the 23 S. aureus isolates, including nine MRSA recovered from illegally imported meat products, and 14 isolates were resistant to substances from three or more classes of antimicrobials. Additionally, unusual resistance patterns were observed. Several isolates lacking an MRSA genotype showed borderline resistance to oxacillin. Another isolate carried an unusual variant of the phenicol-resistance gene fexA, which conferred resistance to chloramphenicol but not to florfenicol.Molecular typing results revealed a marked genetic heterogeneity among the S. aureus isolates. No isolate belonged to CC398, the predominant livestock-associated clonal complex in Western Europe. Instead, many isolates belonged to clonal lineages frequently found in humans (sak-, chp-, scn-positive isolates of CC1, CC5, CC80). Moreover, major virulence-associated determinants were identified among the isolates. These comprised genes encoding enterotoxins, including sea and sed, as well as genes coding for other important virulence factors such as the Panton-Valentin leucocidin, toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (tst1) and exfoliative toxin D (etD). Furthermore, a total of 36 ESBL-/AmpC-producing E. coli were examined, including three isolates from illegally imported meat products. The identification of their respective β-lactamase genes revealed that blaCTX-M-2 was the most prevalent ESBL gene among the isolates, followed by the AmpC β-lactamase gene blaCMY-2 and blaCTX-M-8. In contrast to this, ESBL producers isolated from livestock or meat in the EU most frequently carry blaCTX-M-1, blaTEM-52 or blaSHV-12. In addition to β-lactam-resistance, a variety of phenotypic and genotypic resistances against other classes of antimicrobial agents was determined among the isolates. Most common were resistances to tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim and gentamicin. In addition, many isolates displayed a decreased susceptibility to fluoroquinolones and nine of the 36 isolates carried plasmid-mediated quinolone-resistance determinants (qnrB or qnrS). Different typing methods revealed a considerable genetic heterogeneity among the isolates. A total of 25 different multilocus sequence types were determined and all four major phylogenetic groups (A, B1, B2, D) were identified. Phylogenetic group D was particularly prevalent. This group, together with group B2, comprises most extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli. In addition, various virulence- and fitness-associated genes were identified, such as hlyE, iroN and astA. Most prevalent were genes frequently associated with isolates recovered from poultry (iss, tsh). One isolate carried genes that are characteristic for enteropathogenic E. coli, including eae, espB_O26 and genes encoding a type III secretion system. Of the five Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica isolates, two isolates from illegally imported meat, were identified as S. Infantis and S. Weltevreden. Whereas the S. Infantis isolate was resistant against substances from five classes of antimicrobials, the S. Weltevreden did not display any antimicrobial resistances. The three isolates recovered from legal imports belonged to the serovar Heidelberg or were non-flagellated. All three isolates from legal imports were resistant to third generation cephalosporins and carried the AmpC β-lactamase gene blaCMY-2. They were additionally resistant to ciprofloxacin, tetracycline and sulfamethoxazole. This is worrying as co-resistance against third generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones are currently rarely observed among non-typhoidal salmonellae in the EU. The blaCMY-2 genes of the isolates were located on conjugative plasmids that could be transferred into an E. coli recipient strain. In two cases, a co-transfer of sul2 and tet(A), mediating resistance against sulfonamides and tetracycline, respectively, was observed. Overall the results of this study revealed that legally as well as illegally imported meat and meat products can harbor S. aureus, E. coli and Salmonella enterica isolates with multiple antimicrobial resistances and major virulence determinants. Many isolates differed genetically from isolates typically found on meat products in the EU and novel gene variants were identified in this study. In addition, several isolates showed unusual resistance phenotypes. As a result, infections or a colonization of persons with these resistant bacteria could occur. Furthermore, resistance determinants that are currently uncommon in the EU could be transferred to other bacteria via horizontal gene transfer. Consequently, international trade and the illegal transportation of meat and meat products could facilitate the spread of zoonotic pathogens and antimicrobial resistances over long distances.', 'Jährlich werden in großem Umfang Fleisch und Fleischprodukte aus Drittländern in die EU eingeführt. Neben dem legalen Import werden auch nicht unerhebliche Mengen dieser Produkte illegal eingeführt, beispielsweise im Reisegepäck. Über kontaminiertes Fleisch könnte somit auch die globale Verbreitung von Zoonoseerregern und antimikrobiellen Resistenzen gefördert werden. Jedoch wurden bisher nur in wenigen Studien gezielt einzelne Isolate untersucht, die auf diesen Wegen nach Deutschland bzw. in die EU gelangen. Besonders über Isolate, die sich auf illegal eingeführten Produkten befinden, gibt es bisher kaum Informationen. Daher erfolgte im Rahmen dieser Arbeit eine eingehende Charakterisierung von Zoonoseerregern, die aus legal und illegal importierten Fleischwaren gewonnen wurden, mit dem Ziel zu überprüfen, ob solche Produkte ein mögliches Reservoir für resistente und/oder besonders virulente Stämme der untersuchten Bakterienspezies darstellen. Dabei wurden Isolate von drei klinisch relevanten Bakterienspezies untersucht, die eine wichtige Rolle als Erreger von Lebensmittelinfektionen bzw. –intoxikationen spielen und zudem systemische Erkrankungen hervorrufen können. Dies umfasste Methicillin-resistente (MRSA, n = 9) sowie Methicillin-sensible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA, n = 14), AmpC- oder extended-spectrum β-Laktamase (ESBL)-produzierende Escherichia coli (n = 36) sowie Salmonella enterica (n = 5). Es erfolgte eine molekulare Typisierung der jeweiligen Isolate sowie eine eingehende Charakterisierung hinsichtlich ihres Resistenzphänotyps und ‑genotyps. Für S. aureus und E. coli-Isolate erfolgte zusätzlich ein spezifischer Nachweis Virulenz-assoziierter Gene. Dabei kamen für die jeweilige Spezies geeignete Methoden zum Einsatz. Diese umfassten antimikrobielle Empfindlichkeitstestungen, verschiedene Typisierungsverfahren, Mikroarray-Analysen, PCR-Assays, Ganzgenomsequenzierung, Sequenzanalysen einzelner Gene und Konjugations-Experimente. Unter den 23 untersuchten S. aureus-Isolaten, darunter neun MRSA aus illegal eingeführten Fleischprodukten, wurden diverse Resistenzen nachgewiesen und 14 Isolate waren resistent gegenüber Wirkstoffen aus drei oder mehr Wirkstoffklassen. Zudem wurden teilweise ungewöhnliche Resistenzmuster beobachtet. So wiesen einige der S. aureus-Isolate, die keinen MRSA-Genotyp aufwiesen, eine verminderte Empfindlichkeit gegenüber Oxacillin auf. Bei einem weiteren S. aureus-Isolat wurde zudem eine ungewöhnliche Variante des Phenicol-Resistenzgens fexA identifiziert, welche lediglich eine Resistenz gegenüber Chloramphenicol vermittelt, jedoch nicht gegenüber Florfenicol. Die molekulare Typisierung zeigte eine deutliche genetische Heterogenität unter den Isolaten. Kein Isolat gehörte zu dem in der EU typischen Nutztier-assoziierten klonalen Komplex CC398. Stattdessen konnten viele der Isolate anhand der Ergebnisse der Erreger-Typisierung klonalen Linien zugeordnet werden, die häufig beim Menschen vorgefunden werden (sak-, chp-, scn-positive Isolate des CC1, CC5, CC80). Des Weiteren wurden teils bedeutende Virulenzdeterminanten nachgewiesen, darunter diverse Gene, die für Enterotoxine codieren, einschließlich sea und sed, sowie Gene für verschiedene weitere bedeutende Virulenzfaktoren wie das Panton-Valentin-Leukozidin, das Toxic Shock Syndrome Toxin-1 (tst1) und das exfoliative Toxin D (etD). Es wurden zudem insgesamt 36 ESBL-/AmpC-bildende E. coli untersucht, darunter drei aus illegal importierten Fleischwaren. Die Bestimmung der β-Laktamasegene der 36 ESBL-/AmpC-bildenden E. coli zeigte, dass blaCTX-M-2 das häufigste ESBL-Gen unter den Isolaten war, gefolgt vom AmpC-β-Laktamasegen blaCMY-2 und blaCTX-M-8. Im Gegensatz dazu tragen ESBL-Bildner von Nutztieren und von Fleischprodukten in der EU überwiegend blaCTX-M-1, blaTEM-52 oder blaSHV-12. Neben der Resistenz gegenüber β-Laktamen konnten diverse phänotypische und genotypische Resistenzen gegenüber weiteren Wirkstoffklassen nachgewiesen werden. Besonders häufig waren Resistenzen gegenüber Tetrazyklin, Sulfamethoxazol/Trimethoprim und Gentamicin. Eine beträchtliche Anzahl der E. coli-Isolate zeigte zudem eine verminderte Fluorchinolon-Empfindlichkeit und neun der Isolate trugen Plasmid-vermittelte Chinolon-Resistenzdeterminanten (qnrB oder qnrS). Auch bei den E. coli-Isolaten konnte mittels verschiedener Typisierungsverfahren eine deutliche genetische Heterogenität nachgewiesen werden. So konnten insgesamt 25 unterschiedliche Multilokus-Sequenztypen ermittelt werden sowie alle vier phylogenetischen Hauptgruppen (A. B1, B2, D) nachgewiesen werden, wobei die Isolate besonders oft zur Gruppe D gehörten. Diese umfasst zusammen mit Gruppe B2 den Großteil aller extra-intestinal pathogenen E. coli. Es konnten zudem verschiedene Virulenz- und Fitness-assoziierte Gene nachgewiesen werden, darunter hlyE, iroN und astA. Häufig wurden Gene nachgewiesen, welche oft bei Geflügel-assoziierten Isolaten vorkommen (iss, tsh). Ein Isolat trug zudem Gene, die typisch für enteropathogene E. coli sind, darunter eae, espB_O26 und Gene für ein Typ-III-Sekretionssystem. Von den insgesamt fünf Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica-Isolaten wurden zwei Isolate aus illegal importiertem Fleisch als S. Infantis und S. Weltevreden identifiziert. Während das S. Infantis-Isolat Resistenzen gegenüber Wirkstoffen aus fünf Wirkstoffklassen aufwies, zeigte das S. Weltevreden-Isolat keinerlei phänotypische Resistenzen. Die drei Isolate aus legalen Importen gehörten zum Serovar Heidelberg oder waren unbegeißelt. Alle drei Isolate aus legalen Importen zeigten Resistenzen gegenüber Cephalosporinen der dritten Generation und trugen das AmpC-β-Laktamasegen blaCMY-2. Sie waren zudem resistent gegenüber Ciprofloxacin, Tetrazyklin sowie Sulfamethoxazol. Dies ist bedenklich, da Co-Resistenzen gegenüber Cephalosporinen der dritten Generation und Fluorchinolonen bei nicht-typhoiden Salmonellen in der EU derzeit selten sind. Die blaCMY-2-Gene der Isolate lagen jeweils auf konjugativen Plasmiden, die sich auf einen E. coli-Empfängerstamm übertragen ließen. In zwei Fällen erfolgte ein Co-Transfer der Gene sul2 und tet(A), welche für Sulfonamid- bzw. Tetrazyklinresistenz codieren. Insgesamt konnte im Rahmen dieser Arbeit aufgedeckt werden, dass legal sowie illegal importierte Fleischwaren S. aureus, E. coli- und Salmonella enterica-Isolate beherbergen können, die mitunter multiple antimikrobielle Resistenzen und bedeutsame Virulenzdeterminanten aufweisen. Viele Isolate unterschieden sich genetisch deutlich von jenen, die in der EU üblicherweise auf Fleischprodukten nachgewiesen werden und es wurden bisher unbeschriebene Genvarianten identifiziert. Zudem wiesen die Isolate mitunter ungewöhnliche Resistenzphänotypen auf. In der Folge könnte es zu einer Infektion oder Besiedlung von Personen durch solche resistenten Stämme kommen. Des Weiteren besteht die Möglichkeit einer Übertragung von derzeit in der EU wenig verbreiteten Resistenzdeterminanten auf andere Bakterienstämme durch horizontalen Gentransfer. Der internationale Handel und die illegale Einfuhr von Fleisch und Fleischprodukten könnten somit die Ausbreitung von Zoonoseerregern und antimikrobiellen Resistenzen über weite Strecken fördern.']",gnd:4044890-3 gnd:4299972-8 gnd:4204817-5 gnd:4002257-2 gnd:4143180-7
Heterogeneous effects of weather and climate change on human migration,"While estimated numbers of past and future climate migrants are alarming, the growing empirical evidence suggests that the association between adverse climate-related events and migration is not universally positive.

Effect of biochar amended soils on infiltration processes,"['Klappentext: Climate change imposes new challenges on agricultural practices due to extreme and rapid changes in the environmental conditions. Soil conservation becomes a primarily task due to its importance for supporting agricultural sustainability and food security. This thesis deals with the analysis and simulation of the effect of biochar amendments on soil water dynamics. In a microscale, infiltration at the topsoil is analyzed; in a macroscale, its impact in catchment hydrology is assessed. An analysis of the main soil parameters affected by the biochar amendments is presented. The role of the biochar chemical characteristics on the soil amendments and the effect of the biochar dosage as a function of the soil type are exposed. The impact of biochar of two different soil materials is analyzed in terms of the effect of the main soil physical and hydraulic properties. Simulation of intense and repetitive extreme climate conditions (by means of wetting and drying periods) are considered as a critical environmental parameter influencing the dynamics of soil aggregate formation in the topsoil. The effect of biochar amendments on the soil water balance equation considers the infiltration process as a key factor on the surface runoff formation. The water infiltration response by the amendments is tested by conventional infiltration equations and a statistical regression model in order to determine the main parameters and mechanisms that deals with the transport of water at the surface and in the soil matrix. Several scenarios of the complexity of the addition of biochar, as a soil conservation management option, at a macroscale level are evaluated. In this case, all the soil water balance parameters are included and the discharge outputs reveal that biochar as a source of organic carbon alters soil aggregation and pore characteristics enhancing or reducing the capacity of the soil matrix to conduct water; and these bulk changes are a function of intense periods of wetting and drying. It is shown that application of biochar as amendment as an option for soil conservation and water management has a complex relation of the biomass composition, application dosage, soil type and environmental conditions.', 'Klappentext deutsch: Der Klimawandel stellt die landwirtschaftlichen Praktiken vor neue Herausforderungen, da sich die Umweltbedingungen extrem und schnell ändern.

Advancing charge selective contacts for efficient monolithic Perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells,"Hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites are one of the most promising material classes for photovoltaic energy conversion. In solar cells, the perovskite absorber is sandwiched between n- and p-type contact layers which selectively transport electrons and holes to the cell’s cathode and anode, respectively. This thesis aims to advance contact layers in perovskite solar cells and unravel the impact of interface and contact properties on the device performance. Further, the contact materials are applied in monolithic perovskite-silicon heterojunction (SHJ) tandem solar cells, which can overcome the single junction efficiency limits and attract increasing attention. Therefore, all contact layers must be highly transparent to foster light harvesting in the tandem solar cell design. Besides, the SHJ device restricts processing temperatures for the selective contacts to below 200°C. A comparative study of various electron selective contact materials, all processed below 180°C, in n-i-p type perovskite solar cells highlights that selective contacts and their interfaces to the absorber govern the overall device performance. ...",gnd:4142569-8 gnd:4077445-4 gnd:4173836-6 gnd:4674119-7 gnd:4150451-3 gnd:4203832-7 gnd:4758772-6 gnd:116732739X

Simulating the impact of herbicide drift exposure on non-target terrestrial plant communities,"In Europe, almost half of the terrestrial landscape is used for agriculture. Thus, semi-natural habitats such as field margins are substantial for maintaining diversity in intensively managed farmlands. However, plants located at field margins are threatened by agricultural practices such as the application of pesticides within the fields. Pesticides are chemicals developed to control for undesired species within agricultural fields to enhance yields. The use of pesticides implies, however, effects on non-target organisms within and outside of the agricultural fields. Non-target organisms are organisms not intended to be sprayed or controlled for. For example, plants occurring in field margins are not intended to be sprayed, however, can be impaired due to herbicide drift exposure. The authorization of plant protection products such as herbicides requires risk assessments to ensure that the application of the product has no unacceptable effects on the environment. For non-target terrestrial plants (NTTPs), the risk assessment is based ...",gnd:4045587-7 gnd:4061619-8

Unsupervised pattern discovery in automotive time series : pattern-based construction of representative driving cycles,"In the last decade unsupervised pattern discovery in time series, i.e. the problem of finding recurrent similar subsequences in long multivariate time series without the need of querying subsequences, has earned more and more attention in research and industry. Pattern discovery was already successfully applied to various areas like seismology, medicine, robotics or music. Until now an application to automotive time series has not been investigated. This dissertation fills this desideratum by studying the special characteristics of vehicle sensor logs and proposing an appropriate approach for pattern discovery. To prove the benefit of pattern discovery methods in automotive applications, the algorithm is applied to construct representative driving cycles.

Investigating local surface displacements associated with anthropogenic activities by satellite radar interferometry : application to Staufen im Breisgau and Ketzin,"Direct anthropogenic influences on the Earth’s subsurface during drilling, extraction or injection activities, can affect land stability by causing subsidence, uplifts or lateral displacements. They can occur in localized as well as in uninhabited and inhabited regions. Thus the associated risks for humans, infrastructure, and environment must be minimized. To achieve this, appropriate surveillance methods must be found that can be used for simultaneous monitoring during such activities. Multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar interferometry (MT-InSAR) methods like the Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) and the Small BAseline Subsets (SBAS) have been developed as standard approaches for satellite-based surface displacement monitoring. With increasing spatial resolution and availability of SAR sensors in recent years, MT-InSAR can be valuable for the detection and mapping of even the smallest man-made displacements.

"Impact of hillslope thermokarst on the nearshore carbon budget along the Yukon Coast, Canada","In ice-rich permafrost regions, changes in the permafrost thermal regime cause surface disturbances. These changes are amplified by the increase in air temperatures recorded in the Arctic in the past decades. Thermokarst is a process that leads to surface subsidence and formation of characteristic landforms following thawing of ice-rich permafrost or melting of massive ice. Thermokarst is widespread on hillslopes and the number of associated landforms is increasing in the Arctic. Through this process large amounts of material are eroded and transported to the sea or accumulate along hillslopes. While hillslope thermokarst modifies terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, there is limited understanding of its environmental impact at a regional scale. In this thesis we quantify the environmental impacts of hillslope thermokarst on the valley and nearshore ecosystems along the Yukon Coast, Canada.

Architectural modelling and verification of open service-oriented systems of systems,"Systems of Systems (SoS) have received a lot of attention recently. In this thesis we will focus on SoS that are built atop the techniques of Service-Oriented Architectures and thus combine the benefits and challenges of both paradigms. For this thesis we will understand SoS as ensembles of single autonomous systems that are integrated to a larger system, the SoS. The interesting fact about these systems is that the previously isolated systems are still maintained, improved and developed on their own. Structural dynamics is an issue in SoS, as at every point in time systems can join and leave the ensemble. This and the fact that the cooperation among the constituent systems is not necessarily observable means that we will consider these systems as open systems. Of course, the system has a clear boundary at each point in time, but this can only be identified by halting the complete SoS. However, halting a system of that size is practically impossible. Often SoS are combinations of software systems and physical systems. Hence a failure …",gnd:4841015-9
Untersuchungen über die Wirkungen von Zeolithzulagen auf die Pansenfermentation des Rindes in vitro,"['Feeding today’s dairy cows has to provide for a stable fermentation in the rumen to allow for the desired productivity. Different feed supplements are used to compensate for imbalances or deficiencies of the ration. Studies demonstrate an impact of zeolite supplementation on rumen metabolism. Zeolites – clinoptilolites, for example – are negatively charged tectosilicates with pores and channels specific of each framework type. As a consequence, they can selectively bind cations from the surrounding medium and ion-exchange existing channel cations for them. Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine the effect of Klinofeed®, a clinoptilolite of sedimentary origin, on the fermentation in the fluid phase of the rumen which appears to be the first possible point of action. An artificial rumen (all-glass, bulk incubation type, closed system) corresponding to the one used by CZERKAWSKI and BRECKENRIDGE (1969) was used. Fermentation processes in the rumen liquid were analyzed during six hours of incubation. The following parameters were measured at three different sampling times (0 h, 3 h, 6 h of incubation): redox potential, pH value, concentrations of glucose and volatile fatty acids (acetic, propionic, n-butyric, n-valeric, hexanoic, i-butyric, i-valeric acid and their sum), production of fermentation gases, concentrations of methane, ammonia, microbial protein and nucleobases (cytosine, uracil, thymine, guanine, adenine and their sum), protozoal motility, numbers of protozoa (in total and differentiated according to their size). For the incubation intervals 0–3 h, 3–6 h and 0–6 h the magnitude of the changes, the production or the consumption of the parameters were calculated. Two distinct trials with different zeolite dosages were conducted. The first trial consisted of 45 days when 0,34 g Klinofeed® were applied in accordance with the producer’s recommended daily amount per animal. In the course of the second trial (eleven days) the double dose of the clinoptilolite (0,68 g) was added. The supplementation of Klinofeed® moderately changed the fermentation pattern and stabilized the environment (pH value lower in the control fermenters) in both trials. The glucose added as substrate for the microorganisms was almost completely metabolized during the first three hours of incubation under control conditions as well as in the zeolite fermenters without any evidence of an increase in the bacterial matter in the zeolite fermenters (as indicated by the lacking increased production of microbial protein or nucleobases). Hence, it is justified to assume that the increased production of volatile fatty acids (trial 1: +7,8 % n-butyric acid; trial 2: +19,3 % acetic, +8,6 % propionic and +9,9 % n-butyric acid, sum of all measured volatile fatty acids +8,8 %; in each case for the complete incubation and relative to control) and methane [trial 1 (0–6 h): +14,4 %; trial 2 (0–3 h): +12,5 %] was the result of relative shifts in the rumen microbiome and/or of the metabolic pathways that took place. No further methods were available to substantiate the assumption of a microbiome shift. Neither was the mechanism by which Klinofeed® could influence the microbiome revealed. This gap in knowledge should be closed in future studies.', 'Die bedarfsgerechte Fütterung heutiger Milchkühe muss eine stabile Pansenfermentation erzeugen, denn nur so können die Kühe die gewünschten Leistungen erbringen. Um dies sicherzustellen, werden verschiedene Futtermittel-zusatzstoffe eingesetzt, die Unausgewogenheiten oder Mängel der Ration aus-gleichen. Studien zeigen, dass Zeolithe, zum Beispiel Klinoptilolithe, die infolge ihres Aufbaus (negativ geladene Kristallgitter mit für jeden Gittertyp spezifischen Kanälen und Hohlräumen) selektiv Kationen aus dem umgebenden Milieu aufnehmen und vorhandene Kanalkationen durch diese ersetzen können, den Pansenstoffwechsel von Rindern beeinflussen. Aus diesem Grund wurde in der vorliegenden Arbeit die Wirkung von Klinofeed®, einem Klinoptilolith sedimentären Ursprungs, auf die Fermentation im flüssigen Panseninhalt des Rindes, als erstem möglichem Wirkungsort, unter In-vitro-Bedingungen untersucht. Mit dem verwendeten Kurzzeitsystem nach CZERKAWSKI und BRECKENRIDGE (1969), einem künstlichen Pansen vom geschlossenen Blocktyp, konnten die Fermentationsvorgänge in der flüssigen Phase des Panseninhalts während sechsstündiger Inkubation beurteilt werden. Dazu wurden folgende Parameter an drei Probennahmezeitpunkten (0 h, 3 h, 6 h Inkubationsdauer) erfasst: Redoxpotential, pH-Wert, Glucosekonzentration, Konzentrationen der flüchtigen Fettsäuren (Essig-, Propion-, n-Butter-, n-Valerian-, Hexan-, i-Butter- und i-Valeriansäure sowie deren Summe), Gasproduktion, Methankonzentration, Ammoniakkonzentration, bakterieller Proteingehalt, Konzentrationen der Nukleobasen (Cytosin, Uracil, Thymin, Guanin, Adenin sowie deren Summe), Protozoenmotilität und Anzahl der Protozoen in Summe sowie differenziert nach Größe. Aus den Messwerten wurde die Größe der Veränderung bzw. die Produktion oder der Verbrauch der Parameter während der Inkubationsintervalle 0–3 h, 3–6 h und 0–6 h errechnet. Zwei Versuche mit unterschiedlicher Klinofeed®-Dosis wurden durchgeführt. Im ersten Versuch wurde an 45 Versuchstagen die der Fütterungsempfehlung entsprechende Menge von 0,34 g Klinofeed® pro Fermenter zugelegt. Im zweiten Versuch (elf Versuchstage) wurde die Dosis auf 0,68 g verdoppelt. Durch die Zulage von Klinofeed® wurde das Fermentationsmuster in beiden Versuchen moderat verändert und das Milieu stabilisiert (pH-Wert in den Kontrollfermentern niedriger als in den mit Klinofeed® versetzten Zulagefermentern). Die als Substrat eingesetzte Glucose wurde sowohl in den Kontroll- als auch in den Zulagefermentern bereits innerhalb der ersten drei Inkubationsstunden beinahe vollständig verstoffwechselt, ohne dass in den Zulagefermentern eine Vermehrung der Bakterienmasse (bakterielle Protein- bzw. Nukleobasenproduktionen) gegenüber den Kontrollen belegt werden konnte. Deshalb ist anzunehmen, dass die Steigerungen der Produktion flüchtiger Fettsäuren (Versuch 1: +7,8 % n-Buttersäure; Versuch 2: +19,3 % Essig-, +8,6 % Propion- und +9,9 % n-Buttersäure, in Summe aller flüchtigen Fettsäuren +8,8 %; jeweils über die Gesamtinkubation und in Relation zur Kontrolle) und der Methanproduktion [Versuch 1 (0–6 h): +14,4 %; Versuch 2 (0–3 h): +12,5 %] durch relative Verschiebungen innerhalb des Pansenmikrobioms und/oder der benutzten Stoffwechselwege hervorgerufen wurden. Mit den Methoden, die für die eigenen Versuche zur Verfügung standen, war es nicht möglich, den Erklärungsansatz einer Mikrobiomveränderung weiter zu erhärten.

Algorithms and experiments for parameterized approaches to hard graph problems,"Many combinatorial problems that come up in the real world have been classified as NP-hard [Garey and Johnson 1979]. An example is the following task: After a series of experiments, certain pairs of experiments are found to have conflicting results. We therefore know that for each pair, at least one of the experiments was faulty. We now want to find the minimum number of experiments to discard such that there are no more conflicts. This problem, in its abstract form as a graph problem, is known as Vertex Cover, where given a graph, we search for a minimum number of vertices to delete to get rid of all edges. It is by now an established assumption that NP-hardness implies an inherent combinatorial explosion in the solution space that leads to running times growing exponentially with the input size. This means that large instances of NP-hard problems cannot always be solved efficiently to optimality.",gnd:4818897-9 gnd:4164921-7 gnd:4121121-2
"Die geregelte logische Uhr, eine globale Uhr für die tracebasierte Überwachung paralleler Anwendungen","Event tracing and monitoring of the program flow and the message exchanges of parallel applications are difficult if each processor has its own unsynchronized clock. A survey of several strategies to generate a global time is given, and the limits are discussed. The controlled logical clock is presented. It is a new method based on Lamport's logical clock and provides a method to modify inexact timestamps of tracefiles. The new timestamps guarantee the clock condition, i.e. that the receive event of a message has a later timestamp than the send event. With the control algorithm an approximation of the maximum of all local processor clocks is used as global time. The corrected timestamps can also be used for performance measurements with pairs of events in different processes. A piecewise linear backward amortisation of the clock corrections guarantees a minimal error for measurements of time intervals between events in the same process. No additional protocol overhead is needed for the new method while tracing the application. The method can be implemented as a filter for tracefiles or it can be integrated into monitor and debug tools for parallel applications.",gnd:4209015-5 gnd:4130847-5 gnd:4030102-3 gnd:4238872-7
Quantification of total microbial biomass and metabolic activity in subsurface sediments,"Metabolically active microbial communities are present in a wide range of subsurface environments. Techniques like enumeration of microbial cells, activity measurements with radiotracer assays and the analysis of porewater constituents are currently being used to explore the subsurface biosphere, alongside with molecular biological analyses. However, many of these techniques reach their detection limits due to low microbial activity and abundance. Direct measurements of microbial turnover not just face issues of insufficient sensitivity, they only provide information about a single specific process but in sediments many different process can occur simultaneously. Therefore, the development of a new technique to measure total microbial activity would be a major improvement. A new tritium-based hydrogenase-enzyme assay appeared to be a promising tool to quantify total living biomass, even in low activity subsurface environments. In this PhD project total microbial biomass and microbial activity was quantified in different subsurface sediments using established techniques (cell enumeration and pore water geochemistry) as well as a new tritium-based hydrogenase enzyme assay. By using a large database of our own cell enumeration data from equatorial Pacific and north Pacific sediments and published data it was shown that the global geographic distribution of subseafloor sedimentary microbes varies between sites by 5 to 6 orders of magnitude and correlates with the sedimentation rate and distance from land. Based on these correlations, global subseafloor biomass was estimated to be 4.1 petagram-C and ~0.6 % of Earth's total living biomass, which is significantly lower than previous estimates. Despite the massive reduction in biomass the subseafloor biosphere is still an important player in global biogeochemical cycles. To understand the relationship between microbial activity, abundance and organic matter flux into the sediment an expedition to the equatorial Pacific upwelling area and the north Pacific Gyre was carried out. Oxygen respiration rates in subseafloor sediments from the north Pacific Gyre, which are deposited at sedimentation rates of 1 mm per 1000 years, showed that microbial communities could survive for millions of years without fresh supply of organic carbon. Contrary to the north Pacific Gyre oxygen was completely depleted within the upper few millimeters to centimeters in sediments of the equatorial upwelling region due to a higher supply of organic matter and higher metabolic activity. So occurrence and variability of electron acceptors over depth and sites make the subsurface a complex environment for the quantification of total microbial activity. Recent studies showed that electron acceptor processes, which were previously thought to thermodynamically exclude each other can occur simultaneously. So in many cases a simple measure of the total microbial activity would be a better and more robust solution than assays for several specific processes, for example sulfate reduction rates or methanogenesis. Enzyme or molecular assays provide a more general approach as they target key metabolic compounds. Since hydrogenase enzymes are ubiquitous in microbes, the recently developed tritium-based hydrogenase radiotracer assay is applied to quantify hydrogenase enzyme activity as a parameter of total living cell activity. Hydrogenase enzyme activity was measured in sediments from different locations (Lake Van, Barents Sea, Equatorial Pacific and Gulf of Mexico). In sediment samples that contained nitrate, we found the lowest cell specific enzyme activity around 10^(-5) nmol H_(2) cell^(-1) d^(-1). With decreasing energy yield of the electron acceptor used, cell-specific hydrogenase activity increased and maximum values of up to 1 nmol H_(2) cell^(-1) d^(-1) were found in samples with methane concentrations of >10 ppm. Although hydrogenase activity cannot be converted directly into a turnover rate of a specific process, cell-specific activity factors can be used to identify specific metabolism and to quantify the metabolically active microbial population. In another study on sediments from the Nankai Trough microbial abundance and hydrogenase activity data show that both the habitat and the activity of subseafloor sedimentary microbial communities have been impacted by seismic activities. An increase in hydrogenase activity near the fault zone revealed that the microbial community was supplied with hydrogen as an energy source and that the microbes were specialized to hydrogen metabolism",gnd:4156734-1 gnd:4186243-0 gnd:4132389-0 gnd:4140407-5 gnd:4354995-0 gnd:4160910-4
Charge multiplication detectors for use in the HL-LHC and measurement of the production cross-section in pp collisions of a W boson in association with a charm quark at sqrt (s) = 8 TeV with the ATLAS detector,"Zusammenfassung: The exploration into the subatomic world has lead to particle accelerators of every increasing size. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC), currently the world’s largest particle accelerator and machine, was built with the primary goal of dis- covering the Higgs boson, the last ingredient of the Standard Model, and to search for new physics beyond the Standard Model’s predictions. The discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012 at the LHC by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations has been a triumph for human ingenuity. Although its discovery is an important milestone in understanding the fundamental workings of nature, the search for a full uni- fied theory describing all natural phenomena is far from over. Physicists know the Standard Model is not the end game, as it fails to account for various ob- served phenomena, which include dark matter, dark energy, and perhaps most embarrassingly, gravity. The search for new physics requires precise knowledge of several parameters in the Standard Model. This includes the distribution of quarks and gluons inside the proton, usually in terms of parton distribution functions, or PDFs. T",gnd:1093621397 gnd:4375595-1

Electrical characterization of organic devices : case study: polythiophene-fullerene based solar cells,"['Polymer based solar cells were fabricated by using Poly(3-hexylthiophene-2.5diyl)(P3HT) as a donor, combined with the fullerene derivative [6,6]-phenyl -C61 butyric acid methyl ester, (PCBM) as an acceptor, in a bulk heterojunction structure. Electrical and optical properties of these organic devices were studied together with the dependence of current-voltage characteristics on temperature and illumination intensity. The  increase of the short circuit current density with temperature is evidence of a thermally activated transport mechanism, characteristic to disordered materials. This result explains the specific feature  of organic solar cells to operate better in a warm climate, rather than at low temperatures, a totally different behaviour compared to conventional inorganic solar cells.   The origin of open circuit voltage was investigated by varying the work function of the metallic electrode. From this experiment it was concluded that the open circuit voltage is very sensitive to the workfunction of metallic electrode. The hypothesis of Fermi level pinning of the workfunction of the metallic electrode to the LUMO level of the acceptor  could not be confirmed in the case of P3HT:PCBM based solar cells. The thermal annealing applied to P3HT:PCBM based solar cells, was found to be a very effective method to increase the short current density, and therefore, the overall power conversion efficiency of the device. Morphology investigations (by using the Atomic Force Microscopy) for  P3HT:PCBM based solar cells show the presence of large PCBM clusters (>500nm) built as a result of thermal annealing. Based on AFM results, as well as on current density-voltage (J-V) curves and external quantum efficiency measurements, the amount of the PCBM acceptor was optimized in the blend to a P3HT:PCBM weight ratio between 1:0.9 and 1:1. The best P3HT:PCBM based solar cell was fabricated with a P3HT:PCBM weight ratio of 1:1 and gave the following results: Jsc= 6.4mA/cm2, Voc= 0.59V, FF = 63.2%, h = 2.4% at room temperature and a white light intensity of 100mW/cm2. Finally, it was shown that the electrical performance of P3HT:PCBM based solar cells can be considerably influenced by the quality of the organic material used for the fabrication. <engl.>', 'Es wurden Polymer-Solarzellen mit einer Bulk-Heteroverbindungsstruktur hergestellt, wobei P3HT als Donor und das Fullerenderivat PCBM als Akzeptor fungiert. Die elektrischen und optischen Eigenschaften dieser organischen Zellen wurden hauptsächlich über die Abhängigkeit ihrer Strom-Spannungs-Charakteristiken von Temperatur und Lichtintensität studiert. Die Zunahme der Kurzschlußstromdichte mit der Temperatur ist Beweis für einen thermisch aktivierten Transportmechanismus, der für ungeordnete Materialien charakteristisch ist. Dieses Ergebnis erklärt die hervorstechende Eigenschaft organischer Solarzellen in einem warmen Klima besser zu funktionieren, als bei tiefen Temperaturen. Konventionelle anorganische Solarzellen zeigen im Gegensatz dazu ein ganz anderes abweichendes Verhalten. Der Ursprung der Leerlaufspannung wurde durch Variation der Austrittsarbeit der Metallelektrode untersucht. Aus diesem Experiment konnte geschlossen werden, daß die Leerlaufspannung empfindlich von der Austrittsarbeit der verwendeten Metallelektrode abhängt. Die Hypothese des Fermi- Level- Pinnings der Austrittsarbeit der Metallelektrode an das Lumoniveau des Akzeptors hat sich im Falle der P3HT:PCBM Solarzellen nicht bestätigt. Die thermische Behandlung der P3HT:PCBM Solarzellen erwies sich als eine sehr effektive Methode zur Erhöhung der Kurzschlußstromdichte und damit auch als sehr wirkungsvoll zur Verbesserung des Gesamtwirkungsgrades der Zelle. Untersuchungen der Morphologie der P3HT : PCBM Solarzellen mittels AFM zeigen die Präsenz sehr großer PCBM Cluster (> 500 nm) als ein Resultat der thermischen Behandlung.

A Statistical and Multi-wavelength Study of Star Formation in Galaxies,"['This thesis presents a pioneering method for gleaning the maximum information from the deepest images of the far-infrared universe obtained with the Herschel satellite, reaching galaxies fainter by an order of magnitude than in previous studies. Using these high-quality measurements, the author first demonstrates that the vast majority of galaxy star formation did not take place in merger-driven starbursts over 90% of the history of the universe, which suggests that galaxy growth is instead dominated by a steady infall of matter. The author further demonstrates that massive galaxies suffer a gradual decline in their star formation activity, providing an alternative path for galaxies to stop star formation. One of the key unsolved questions in astrophysics is how galaxies acquired their mass in the course of cosmic time. In the standard theory, the merging of galaxies plays a major role in forming new stars. Then, old galaxies abruptly stop forming stars through an unknown process. Investigating this theory requires an unbiased measure of the star formation intensity of galaxies, which has been unavailable due to the dust obscuration of stellar light.', 'Introduction -- Summary of the Work Done in This Thesis -- Modelling the Integrated IR Photometry of Star-forming Galaxies -- Gencat: An Empirical Simulation of the Observable Universe -- The Downfall of Massive Star-Forming Galaxies During the Last 10 Gyr -- Reaching the Distant Universe with ALMA -- Conclusions and Perspectives.']",gnd:1135746702 gnd:4057364-3 gnd:4139325-9 gnd:4148259-1

Design and evaluation of computer arithemetic based on carry-save and signed-digit redundant number representations,"The continuing demand for technological advances while dealing with mutual constraining characteristics of digital systems as for instance lower feature size, lower power consumption, and lower compute latency drives a need for constant innovation. To further improve state-of-the-art digital hardware, thorough knowledge of computer arithmetic is needed. This thesis explores selected aspects of the design and evaluation of computer arithmetic based on carry-save and signed-digit redundant number representations to reduce the area, the critical path latency, and the power consumption of arithmetic circuits. Carry-save arithmetic is frequently used to realize basic arithmetic operations requiring inner product calculations, as multiplication, multiply-add, multiply-accumulate, and digital filters. This thesis enhances multiplication and multiply-accumulation based on carry-save arithmetic by improving the well known Wallace and Dadda partial product reduction strategies. An alternative concept of time-based reduction strategies is introduced as well and applied to multiply-accumulate units resulting in reduced area, critical path latency, and power consumption. A competitive redundant number representation is the signed-digit number representation. Not frequently implemented in state-of-the-art hardware designs, it is recurring in prototype development. Implemented signed-digit arithmetic is based on signed-binary adder cells. This thesis demonstrates the need for optimizing these cells and presents concepts of a systematic design space exploration of signed-binary adder cells. Additionally, the error resilience capabilities of signed-digit arithmetic is evaluated and favorable digit encoding schemes are presented.",gnd:4117700-9 gnd:4135485-0

"Stochastic Models for Fault Tolerance : Restart, Rejuvenation and Checkpointing","""As modern society relies on the fault-free operation of complex computing systems, system fault-tolerance has become an indispensable requirement. Therefore, we need mechanisms that guarantee correct service in cases where system components fail, be they software or hardware elements. Redundancy patterns are commonly used, for either redundancy in space or redundancy in time. Wolter's book details methods of redundancy in time that need to be issued at the right moment. In particular, she addresses the so-called """"timeout selection problem"""", i.e., the question of choosing the right time for different fault-tolerance mechanisms like restart, rejuvenation and checkpointing. Restart indicates the pure system restart, rejuvenation denotes the restart of the operating environment of a task, and checkpointing includes saving the system state periodically and reinitializing the system at the most recent checkpoint upon failure of the system. Her presentation includes a brief introduction to the methods, their detailed stochastic description, and also aspects of their efficient implementation in real-world systems. The book is targeted at researchers and graduate students in system dependability, stochastic modeling and software reliability. Readers will find here an up-to-date overview of the key theoretical results, making this the only comprehensive text on stochastic models for restart-related problems.""",gnd:4197459-1 gnd:4584423-9 gnd:4154497-3 gnd:4057633-4 gnd:4542599-1 gnd:4123192-2
Transiting Sub-stellar companions on intermediate-mass stars,"The aim of the project is to evaluate the predictions from theories of planet formation by determining the absolute frequency of close-in planets of intermediate-mass stars (IMSs). The detection of close-in planets of IMSs can put constraints to the theories of planet formation. First, it is known from infrared observations that the lifetimes of protoplanetary discs of IMSs are half as long as those of solar-mass stars. Second, radial velocity surveys of evolved IMSs show that the frequency of planets at distances larger than 5 AU is higher in comparison to solar-mass stars. However, not much is known about the frequency of close-in planets. An important key to constrain processes of planet formation and evolution is, thus, answering the question: “Is  the  frequency  higher  for  close-in  planets  of  IMSs  than for solar-mass stars?” The transit method is best suited to find such planets. First, it is not affected by the fast rotation of these stars and secondly, it favours the detection of close-in planets. I used the CoRoT database to survey all IMSs observed with this instrument. In contrast to ground- based surveys, the precision of CoRoT allows the detection of all Jupiter-sized transiting objects orbiting IMSs. I first determined the mass-distribution of the stars in the sample. Second I found 14 transit candidates of IMSs in the CoRoT survey and observed them spectroscopically to determine their masses. In result, I detected one planet as well as two very young brown dwarfs with large radii of IMSs by this survey. Among them, the first transiting brown dwarf of a B-type star. The frequency for close-in planets of IMSs derived from this survey is 0.11 ± 0.04 %. This means that close-in sub-stellar companions of IMSs are rare. In the context of disc-migration, this surprising result can be explained by the lifetime of the protostellar discs of IMSs. It is apparently long enough for the planets to form, but on average too short for them to migrate inwards.",gnd:4291270-2 gnd:4180348-6 gnd:4174796-3 gnd:4320078-3 gnd:4456110-6
Approaching N = 1 Super-Yang-Mills theory with improved lattice actions,"Investigations of the non-perturbative effects of N=1 Super-Yang-Mills theory on the lattice are demanding. The lattice breaks translation invariance to a discrete subgroup and consequently also supersymmetry. With a fine-tuning of the Wilson fermions to a critical point, it can be achieved that supersymmetry (as well as chiral symmetry) are restored in the continuum limit. This thesis is intended to contribute to weaken the associated restrictions. Unbroken supersymmetry in the continuum arranges the bound states in supermultiplets. When susy is broken, for example by the lattice discretization, then the mass-degeneracy ends. Based on this observation, we tried to modify the fermionic lattice action to minimize the mass difference of states within a supermultiplet and thus the supersymmetry breaking. The first extension of the Wilson Dirac operator was a clover term. It is known from the Symanzik improvement program that a proper choice of the coefficient reduces the lattice discretization artifacts to the order O(a²) in the lattice spacing. There are several possibilities to determine this coefficient and we compared them with a heuristic parameter scan. As an alternative, we added a twisted mass term to the Wilson Dirac operator. When the difference of the untwisted mass parameter to its critical value corresponds to the value of the parity-breaking mass, then the two mesonic partners a-η and a-f approach at finite lattice spacing the same mass. After we observed this improvement of the supermultiplet in the numerical data, we also found an analytical proof. Additionally we investigated the eigenvalues of the free Dirac operator with twists in the mass term and the Wilson term. There we found an O(a) improvement when those two terms are orthogonal to each other. With the 45°-mass-twisted Wilson Dirac operator, we performed simulations on a 16^3x32 lattice and analyzed all states of the Veneziano-Yankielowicz and Farrar-Gabadadze-Schwetz supermultiplets.",gnd:4190409-6 gnd:4157374-2 gnd:4169025-4 gnd:4128574-8

However, it is not trivial to determine the effect which a new method has on a process, and in addition if the new method pays-off for a company’s specific context. Evaluations of new methods without considering the context are often not satisfying. Also expensive pilot studies rather lead to a specific picture about the influence of a new method than to a more generic statement of its impact.

The close environment of AFGL 490 in radio-interferometric observations,"The formation of high-mass stars in a scaled-up version of the low-mass star formation scenario has gained confidence in recent years, but open questions remain regarding details like the structure of circumstellar disks and interaction between accretion and outflows. Advances in spatial resolution and sensitivity of (sub)millimeter instruments as ALMA open the possibility to study high-mass star formation in detail, which is challengig due to large distances, embedding in gas and dust during the whole formation phase and complex environments. This work focuses on AFGL490, an isolated nearby object at the border between intermediate and high-mass (8-10 solar masses), and one of the few known more massive objects with spatially resolved observations of a circumstellar disk. Interferometric millimeter observations of C34S, CS and CH3OH were analyzed and show two distinct emission regions in the close environment of AFGL490: an innermost region containing the earlier detected circumstellar disk, and a wider region tracing the densest parts of the outflow wall, while the region between both appears to be devoid of (emitting) dense gas. Modelled emission from flared and partially shadowed disk models plus a line radiative transfer was compared with the observed emission in the uv-plane in an attempt to better characterize the circumstellar disk properties. Spatial resolution and sensitivity of the analyzed observations do not allow for strong constraints, but provide evidence for a C34S distribution more centrally condensed than that of C17O, a possible hint for a chemical structure of the disk. In the wider environment, inverse P-Cygni line profiles hint at ongoing gas infall from the outer envelope; the strongest emission features could represent a region where the infalling envelope gas strikes the dense outflow walls close to the plane of the innermost disk.

Biomechanical analysis of nursing tasks for physical relief by collaborative robotics,"Musculoskeletal disorders are among the most significant health risks contributing to the global decline in mental health and physical performance. Occupations with high physical work demands, such as patient handling in nursing, are associated with high rates of long-term absenteeism and disability due to musculoskeletal pain and disorders.

On the dynamics of marcus type stochastic differential equations,"In this work metric dynamical systems (MDS) driven by Lévy processes in positive and negative time are constructed.

Further a perfection theorem for càdlàg processes and the conjugacy of solution of Marcus type SDEs driven by Lévy processes and solutions of certain RDEs is proven. This result is applied to verify locally conjugacy of solutions of Marcus type SDEs and solutions of linearised Marcus type SDEs (referring to the results of Hartman–Grobman for deterministic ODEs). Subsequently, stable and unstable manifolds are constructed using the Lyapunov–Perron method. Furthermore, the Lyapunov–Perron method is modified to prove a foliation of the stable manifold.

The uniqueness of phase field modeling is that the crack paths are automatically determined as part of the solution and no interface tracking is required. The damage parameter varies continuously over the domain. But this flexibility comes with associated difficulties: (1) a very fine spatial discretization is required to represent sharp local gradients correctly; (2) fine discretization results in high computational cost; (3) computation of higher-order derivatives for improved convergence rates and (4) curse of dimensionality in conventional numerical integration techniques.

Maximal geodesics in lorentzian geometry,"The present thesis contains the first steps toward an Aubry-Mather theory, in the sense of V. Bangert, D. Burago and J. Mather, for Lorentzian manifolds. The first part studies the class of spacetimes (class A) to be considered in the subsequent Lorentzian Aubry-Mather theory. Besides the necessary properties and objects (stabil timecone, stabil time separation) a topological characterization of class A spacetimes is given analogous to the ""global splitting theorem"" of Geroch and Bernal/Sanchez. The second part then devolopes the Lorentzian Aubry-Mather theory for class A spacetimes. This encompasses the existence of maximal invariant measures and relations of the qualitive behavior of homologically maximizing geodesics to convexity properties of the subgraph of the stabil timecone. Additionally we study calibrations for class A spacetimes and prove the corresponding versions of Mather's graph theorem for maximal invariant measures. In the third part we define a subclass (class A_1) of class A spacetimes and prove the optimal multiplicity results, as expected from the Riemannian case, for maximal invariant measures in class A_1 spacetimes. The optimality is demonstrated with the Lorentzian Hedlund examples.",gnd:4156669-5 gnd:4012248-7
Charge transport layers in organic photovoltaics (OPV) : challenges and opportunities for the large-scale deployment of OPV,"Organic photovoltaics present a great opportunity to decarbonize the worlds energy generation. Due to their versatility in terms of colors, mechanical flexibility, light weight, containing abundant elements and the inherent flexibility of organic chemistry, on which they are based, they could allow for fast deployment of photovoltaics in hitherto not seen scenarios and at massive scales in potentially very short times. They have by now reached efficiencies of 14% on the scale of small modules though they are unfortunately still lacking behind other PV technologies, though a-Si modules, which still have niche applications like semi-transparent glassing actually has lower efficiencies. Beyond efficiency long lifetimes have been presented even for the latest high performing materials extrapolated under illumination of up to 30 years. By now there is also a broad understanding of the fundamental processes in organic solar cells. This applies to how charges are generated, as well as how they degrade. Though the broad strokes are well understood, there are many fine details still to be etched out, which will be important to further develop OPV in a more focused manner. As at present much of their development is still primarily driven by serendipitous exploration of new materials and processing methods. Especially in terms of the active layer materials. But beyond active layer materials also charge transport layers have gained a lot of focus in the resent years, as they can greatly impact stability and performance as well. In this work the agrivoltaics is presented as an interesting niche for upscaling of OPV and it is discussed in how far charge transport layers in such OPV devices are playing an important role in terms of their transparency, their impact on performance and stability. Finally a newly developed method is introduced for they analysis of JV-curves of solar cells for the fast detection of defects.",gnd:7617672-1 gnd:4121476-6
Stochastic satisfiability modulo theories : a symbolic technique for the analysis of probabilistic hybrid systems,"['This thesis considers symbolic techniques for reachability as well as expected-value analysis of probabilistic hybrid discrete-continuous systems, being based on a probabilistic logic called stochastic satisfiability modulo theories (SSMT). Due to the expressive power of this logic, the step-bounded dynamics of probabilistic hybrid systems can be encoded by SSMT formulae. Aiming at an automatic analysis procedure, a substantial part of the thesis is devoted to algorithms for solving SSMT problems and to algorithmic enhancements improving performance. Applicability of the resulting bounded model checking procedures is demonstrated on a realistic case study from the domain of networked automation systems. To overcome the limitation of step-boundedness, the thesis introduces a generalized concept of Craig interpolation and shows its use in probabilistic model checking of finite-state systems. <engl.>', 'Diese Dissertation untersucht symbolische Ansätze zur Erreichbarkeits- und Erwartungswertanalyse probabilistischer hybrid diskret-kontinuierlicher Systeme, die auf einer probabilistischen Logik namens Stochastic Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SSMT) aufbauen.

Phase reaction during thermochemical treatment of sewage sludge and biomass ashes with alkali compounds to increase nutrient plant availability,"Phosphorus is an essential element for plants, animals and humans (e.g., storage and transfer of energy, genetic materials, bones and teeth). In agriculture, fertilization of phosphorus is necessary to replenish the stock in soils. A promising phosphorus source to produce recycling fertilizers is sewage sludge ashes from mono-sludge incineration plants which may have high phosphorus content (12%). A process to recover phosphorus from these ashes is thermochemical treatment in a rotary kiln (AshDec®-process). A large-scale plant located in Altenstadt (Bavaria) is expected to start operating in 2023. This process transforms poorly plant-available phosphorus phases in the sewage sludge to highly plant-available calcium alkali phosphate Ca(Na,K)PO4 in the thermochemical product. To achieve this phase transformation, sewage sludge ash is treated with sodium and / or potassium additives at 800-1000 °C. In this thesis, new thermodynamic data for calcium alkali phosphates were determined and used for thermodynamic calculations. Furthermore, when sodium sulfate was used, the formation of calcium sodium phosphates was complete at above 875 °C. The use of potassium sulfate required a reaction temperature above 1100 °C related to the melting points of these sulfate phases. In order to incorporate potassium sulfate into the process at low temperatures, sodium sulfate and potassium sulfate were mixed before treatment. As a result, the reaction temperatures could be reduced below 1000 °C. A fundamental finding was potassium is preferably incorporated into aluminosilicates instead of phosphates. Thus, phosphorus compounds contain less potassium as expected. This could be a drawback for the production of phosphorus-potassium fertilizers. Furthermore, Magnesium and potassium can be incorporated into the known phase CaNaPO4 and lead to the formation of other phase modifications in the phase system (Ca,Mg)(Na,K)PO4.",gnd:4045855-6 gnd:4130962-5 gnd:4132140-6
Few-cycle microscopy of a laser wakefield accelerator,"This thesis describes the development and first application of a novel diagnostic for a laser driven wakefield accelerator. It is termed Few‐Cycle Microscopy (FCM) and consists of a high-resolution imaging system and probe pulses with a duration of a few optical cycles synchronized to a high intensity laser pulse. Using FCM has opened a pristine view into the laser‐plasma interaction and has allowed to record high‐resolution images of the plasma wave in real time. Important stages during the wave’s evolution such as its formation, its breaking and finally the acceleration of electrons in the associated wake fields were observed in the experiment as well as in simulations, allowing for the first time a quantitative comparison between analytical and numerical models and experimental results. Using this diagnostic, the expansion of the wave’s first period, the so‐called ‘bubble’, was identified to be crucial for the injection of electrons into the wave. Furthermore, the shadowgrams taken with FCM in combination with interferograms and backscatter spectra have revealed a new acceleration regime when using hydrogen as the target gas. It was found that in this scheme electron pulses are generated with a higher charge, lower divergence and better pointing stability than with helium gas. The underlying pre‐heating process could be attributed to stimulated Raman scattering, which has been thought up till now to be negligible for short (t < 30 fs) laser pulses. However, as it is shown in this thesis, the interplay of the temporal intensity contrast of the laser pulse 1 ps before the peak of the pulse together with a sufficiently high plasma electron density can provide suitable conditions for this instability to grow, resulting in improved electron pulse parameters.",gnd:1128828189 gnd:4222149-3 gnd:4286364-8 gnd:4174841-4
Plant organic matter mobilization and export in fluvial systems : a case study from the eastern Nepalese Arun Valley,"The global carbon cycle is closely linked to Earth’s climate. In the context of continuously unchecked anthropogenic CO₂ emissions, the importance of natural CO₂ bond and carbon storage is increasing. An important biogenic mechanism of natural atmospheric CO₂ drawdown is the photosynthetic carbon fixation in plants and the subsequent longterm deposition of plant detritus in sediments. The main objective of this thesis is to identify factors that control mobilization and transport of plant organic matter (pOM) through rivers towards sedimentation basins. I investigated this aspect in the eastern Nepalese Arun Valley. The trans-Himalayan Arun River is characterized by a strong elevation gradient (205 − 8848 m asl) that is accompanied by strong changes in ecology and climate ranging from wet tropical conditions in the Himalayan forelad to high alpine tundra on the Tibetan Plateau.

Prediction-based nature-inspired dynamic optimization,"['Dynamic optimization problems typically appear in real-world systems underlying environmental influence. Solving this kind of problems requires algorithms considering relationships between problem instances at different points in time. Nature-inspired optimization is frequently used to solve dynamic problems as they store information about past environments in the population by a natural means. In order to circumvent the premature convergence of nature-inspired meta-heuristics in dynamic optimization problems, prediction is one among other approaches. In this thesis, we show that neural networks are a reasonable alternative to commonly used prediction models, suggest variants extending particle swarm optimization by prediction, and propose a new strategy to take into account predictive uncertainty during optimization. In addition, we construct a benchmark generator and a convergence measure that are tailored to the characteristics of prediction-based optimization algorithms.', 'Dynamische Optimierungsprobleme treten häufig in Anwendungen auf, die Umwelteinflüssen unterliegen.

Curved boundary crossing of bessel processes,"Zusammenfassung: We study the first exit time of a Bessel process over a curved boundary and find several asymptotic formulas for the corresponding first exit densities.We start with the examination of the first time at which a multi-dimensional Brownian motion hits a hyperplane and determine its density as well as the joint density of the first hitting time and the location of the first hit. From this we deduce an upper bound for the density of the first exit time of a Bessel process over a straight line.Then, we derive higher-dimensional counterparts of two well-known integral equations for the first exit density of a one-dimensional Brownian motion. They build the basis of our arguments in the following chapters.After that, we obtain two asymptotic representations of the first exit density of a Bessel process over a curved boundary for large times. We only study boundaries that are upperclass functions at infinity and that satisfy certain additional conditions.In the last chapter, we first complete the result of the first chapter by giving a lower bound for the first exit density of a Bessel process over a straight line.This is followed by the examination of first exit densities for distant boundaries. We find that under certain conditions the first exit density over a curved boundary is asymptotically equivalent to the density of the first exit time over the accompanying tangent to this boundary. This result is then further refined.We close the chapter with an example for another possible approach to first boundary crossing problems, the method of images. Our findings in this last section are further confirmation of the preceding results",gnd:4274463-5 gnd:4128328-4

Microstructure evolution and stress corrosion cracking behavior in short-term thermomechanically processed Al-Cu-Li alloys,"['Increasing access to space leaves human footprints in orbits closer to the Earth. Today, space debris poses a major risk for in-service missions and on-ground casualties. Reducing the amount of debris is the only way to preserve key orbits. One strategy to avoid future debris is to maneuver spacecraft after mission into the atmosphere where the structure burns up. This strategy is taken into account at early design stages of modern spacecraft. Therefore, material choices must be made to ensure high structural demisability. Titanium, currently used in propellant tanks, is often a large portion, by mass, of the total structure and does not completely ablate during re-entry. Aluminum-copper-lithium alloys are being considered as a substitute for titanium in propellant tanks because they deliver comparable specific material properties at a higher demisability rate. Because the technology of aluminum-copper-lithium alloys in space structures is not as mature as that of titanium, new joining methods must be developed. Friction stir welding features the unique characteristic of joining in the solid state; thus, it is especially attractive for hard-to-weld alloys such as aluminum-copper-lithium. The development of space structures requires a fundamental knowledge of the material behavior, both during processing and during the subsequent exposure to the environment. In recent years, aluminum copper-lithium alloys have rarely been welded by bobbin tool friction stir welding. The underlying microstructure evolution has been described as complex, certain aspects are not fully understood and contradictory results have been reported. Current knowledge on the behavior of welded joints on this specific alloy under stress and exposed to corrosive environments is limited. Therefore, for the possible use in spacecraft structures, a scientific analysis of the stress corrosion behavior of welded joints is necessary. As part of the present work, two modern aluminum-copper lithium alloys were successfully joined by semi-stationary bobbin tool friction stir welding. Identical parameters allowed a detailed comparison of the process response. The welding process imposes a short time, thermomechanical exposure in the base material that leads to severe microstructure modification. Based on the chemical composition of the two alloys, the microstructural evolution is explained, and a precipitation sequence is proposed. Overaged strengthening precipitates and equilibrium phases of several types were identified to form during welding. These modifications led to a reduced mechanical performance of 78 % of the ultimate tensile strength. Stress corrosion analyses were performed on pre-, as- and post-welded samples and were correlated with the modified microstructure. Stress corrosion cracking phenomena were found to result from the short-time, thermomechanical effect induced by the welding process. The mechanism leading to stress corrosion lies in the modified microstructure, where coarse, precipitates accumulate at the grain boundaries. These particles are observed to promote local galvanic reactions, which promote dissolution and the consequent development of a cracking network under stress.', 'Der stetig wachsende Zugang in den Weltraum hinterlässt menschliche Spuren in erdnahen Umlaufbahnen. Weltraumschrott stellt heute ein erhebliches Risiko für aktive Missionen dar. Die Reduzierung des Weltraumschrotts ist die einzige Möglichkeit den Weltraumzugang nachhaltig zu erhalten. Eine Strategie zur Vermeidung zukünftigen Weltraummülls besteht darin, ausgediente Raumfahrzeuge zum kontrollierten Verglühen in die Atmosphäre zu manövrieren. Diese Strategie wird ab der frühen Entwurfsphase für neue Raumfahrzeuge verfolgt und wird sich auf Materialentscheidungen auswirken. Titan, welches derzeit als Material in Treibstofftanks verwendet wird und einen großen Massenanteil der Gesamtstruktur ausmacht, verglüht beim atmosphärischem Wiedereintritt nur unzureichend. Aluminium-Kupfer-Lithium Legierungen werden als Ersatz für Titan in Treibstofftanks betrachtet, da sie vergleichbare spezifische Materialeigenschaften bei einer niedrigeren Schmelztemperatur bieten. Da Aluminium-Kupfer-Lithium Legierungen in Weltraumanwendungen weniger ausgereift sind als Titan, müssen neue Fügeverfahren eingesetzt werden. Das Reibrührschweißverfahren zeichnet sich durch seine einzigartige Eigenschaft des Fügens im festen Zustand aus. Daher ist es besonders für schwer zu schweißende Legierungen wie Aluminium-Kupfer-Lithium geeignet. Die Entwicklung von Raumstrukturen erfordert ein grundlegendes Wissen über das Materialverhalten, sowohl während der Verarbeitung als auch während des nachfolgenden Einsatzes. In den letzten Jahren wurden Aluminium Kupfer-Lithium Legierungen selten mittels Reibrührschweißen geschweißt. Zudem wurde die zugrundeliegende Entwicklung der Mikrostruktur als komplex beschrieben, sodass bestimmte Aspekte nicht vollständig verstanden und widersprüchlich berichtet wurden. Daher ist das Wissen über geschweißte Konstruktionen unter Belastung und in korrosiver Umgebungen begrenzt. Wenn Aluminium-Kupfer-Lithium Legierungen für den Einsatz in Raumfahrzeugen in Betracht gezogen werden, ist eine grundlegende wissenschaftliche Charakterisierung des Spannungsrisskorrosions verhaltens erforderlich, die sich aus den durch den Schweißprozess hervorgerufenen Mikrostrukturänderungen ergibt. Im Rahmen der vorliegenden Arbeit wurden zwei moderne Aluminium-Kupfer-Lithium Legierungen mittels eines teilstationären Zweischulter-Reibrührwerkzeuges erfolgreich geschweißt. Der Schweißprozess besteht aus einer kurzzeitigen Hochtemperaturphase, welche zu einer starken Veränderung der Mikrostruktur führt. Anhand der chemischen Zusammensetzungseigenschaften der beiden Legierungen wurde die mikrostrukturelle Entwicklung erläutert. So konnte eine Vergröberung der hauptfestigenden Phasen sowie die Bildung von Gleichgewichtsphasen beobachtet werden, welche zu Festigkeitsverlusten der Schweißnaht führten. Zudem wurde eine Spannungsrisskorrosionsanalyse an geschweißten und ungeschweißten Proben durchgeführt und mit der Mikrostrukturtransformation korreliert. Während das Grundmaterial keine kritische Korrosion unter Spannung zeigte, konnte in den Schweißproben eine Beeinträchtigung festgestellt werden. Daher resultieren die Spannungsrisskorrosionserscheinungen aus der kurzzeitigen Hochtemperaturphase, die durch das Reibrührschweißen hervorgerufen wurde. Der zur Spannungsrisskorrosion führende Mechanismus beruht auf Auslagerungen grober Gleichgewichtsphasen an den Korngrenzen. Diese fördern lokale, galvanische Reaktionen, welche zur Auflösung und der anschließenden Entwicklung eines Rissnetzwerks unter Belastung führen.']",gnd:4131028-7

Energy-induced nanoparticle-substrate interactions,"In line with Moore's Law, the disciplines of nanoscience and nanotechnology not only address the demands for miniaturization but also improve the efficacy of working devices. There are numerous synthesis methods to produce and replicate the desired nanostructures. However, certain chemical and physical limitations hinder the fabrication of a wide range of desired nanostructures. A complementary approach to conventional synthesis is to modify the pre-fabricated nanomaterials by introducing energy in a specific environment. This could lead to the development of metastable phases in nanomaterials/nanostructures characterized by unique or even extraordinary structural, electrical, optical, or magnetic properties and functionalities. In this work, ion irradiation is studied as such a method providing a form of external energy modifying the nanoparticle and its adjacent environment. The conventional understanding of ion irradiation is coupled to phenomena such as sputtering, ion beam mixing, and ion channeling in bulk and thin film materials. However, if the issued materials are nanoparticles, the interplay of ion-induced processes and effects requires a significant adjustment of our understanding. Particularly, When the penetration depth of the ion matches the size of the nanoparticle, enhanced sputtering occurs due to the high surface to volume ratio of the nanoparticle. Although sputtering has been studied for a range of nanomaterials, there is a need for more research, particularly on multicomponent materials and different morphologies. When it comes to multicomponent materials, the interaction between sputtering behavior and ion beam mixing presents a unique dynamic that differs from that of single-component material.",gnd:4335201-7 gnd:4333369-2 gnd:4182614-0 gnd:4017547-9
Stochastic differential equations driven by Gaussian processes with dependent increments and related market models with memory,"In the last ten years fractional Brownian motion BHt received a lot of attention (e.g. [Be],[GrNo], [HuOk],[HuOkSa], [So] [DeUs], [Oh] and [DuHuPa]). This process has dependent increments, which make it interesting for many applications such as finance (e.g. [HuOk], [Be]) and network simulations (e.g. [No]). However, BHt has a covariance function E(BHt BHs ),which depends only on the Hurst parameter H 2 (0, 1). It follows for example that one cannot model a process with short range dependency with BHt . As a generalization a class of centered Gaussian processes with dependent increments Bvt is defined. If Bvt is used as noise process, it is often important to have an integral driven by this process.Several authors defined the stochastic integral driven by fractional Brownian motion RR XsdBHs . In order to use this integral to explain stochastic differential equations it is desirably that the stochastic integral driven by fractional Brownian motion has expectation value 0.

Quantum random walks in waveguide lattices,"Random processes are ubiquitous in the natural world as well as in man-made environments. While classical random walks may behave highly complex or even chaotic, there outcome can, in principle, always be predicted from the parameters of the system and the initial conditions. In the realm of quantum mechanics, however, this is not possible as the underlying wave mechanics leads to intrinsically indeterministic outcomes. Moreover, if multiple indistinguishable particles are subjected to such a quantum random walk, their exchange symmetry causes quantum interference, thereby enriching the dynamics of the system even further. In this work, quantum random walks of pairs of indistinguishable photons, the quanta of light, are investigated. Networks of coupled optical waveguides are chosen as the experimental platform of choice, offering a high degree of coherence and versatility. In these photonic lattices, light propagates along one spatial dimension, whereas the individual waveguides are connected by evanescent coupling in the transverse dimensions. In particular, it is investigated how the various degrees of freedom, which are available in such photonic lattices, affect the trajectories in the quantum walks and their complexity. It is shown how the facilitation of both transverse dimensions allows for much richer quantum walks with properties unencountered in planar arrangements. But even if just a single transverse dimension is available, the coupling properties of the lattice along this dimension are a potent degree of freedom, which can be used to manipulate the quantum walk. Finally, an experimental technique is developed which enables a convenient characterisation of the expected quantum walk in an arbitrary waveguide lattice by classical light. The thesis concludes with a summary of the results and an outlook onto further developments in the field.",gnd:4705961-8 gnd:4065317-1
Physically inspired predistortion of RF power amplifiers with artificial neural networks,"Mobile communication is rapidly growing. Increasing demands on capacity and bandwidth have to be addressed by future developments. This means higher signal requirements and bandwidth for transceivers in mobile basestations. Transceivers are the component with highest power consumption in a basestation. Especially analog components show different impairments and nonideal behavior with negative effects on energy efficiency and signal integrity. These effects can be analyzed and mathematically described to build a specific digital signal processing algorithm, which mitigates certain effects. This work treats impairments from machine learning perspective. IQ Imbalance of modulators as well as power amplifier nonlinearities are representive impairments with significant influence on the signal quality. These effects are trained to artificial neural networks (ANNs) for digital impairment mitigation. Furthermore it is shown that the ANNs are able to model different impairment effects with a single network and can be simply enhanced by further input parameters to mitigate dynamic effects. Physically inspired modeling of long term memory effects like thermal memory and charge trapping are a special focus of this work.Der Bedarf an mobiler Kommunikation wächst ständig. Höhere Nachfrage nach Kapazität und Bandbreite müssen durch zukünftige Entwicklungen adressiert werden. Um diese Zielen zu erreichen sind Sende- und Empfangseinheiten für höhere Signalanforderungen und Bandbreiten für Mobilfunkbasisstationen erforderlich. Diese Einheiten verbrauchen die meiste Energie in Basisstationen. Vor allem analoge Komponenten beeinträchtigen die Signalqualität und haben Einfluss auf die Energieeffizienz.

Early events in DNA double strand break repair after damage induction with a laser microbeam,"In the present thesis DNA double strand break (DSB) induction and repair are analysed after laser-microbeam irradiation. Live cell imaging of DNA repair proteins fused to Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) as well as immunofluorescent detection of endogenous protein are used. Laser induced DNA damage, detected by gamma-H2AX foci staining depend on a subtle combination of used laser pulse wavelength, pulse energy and dose. The recruitment times of repair proteins depend inverse linearly on laser pulse energy. By extrapolation to zero, the recruitment time at biological relevant conditions is calculated. Interestingly, considerable spatial dynamics of the foci is found. Two neighbouring foci even can fuse within ~20 min. Recruitment time comparison of molecules representing early and late Non-Homologous end Joining (NHEJ), Homologous Recombination Repair (HRR) and the Mre11-Rad50-NBS1 (MRN) complex reveals that the whole NHEJ machinery is assembled to DSBs within 1 min. Recruitment of latest NHEJ factor (XRCC4) is faster than NBS1 and is not directly influenced by the absence of NBS1. XRCC4 persists at DSBs longer in the G1 cell cycle phase than in G2 where the replacement of NHEJ by HRR molecules occurs. Rad51 is recruited when XRCC4 is released with the complementary kinetics. DNA-PKcs phosphorylation at two sites, known to facilitate DNA end processing, occurs between the recruitment of NHEJ and HRR.",gnd:4150340-5 gnd:4452555-2

Untersuchung des pUL31- und pUL34-unabhängigen Kernaustritts des Pseudorabies Virus,"['The nuclear egress of nucleocapsids is an essential step in the herpesviral replication cycle. Due to its size, the capsid cannot exit the nucleus through the nuclear pores, but instead is transported through the nuclear membrane. The viral proteins pUL34 and pUL31 form the nuclear egress complex (NEC), which recruits cellular and viral kinases to the nuclear membrane. There they phosphorylate lamins, which results in the local dissolution of the nuclear lamina and allows access of the nucleocapsids to the nuclear membrane. Deletion of one or both components of the NEC causes a significant reduction in viral titers but even in absence of the NEC, a few infectious virions are produced, which were used for reversion analysis. Therefore, first the UL34-negative and later also the UL31-negative PrV were passaged on rabbit kidney cells (RK13) until titers in the supernatant were similar to PrV-wildtype. From this supernatant single plaques were picked. These viruses replicated efficiently in the absence of the NEC and were designated as PrV-?UL34Pass and PrV-?UL31Pass, respectively. Ultrastructural analysis showed that the passaged viruses were not transported through the nuclear membrane like PrV-wildtype but through a fragmented nuclear envelope thereby releasing nucleocapsids into the cytosol. The aim of this study was to examine how nuclear egress functions without the NEC.

Kondo physics and thermodynamics of the Anderson impurity model by distributional exact diagonalization,"[""The Distributional Exact Diagonalization (DED) scheme is applied to the description of Kondo physics in Anderson impurity models. Using Friedel's sum rule, we show that the particle constraint ultimately, an essential ingredient of DED, imposes Fermi liquid behavior on the ensemble averaged self-energy and thus is essential for the description of Kondo physics within DED. Using Numerical Renormalization Group (NRG) calculations as a benchmark, we show that DED yields excellent spectra, both inside and outside the Kondo regime for a moderate number of bath sites. However, at finite temperatures the particle constraint has to be relaxed in order to correctly capture the temperature evolution of the spectra. The generalized DED scheme correctly describes the decreasing and ultimately the vanishing of the Kondo peak on increasing the temperature.

Interaction of azobenzene containing surfactants with plasmonic nanoparticles,"The goal of this thesis is related to the question how to introduce and combine simultaneously plasmonic and photoswitching properties to different nano-objects.

It is shown that the constitution of the complexes strongly depends on a surfactant-to-gold molar ratio. At certain molar ratios, particle self-assembly into nanochains and their aggregation have been registered.

The present thesis deals with synchronization in finite ensembles of weakly coupled self-sustained oscillators with distributed frequencies. The standard model for the description of this collective phenomenon is the Kuramoto model – partly due to its analytical tractability in the thermodynamic limit of infinitely many oscillators. Similar to a phase transition in the thermodynamic limit, an order parameter indicates the transition from incoherence to a partially synchronized state. In the latter, a part of the oscillators rotates at a common frequency. In the finite case, fluctuations occur, originating from the quenched noise of the finite natural frequency sample ...",gnd:4063491-7 gnd:1167883853 gnd:4132140-6 gnd:4139923-7 gnd:4132814-0 gnd:4130847-5 gnd:4130671-5

Interacting with personal fabrication devices,"Personal fabrication tools, such as 3D printers, are on the way of enabling a future in which non-technical users will be able to create custom objects. However, while the hardware is there, the current interaction model behind existing design tools is not suitable for non-technical users. Today, 3D printers are operated by fabricating the object in one go, which tends to take overnight due to the slow 3D printing technology. Consequently, the current interaction model requires users to think carefully before printing as every mistake may imply another overnight print. Planning every step ahead, however, is not feasible for non-technical users as they lack the experience to reason about the consequences of their design decisions. In this dissertation, we propose changing the interaction model around personal fabrication tools to better serve this user group. We draw inspiration from personal computing and argue that the evolution of personal fabrication may resemble the evolution of personal computing: Computing started with machines that executed a program in one go before returning the result to the user. By decreasing the interaction unit to single requests, turn-taking systems such as the command line evolved, which provided users with feedback after every input. Finally, with the introduction of direct-manipulation interfaces, users continuously interacted with a program receiving feedback about every action in real-time. In this dissertation, we explore whether these interaction concepts can be applied to personal fabrication as well. ...",gnd:4027266-7 gnd:4125909-9

Design strategy for imaging systems containing freeform surfaces,"Motivations driven by the ever-growing system specifications, alongside the progress in optical manufacturing and metrology open widely the door for implementing freeform surfaces for imaging system performance enhancement. Meanwhile, new challenges regarding handling and analysis are posed for this surface type due to its lack of rotational symmetry. This thesis work focuses on the development of an appropriate aberration analysis tool, as well as implementation strategies of freeform surfaces in imaging systems. The Aldis theorem, which gives the surface contribution for one ray including all orders, is revisited as the foundation for freeform system analysis. With the original theorem’s limitations overcome, this new tool can serve as an alternative for the Seidel diagram, indicating the system sensitivity information for freeform systems. Furthermore, this thesis investigates the numerical approaches utilized for freeform implementation regarding freeform normalization radius, freeform order, optimization strategy, freeform interaction and early-stage manufacturability assessment for both one-freeform and two-freeform issues. As a consequence, the relation between the choice of the freeform location and system aberration constitutions is revealed with the assistance of the surface eccentricity parameter. A successive implementation strategy for freeform orders and freeform quantity is proposed in the form of a workflow.

Interfacially tuned spin transport towards molecular spintronics,"Organic molecules are the carbon-based complex of several atoms, is an innovative and essential element to create nano-structural platforms, as a building block in the field of organic electronics and organic spintronics. Because of its variety and functionality via widely studied synthetic methods, molecules have played an important role in electronics as not only a transport channel in bulk form but also a tuning layer at the interface of hetero structures. The potential of molecular layers has also stood out in spintronics, owing to its mass-low composition producing long spin life time. Organic materials can be employed in spintronics applications, benefiting from their low cost, ease of processing, and chemical tunability. Beyond this advantage, the configuration of molecules on a metal film displays unique phenomena as it can control the molecular spins and interfacial coupling between them, resulting in the emergence of molecular spinterface.

Characterization and optimization of anodes for microbial electrochemical technologies treating wastewater,"Abstract: Microbial electrochemical technologies (METs) can produce power from renewable sources or produce platform chemicals from carbon dioxide. They are developed within a highly multi-disciplinary and dynamic research environment with the aim to contribute to the global energy transition towards sustainable and renewable energy production, energy efficient remediation, and bioproduction processes. This work has carried the development of METs significantly forward on three different levels. <br>(1) Engineering: Existing reactor designs are analyzed in detail and rated. Furthermore, a new reactor concept for the integration of METs into wastewater treatment is presented and characterized. (2) On the biological level, different inoculation strategies for the improvement of anode performance are described and (3) On the methodological level (bio-)electrochemical methods to characterize and evaluate METs are revised.<br>1.The highlight of this work is the development of a new reactor concept (Chapter 5) based on the findings of the analysis and rating of existing reactor designs (Chapter 2.4). The new reactor concept aims at the production of electricity for reducing the overall energy consumption of wastewater treatment and is realized as a combination of METs and membrane bioreactors. It was granted with a German and European patent and the novelty of this development is an anode which is simultaneously used as microfiltration membrane in sidestream crossflow configuration. To evaluate the feasibility of such an anode, the concept is proved using sintered porous stainless steel with G. sulfurreducens and an acetate-based synthetic medium. Resulting current densities were increased up to 4-fold compared to a standard bioelectrochemical anode setup. E.g. a stainless-steel filter of the grade 0.5 µm solely used as anode, achieves current densities of 4 A m−2 in a standard setup and > 15 A m−2 when it is simultaneously used as filtration element in crossflow configuration. To test the feasibility of this new reactor treating wastewater, it is subsequently operated as anaerobic membrane reactor (AnMBR) and the degradation of chemical oxygen demand (COD) monitored. These experiments show, that significant conversion of COD to electrical current on the filter used as anode takes place. The COD removal achieves up to 450 mg L-1 showing great potential for increasing treatment efficiencies and having a polishing effect on the effluent from an AnMBR.<br>2.An ...",gnd:4145597-6 gnd:4142547-9 gnd:4330791-7

Frequenzgesteuertes Öffnen von Stickpacks in zentrifugalen Mikroanalysesystemen,"['Abstract: In this work, a technology has been advanced that enables a long-term stable pre-storage as well as an automated and frequency controlled release of liquids in centrifugal microanalysis systems. For this purpose, liquids were packaged in tubular bags, so-called stickpacks. These stickpacks are produced by an automated form-fill-seal method, which consists of several process steps: a composite film is formed to a tube, longitudinally and transversely heat-sealed, filled with liquid and cross-cutted to produce single stickpacks. Distilled water, ethanol and  3M™ Novec™ 7500 (3M Deutschland GmbH) were used as filling goods and different composite films consisting of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), aluminum and polyethylene (PE) were used as packaging material. The films were sealed at sealing pressures between 9.4 - 28.2 MPa, sealing temperatures between 97 - 119 °C and sealing times between 0.6 - 5.2 s. To examine the opening dynamics of stickpacks, they were inserted and fixed in a chamber of the microanalysis cartridge. By centrifuging the microanalysis cartridge, a hydrostatic pressure is generated inside of the stickpack. At a sufficiently high frequency, the seal is peeled and the liquid is released. To examine and assess the opening dynamics of stickpacks during centrifugation, a camera system with stroboscopic lightning was used.<br><br>Initially, the opening dynamics of stickpacks was investigated for two different load cases. In the first load case, the frequency was accelerated constantly until liquid was released of stickpacks at the so-called burst frequency. It was demonstrated that the burst frequency is related to the acceleration: at an acceleration of 1 Hz/s, 100 stickpacks opened at burst frequencies between 50 to 86 Hz, while at an acceleration of 10 Hz/s the stickpacks opened at burst frequencies between 70 to 101 Hz. This illustrates that the burst frequency is no constant value, but rather depends on the course of the frequency protocol. Consequently, the measured burst frequency is only valid for a specific frequency protocol. A second load case was applied, where a frequency was approached rapidly with an acceleration of 60 Hz/s and held constant for 1000 seconds. The so-called opening delay was measured, which is defined as the duration from the beginning of the frequency protocol until liquid release. At a frequency of 50 Hz, 21 out of 100 stickpacks opened within an opening delay of 36 to 968 seconds, whilst 79 out ...', 'Abstract: In dieser Arbeit wurde eine Technologie weiterentwickelt, die eine langzeitstabile Vorlagerung sowie eine automatisierte und frequenzgesteuerte Freisetzung von Flüssigkeiten in zentrifugalen Mikroanalysesystemen ermöglicht.

Im ersten Belastungsfall wurden Stickpacks mittels einer linearen Frequenzrampe belastet und die sogenannte Berstfrequenz gemessen, also die Frequenz bei der Flüssigkeit aus den Stickpacks austritt. Es hat sich gezeigt, dass die Berstfrequenz von der Änderungsrate der Frequenz abhängt: Bei einem Stichprobenumfang von 100 und einer Änderungsrate von 1 Hz/s öffneten Stickpacks bei Berstfrequenzen von 50 bis 86 Hz, während Stickpacks bei einer Änderungsrate von 10 Hz/s bei Berstfrequenzen von 70 bis 101 Hz öffneten. Dies veranschaulicht, dass die Berstfrequenz eines Stickpacks nicht eine konstante Größe ist, sondern vom Verlauf des Frequenzprotokolls abhängt. Die Berstfrequenz beschreibt die Öffnungsdynamik damit nur vollständig, wenn das spezifische Frequenzprotokoll bekannt ist mit dem die Berstfrequenz ermittelt wurde.

Protein engineering of a Pseudomonas fluorescens esterase : alteration of substrate specificity and stereoselectivity,"['The aim of this thesis was to validate a method called OSCARR for One-pot, Simple Cassette Randomization and Recombination for focused directed evolution, which had been developed by Dr. Hidalgo. It is based upon the megaprimer PCR method using outer primers differing in TM and including asymmetric cycles before the addition of the forward primer to generate more mutated megaprimer. As mutation-carrying primers, spiked oligonucleotides are employed. These spiked oligonucleotides are designed using an algorithm and have strictly defined composition of nucleotides at each position. An OSCARR library of the Pseudomonas fluorescens esterase I (PFE I) of approximately 8000 clones was generated and screened for altered chain-length selectivity. Two mutants with higher activity towards medium chain length p-nitrophenyl esters were identified, both carried the mutation F126I, which causes the substrate entrance tunnel to be widened, thus facilitating access of bulkier substrates to the active site.

Interrogation of passive wireless sensors in harsh environments,"Zusammenfassung: The automotive, aerospace and all other applications working in severe conditions require sensing solutions to monitor critical parameters in order to increase the systems lifetime or to reduce power consumption. The sensors must be small, robust and exhibit low manufacturing costs. Passive wireless sensors have the advantages that they do not require any battery and they can be interrogated with no physical connection to the reader electronics. This thesis reports the development of different torque and high temperature wireless sensing systems based on sensors initially used for radio frequency signal filtering: Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) and microwave dielectric resonators. The described coupling methods between the reader antennas and the sensors improve the sensing accuracy, resolution, interrogation distance and immunity to the environmental clutter, currently being the main issues when using these sensors in harsh environments. Based on the piezoelectric effect and the propagated mechanical wave velocity dependence with the environment, SAW resonators are used for passive wireless torque or temperature sensing on rotating machinery. However, the main source of errors comes from the angular variations of the coupling between the coupler elements and the receiving coupler element impedance. This parasitic frequency shift is known as pulling effect and concerns all measurements using resonators. In this work, several wireless coupling solutions for the interrogation of SAW resonators on a clamp system fixed on a small diameter shaft are presented. The maintained solution is a capacitive coupler based on coplanar strip lines. It allows an angular transmission amplitude variation lower than 4 dB and a single 434 MHz resonator angular frequency pulling lower than 200 Hz (0.46 ppm). The RADAR-based interrogation, Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations, coupler parameters and frequency pulling measurement results are presented to demonstrate the performances of the complete sensing system. Dielectric resonators are resilient in harsh environments where SAW sensors suffer from the packaging and the radiating element constraints. In this work, the sensitivity of multi-mode dielectric resonators over temperature is investigated. The resonance frequency shift is due to the material permittivity change and the thermal expansion. Moreover, dielectric resonators are physically connected to metallic surfaces in order to get a sufficient coupling  ...",gnd:4136749-2 gnd:4789222-5

Direct DNA and RNA detection from blood for the detection of bacterial pathogens,"Abstract: Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) are now increasingly used in clinical microbiology laboratories for the detection of bacterial pathogens from clinical specimens. A major problem with real-time PCR- and RT-PCR-based diagnostic assays of clinical specimens is the low sensitivity and even false-negative results caused by PCR inhibitors, which are ubiquitous in clinical specimens. Consequently, a variety of sample processing methods, PCR facilitators, and specific PCR buffers have been developed for successful DNA and RNA detection from clinical specimens. However, sample processing methods are generally time-consuming, labor-intensive, not suitable for automation, and also have the potential of losing target molecules. Meanwhile, PCR facilitators and specific PCR buffers are generally sample specific, involve the risk of contamination, need further standardization, and may not be equally effective under different laboratory conditions.<br>An alternative to using sample processing methods, PCR facilitators, and specific PCR buffers is the employment of a sturdy DNA polymerase which is resistant to PCR inhibitors for direct DNA and RNA detection from clinical specimens. Thermus thermophilus (Tth) polymerase has proven to be resistant to several common PCR inhibitors present in clinical specimens for DNA detection and also exhibits reverse transcriptase activity in the presence of Mn ions. However, the capacity of Tth polymerase, which acts as both reverse transcriptase and DNA polymerase, for RNA detection in the presence of various clinically relevant PCR inhibitors has not been investigated in detail. In this thesis, 14 PCR inhibitors originating from blood, urine, feces, bodily fluids, muscle tissues, and reagents used during nucleic acid extraction are employed to evaluate the capacity of Tth polymerase for RNA detection. The results show that these PCR inhibitors have different inhibitory effects on the real-time RT-PCR assays by Tth polymerase and the inhibitory effects are concentration dependent. Furthermore, the capacity of Tth polymerase for RNA detection in the presence of various PCR inhibitors is better or at least comparable to its reported capacity for DNA detection in the presence of the same PCR inhibitors. As a result, RNA may be directly analyzed in the presence of some co-purified PCR inhibitors or even directly from certain crude clinical specimens su ...",gnd:4256726-9 gnd:4319830-2

Efficient wave-optical simulations for the modeling of micro-optical elements,"Modern optical fabrication technologies enable the realization of optical components in between  very nanoscopic-  and macroscopic scales without symmetries and with extraordinary accuracies. This opens up novel possibilities in the design of modern optical system. Nevertheless, the ability to take direct advantage out of these developments is intrinsically linked to profound numerical simulation tools to analyze, model and design these systems. Consequently, these demands trigger the steady development and improvement of algorithms, which advances the optical design process and therewith the functionality of related devices. It is one aim of this thesis to introduce and to discuss improved numerical techniques to model micro-optical systems. Moreover, it is a second aim of this thesis to also investigate the potential of these improved simulation methodologies to design micro-optical systems.

Galactic archaeology with metal-poor stars from the Pristine survey,"The Milky Way is a spiral galaxy consisting of a disc of gas, dust and stars embedded in a halo of dark matter. Within this dark matter halo there is also a diffuse population of stars called the stellar halo, that has been accreting stars for billions of years from smaller galaxies that get pulled in and disrupted by the large gravitational potential of the Milky Way. As they are disrupted, these galaxies leave behind long streams of stars that can take billions of years to mix with the rest of the stars in the halo. Furthermore, the amount of heavy elements (metallicity) of the stars in these galaxies reflects the rate of chemical enrichment that occurred in them, since the Universe has been slowly enriched in heavy elements (e.g. iron) through successive generations of stars which produce them in their cores and supernovae explosions. Therefore, stars that contain small amounts of heavy elements (metal-poor stars) either formed at early times before the Universe was significantly enriched, or in isolated environments.

Electronic properties of rhombohedral graphite,"This thesis presents the first systematic electron transport investigation of rhombohedral graphite (RG) films and thus lies at the interface of graphene physics, vdW heterostructure devices and topological matter. Electron transport investigation into the rhombohedral phase of graphite was limited to a few layers of graphene due to the competing hexagonal phase being more abundant. This work reports that in exfoliated natural graphite films, rhombohedral domains of up to 50 layers can be found. In the low energy limit, these domains behave as an N-layer generalisation of graphene. Moreover, being a potential alternative to twisted bilayer graphene systems, RG films show a spontaneous metal-insulator transition, with characteristic symmetry properties that could be described by mean-field theory where superconductivity is also predicted in these low energy bands. A nodal-line semimetal in the bulk limit, RG thin films are a 3D generalisation of the simplest topological insulator model: the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain. Similar to the more usual topological insulators, RG films exhibit parallel conduction of bulk states, which undergo three-dimensional quantum transport that reflects bulk topology.",gnd:4193812-4 gnd:7591667-8 gnd:4322772-7
Coiled coils as mechanical building blocks,"The natural abundance of Coiled Coil (CC) motifs in cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix proteins suggests that CCs play an important role as passive (structural) and active (regulatory) mechanical building blocks.

Self-assembly is driven by hydrophobic and ionic interactions, while the helix propensity of the individual helices contributes additional stability to the structure. As a direct result of this simple sequence-structure relationship, CCs serve as templates for protein design and sequences with a pre-defined thermodynamic stability have been synthesized de novo. Despite this quickly increasing knowledge and the vast number of possible CC applications, the mechanical function of CCs has been largely overlooked and little is known about how different CC design parameters determine the mechanical stability of CCs.

Rural policy implementation in contemporary China : new Socialist countryside,"""This book presents an analysis of adaptive local policy implementation in China in the context of the ""Building of a New Socialist Countryside"" (BNSC) policy framework.

Further, this study illustrates that BNSC is far more than the 'empty slogan' described by many observers when it was launched in 2005/2006. nstead, it has already brought about considerable shifts in terms of the process and outcomes of rural policy implementation.

Assembly and repeat annotation of the nothobranchius furzeri genome,"In aging research, the long lifespan of the current vertebrate model organisms challenges the feasibility of research efforts. The turquoise killifish Nothobranchius furzeri has the shortest lifespan for vertebrates known so far (4-12 months) making it to a valuable new model in aging research. In this thesis, the multi-step process of building genome reference sequence of N. furzeri is described. Based on a broad range of sequencing data and additional map resources, a high-quality genome assembly with a size of 1.24 Gb (N50 57.4 Mb, 19 chromosomes) was achieved. Furthermore, the composition of repetitive sequences in the N. furzeri genome was analyzed. In addition to established repeat detection methods a new software solution (RepARK) was developed and applied. In this analysis, 35.5% of the genome assembly was annotated as repetitive. Using this repeat annotation, it was estimated that the genome assembly contains 90% of the unique sequence while about 60% of the repeats are absent. An analysis in not-assembled data suggests a repeat content in the N. furzeri genome ranging from 56% to 70%. This missing fraction needs to be resolved by further third generation sequencing efforts to study the role of repeats in biological processes such as aging.",gnd:4358905-4 gnd:1028601360 gnd:4156640-3 gnd:4378786-1
Quantum chemistry and surface hopping dynamics of azobenzenes : free and constrained models,"This cumulative doctoral dissertation, based on three publications, is devoted to the investigation of several aspects of azobenzene molecular switches, with the aid of computational chemistry.

Microbial siderophores in rhizophere interactions in heavy metal-containing environments,"Heavy metals may affect microbial and plant physiological processes in two ways: (i) an excess of the metals induces elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and ROS-induced oxidative stress, in turn, affects microbial and plant cellular and metabolic processes and hence, their growth. (ii) Metals interfere with iron acquisition, which, together with pH-induced insolubility, enhances iron deficiency symptoms in microbes and plants. Iron being essential, microbes and plants have evolved strategies for its acquisition. Basically, most microbes and graminaceous plants elicit low-molecular-weight, high-affinity, iron-scavenging compounds, siderophores. In contrast, dicotyledonous and non-grass monocotyledonous plants elaborate an increased iron reductase activity, coupled with release of phenolics and extrusion of protons. However, such plants can benefit from siderophore production by associated microbes. Despite their preference for iron, siderophores bind other metals, albeit with reduced affinity. Binding of siderophores to metals dramatically alters free metal concentrations and can, thus, play a bioprotective role in microbes and plants. Therefore, mechanisms that reduce the bioavailability of toxic metals in the environment for microbes, as well as provide plants with improved access to metals determine eco-toxicologically relevant metal concentrations in the soil, and their influence in microbe-assisted phytoremediation. The objective of the study was, therefore, to study the role of siderophores produced by Streptomyces spp in metal-induced microbial and plant rhizosphere processes and to evaluate their application in chelator-assisted phytoremediation of metal pollution.",gnd:4235006-2 gnd:4049846-3 gnd:4053964-7

Cosmic-ray neutron sensing for soil moisture measurements in cropped fields,"This cumulative dissertation explored the use of the detection of natural background of fast neutrons, the so-called cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRS) approach to measure field-scale soil moisture in cropped fields. Primary cosmic rays penetrate the top atmosphere and interact with atmospheric particles. Such interaction results on a cascade of high-energy neutrons, which continue traveling through the atmospheric column. Finally, neutrons penetrate the soil surface and a second cascade is produced with the so-called secondary cosmic-ray neutrons (fast neutrons). Partly, fast neutrons are absorbed by hydrogen (soil moisture). Remaining neutrons scatter back to the atmosphere, where its flux is inversely correlated to the soil moisture content, therefore allowing a non-invasive indirect measurement of soil moisture. The CRS methodology is mainly evaluated based on a field study carried out on a farmland in Potsdam (Brandenburg, Germany) along three crop seasons with corn, sunflower and winter rye; a bare soil period; and two winter periods. Also, field monitoring was carried out in the Schaefertal catchment (Harz, Germany) for long-term testing of CRS against ancillary data. In the first experimental site, the CRS method was calibrated and validated using different approaches of soil moisture measurements. In a period with corn, soil moisture measurement at the local scale was performed at near-surface only, and in subsequent periods (sunflower and winter rye) sensors were placed in three depths (5 cm, 20 cm and 40 cm). The direct transfer of CRS calibration parameters between two vegetation periods led to a large overestimation of soil moisture by the CRS. Part of this soil moisture overestimation was attributed to an underestimation of the CRS observation depth during the corn period ( 5-10 cm), which was later recalculated to values between 20-40 cm in other crop periods (sunflower and winter rye). According to results from these monitoring periods with different crops, vegetation played an important role on the CRS measurements. Water contained also in crop biomass, above and below ground, produces important neutron moderation. This effect was accounted for by a simple model for neutron corrections due to vegetation. It followed crop development and reduced overall CRS soil moisture error for periods of sunflower and winter rye. In Potsdam farmland also inversely-estimated soil hydraulic parameters were determined at the field scale, using CRS soil moisture from the sunflower period. A modelling framework coupling HYDRUS-1D and PEST was applied. Subsequently, field-scale soil hydraulic properties were compared against local scale soil properties (modelling and measurements). Successful results were obtained here, despite large difference in support volume. Simple modelling framework emphasizes future research directions with CRS soil moisture to parameterize field scale models. In Schaefertal catchment, CRS measurements were verified using precipitation and evapotranspiration data. At the monthly resolution, CRS soil water storage was well correlated to these two weather variables. Also clearly, water balance could not be closed due to missing information from other compartments such as groundwater, catchment discharge, etc. In the catchment, the snow influence to natural neutrons was also evaluated. As also observed in Potsdam farmland, CRS signal was strongly influenced by snow fall and snow accumulation. A simple strategy to measure snow was presented for Schaefertal case. Concluding remarks of this dissertation showed that (a) the cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRS) has a strong potential to provide feasible measurement of mean soil moisture at the field scale in cropped fields; (b) CRS soil moisture is strongly influenced by other environmental water pools such as vegetation and snow, therefore these should be considered in analysis; (c) CRS water storage can be used for soil hydrology modelling for determination of soil hydraulic parameters; and (d) CRS approach has strong potential for long term monitoring of soil moisture and for addressing studies of water balance.",gnd:4165371-3 gnd:4038852-9 gnd:4058056-8 gnd:4236526-0 gnd:4034434-4 gnd:4221352-6

Phase transitions between broken symmetry phases involve a change in symmetry and those between topological phases require a change in topological order; in rare cases, however, transitions may occur between these two broad classes of phases in which the vanishing of the topological order is accompanied by the emergence of a broken symmetry. This thesis describes observations of such a special phase transition in the two-dimensional electron gas confined in the GaAs/AlGaAs structures. When tuned by hydrostatic pressure, the ν = 5/2 and ν = 7/2 fractional quantum Hall states, believed to be prototypical non-Abelian topological phases of the Pfaffian universality class, give way to an electronic nematic phase. Remarkably, the fractional quantum Hall states involved are due to pairing of emergent particles called composite fermions. The findings reported here, therefore, provide an interesting example of competition of pairing and nematicity.

Model based construction of embedded & real-time software,"While model-based software engineering - due to its increased abstraction and its advantages in terms of traceability and analyzability - seems to be the adequate means to deal with the increased complexity of software that one faces today, it does not seem to have penetrated all domains yet, in particular not the one of small embedded & real-time systems. Seeing this problem caused by the fact that current model-based approaches do not pay sufficient attention to the rather special technical, organizational, and economical constraints in the respective domain, this work presents an approach that explicitly takes these constraints into account. MeDUSA, a model-based software construction method for small embedded & real-time systems, is a principal item of the presented solution. To face the strong technical constraints it was especially designed as an instance-driven method, not incorporating any object-oriented concepts, but forcing a class-based design that can be seamlessly transferred into a procedural implementation, which is still state-of- the-art in the regarded domain. To guarantee such a seamless transition MeDUSA was furthermore designed to be a software construction rather than a mere design method, explicitly also addressing the implementation activities ...",gnd:4233557-7 gnd:4131397-5 gnd:4396978-1 gnd:4076370-5 gnd:4469781-8 gnd:4134837-0

Finding Markovian models for insurance processes by expanding state spaces,"['Variable Length Markov Chains (VLMC) are a subclass of Markov processes. They are able to fully display dependencies in time-homogeneous data while being less complex than a Markov process of sufficiently large order. But VLMC fail to meet requirements of insurance applications, e.g. they cannot display time-dependencies in a natural way. In order to meet those requirements we extend the concept of VLMC and introduce a new class of models: time-inhomogeneous Variable Length Markov Chains (tiVLMC). We propose and implement a fitting algorithm for tiVLMC within an uncensored and a censored data setting. The calculation of prospective reserves is discussed and we train and tune tiVLMC-models on two real life data sets.

Worsening climate impacts are forcing subsistence farmers worldwide to decide between staying or leaving their homes. This mixed methods study analyzes cases of climate-related migration, displacement, relocation, and immobility in Peru\'s coastal, highland, and rainforest regions. The results reveal that numerous farmers experienced profound and often negative well-being impacts, regardless of whether they stayed or migrated. The higher the structural constraints, such as weak governance, and the more damaging the climate impacts were, the higher the risk of well-being declines. Additionally, the affected individuals often had limited agency and ability to mitigate losses. These findings challenge the notion of ""migration as adaptation"" and emphasize the importance of safeguarding the human rights and security of those affected while addressing loss and damage. Without significant investments in such efforts, climate impacts could sharply diminish the well-being of numerous subsistence farmers worldwide—irrespective of whether they stay or migrate.

Searches for CP Violation in Charmed Meson Decays : A Study of D+ → K - K+ ∏+ at the LHCb Experiment,"Our current understanding of the fundamental building blocks of the Universe, summarised by the Standard Model of particle physics, is incomplete. For example, it fails to explain why we do not see equal, or almost equal, numbers of particles and their antiparticle partners. To explain this asymmetry requires, among other effects, a mechanism known as charge-parity (CP) violation that causes differences between the rates at which particles and antiparticles decay. CP violation is seen in systems containing bottom and strange quarks, but not in those with up, charm or top quarks. This thesis describes searches for particle-antiparticle asymmetries in the decay rates of charmed mesons. No evidence of CP violation is found. With current sensitivities, an asymmetry large enough to observe probably could not be explained by the Standard Model. Instead an explanation could come from new physics, for example contributions from supersymmetric or other undiscovered heavy particles. In the thesis, the development of new techniques to search for these asymmetries is described. They are applied to data from the LHCb experiment at CERN to make precise measurements of asymmetries in the D^+->K^-K^+pi^+ decay channel. This is the most promising charged D decay for CP violation searches",gnd:4067675-4 gnd:4252994-3 gnd:1072161370 gnd:4314771-9
Automated seismic event location by waveform coherence analysis$nElektronische Ressource,"Automated location of seismic events is a very important task in microseismic monitoring operations as well for local and regional seismic monitoring. Since microseismic records are generally characterised by low signal-to-noise ratio, such methods are requested to be noise robust and sufficiently accurate. Most of the standard automated location routines are based on the automated picking, identification and association of the first arrivals of P and S waves and on the minimization of the residuals between theoretical and observed arrival times of the considered seismic phases. Although current methods can accurately pick P onsets, the automatic picking of the S onset is still problematic, especially when the P coda overlaps the S wave onset. In this thesis I developed a picking free automated method based on the Short-Term-Average/Long-Term-Average (STA/LTA) traces at different stations as observed data. I used the STA/LTA of several characteristic functions in order to increase the sensitiveness to the P wave and the S waves. For the P phases we use the STA/LTA traces of the vertical energy function, while for the S phases, we use the STA/LTA traces of the horizontal energy trace and then a more optimized characteristic function which is obtained using the principal component analysis technique. The orientation of the horizontal components can be retrieved by robust and linear approach of waveform comparison between stations within a network using seismic sources outside the network (chapter 2). To locate the seismic event, we scan the space of possible hypocentral locations and origin times, and stack the STA/LTA traces along the theoretical arrival time surface for both P and S phases. Iterating this procedure on a three-dimensional grid we retrieve a multidimensional matrix whose absolute maximum corresponds to the spatial and temporal coordinates of the seismic event. Location uncertainties are then estimated by perturbing the STA/LTA parameters (i.e the length of both long and short time windows) and relocating each event several times. In order to test the location method I firstly applied it to a set of 200 synthetic events. Then we applied it to two different real datasets. A first one related to mining induced microseismicity in a coal mine in the northern Germany (chapter 3). In this case we successfully located 391 microseismic event with magnitude range between 0.5 and 2.0 Ml. To further validate the location method I compared the retrieved locations with those obtained by manual picking procedure. The second dataset consist in a pilot application performed in the Campania-Lucania region (southern Italy) using a 33 stations seismic network (Irpinia Seismic Network) with an aperture of about 150 km (chapter 4). We located 196 crustal earthquakes (depth < 20 km) with magnitude range 1.1 < Ml < 2.7. A subset of these locations were compared with accurate locations retrieved by a manual location procedure based on the use of a double difference technique. In both cases results indicate good agreement with manual locations. Moreover, the waveform stacking location method results noise robust and performs better than classical location methods based on the automatic picking of the P and S waves first arrivals.",gnd:4003957-2 gnd:4040936-3 gnd:4502320-7 gnd:4123037-1 gnd:4180762-5 gnd:4131193-0 gnd:4385254-3 gnd:4273109-4 gnd:4189545-9 gnd:4730029-2 gnd:4116468-4 gnd:4303176-6 gnd:4473894-8 gnd:4057195-6 gnd:4172886-5 gnd:4176425-0 gnd:4152638-7 gnd:4493268-6 gnd:4152551-6
Trait-based understanding of plant species distributions along environmental gradients,"For more than two centuries, plant ecologists have aimed to understand how environmental gradients and biotic interactions shape the distribution and co-occurrence of plant species. In recent years, functional trait–based approaches have been increasingly used to predict patterns of species co-occurrence and species distributions along environmental gradients (trait–environment relationships). Functional traits are measurable properties at the individual level that correlate well with important processes. Thus, they allow us to identify general patterns by synthesizing studies across specific taxonomic compositions, thereby fostering our understanding of the underlying processes of species assembly. However, the importance of specific processes have been shown to be highly dependent on the spatial scale under consideration. In particular, it remains uncertain which mechanisms drive species assembly and allow for plant species coexistence at smaller, more local spatial scales. [...]",gnd:4601495-0
Cultural Heritage on Mobile Devices : Building Guidelines for UNESCO World Heritage Sites' Apps,"Technological improvements and access provide a fertile scenario for creating and developing mobile applications (apps). This scenario results in a myriad of Apps providing information regarding touristic destinations, including those with a cultural profile, such as those dedicated to UNESCO World Heritage Sites (WHS). However, not all of the Apps have the same efficiency. In order to have a successful app, its development must consider usability aspects and features aligned with reliable content. Despite the guidelines for mobile usability being broadly available, they are generic, and none of them concentrates specifically into cultural heritage places, especially on those placed in an open-air scenario. This research aims to fulfil this literature gap and discusses how to adequate and develop specific guidelines for a better outdoor WHS experience. It uses an empirical approach applied to an open-air WHS city: Weimar and its Bauhaus and Classical Weimar sites. In order to build a new set of guidelines applied for open-air WHS, this research used a systematic approach to compare literature-based guidelines to industry-based ones (based on affordances), extracted from the available Apps dedicated to WHS set in Germany. The instructions compiled from both sources have been comparatively tested by using two built prototypes from the distinctive guidelines, creating a set of recommendations collecting the best approach from both sources, plus suggesting new ones the evaluation.",gnd:7689895-7 gnd:4264875-0 gnd:4402276-1 gnd:4005541-3

Enzymatic degradation of synthetic polymers,"[""This work investigated the enzymatic degradation of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) (ArticlesI and II) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) (Article III). Physical or chemical degradation of plastic polymers is often performed under extreme conditions like high temperatures or pressure. In comparison to that, recycling of plastics with enzymes can be carried out at ambient temperatures and neutral pH. Enzymes themselves are non- toxic, environmentally friendly, and have been used successfully in a variety of industrial processes. Enzymatic degradation of polyesters is well studied. Their heteroatomic backbone, which is connecting monomers via ester bonds offers a target for an enzymatic attack. Especially PET, one of the most common polyesters, has been in the focus of research. The first enzyme capable of degrading the polymer was found in 2005. Since then, researchers discovered several enzymes with similar functions and subjected them to enzyme engineering. Improving the enzyme's substrate affinity, activity, and stability aims at making PET recycling more efficient. Article I provides an overview of limitations that enzymatic PET recycling is still facing and the research carried out to overcome them.

Mikropolare Zweiphasenmodelle : Formulierung auf der Basis der Theorie poröser Medien,"In the presented work, a theoretical description of multi-phase materials is presented. Basis is the Theory of Porous Media, which is extended by elements of the micropolar theory in order to take into account the influence of the microstructur.

The attention is focused on the extensions according to the independent rotations which arise in the framework of the micropolar theory. Furthermore, from the master balance equation the structure of the individual balances for the constituents is derived and related to the balance equations of the mixture as a whole. For a two-phase material consisting of elastic porous skeleton and a viscous pore-fluid thermodynamical consistent constitutive relations are derived from the evaluation of the entropy prinicple. Specially, an evolution equation for the volume fraction is introduced. This is of interest because this equation does not follow from kinematical considerations in the case of compressible constituents. Finally, to become more concrete, the solid skeleton is assumed to be elastic and a strain energy functions is given.

Scalable data profiling : distributed discovery and analysis of structural metadata,"Data profiling is the act of extracting structural metadata from datasets. Structural metadata, such as data dependencies and statistics, can support data management operations, such as data integration and data cleaning. Data management often is the most time-consuming activity in any data-related project. Its support is extremely valuable in our data-driven world, so that more time can be spent on the actual utilization of the data, e. g., building analytical models. In most scenarios, however, structural metadata is not given and must be extracted first. Therefore, efficient data profiling methods are highly desirable. Data profiling is a computationally expensive problem; in fact, most dependency discovery problems entail search spaces that grow exponentially in the number of attributes. To this end, this thesis introduces novel discovery algorithms for various types of data dependencies – namely inclusion dependencies, conditional inclusion dependencies, partial functional dependencies, and partial unique column combinations – namely inclusion dependencies, conditional inclusion dependencies, partial functional dependencies, and partial unique column combinations – that considerably improve over state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of efficiency and that scale to datasets that cannot be processed by existing algorithms.

"A decision support model for waste management in support of developing low carbon, eco region : case studies of densely populated kampung setllements in urban areas in Jakarta","['Due to the various types of waste disposal, treatment, utilization and technologies, decision support model for waste management is needed to assist planners and decision makers in finding most suitable way to manage municipal solid waste efficiently. Many planners and decision makers in the area of municipal solid waste have a lack of thorough understanding of the complex chains of waste management system. Therefore the impact for the environment quality and the public health can only be judged at the rudimentary level. However, most existing models are primarily focusing on cost or environmental analysis. Only few consider other crucial factors such as the demographic condition, the characteristics of urban form and urban infrastructure, land transformation aspects due to urban development. Consequently, such models often meet difficulties to cope with cultural requirement. Based on those reasons, a decision support model to set up alternatives of most appropriate technology for sustainable waste management towards a low carbon eco-city on a regional basis is developed in this PhD study. The Low Carbon- and Eco-Region, in particular the contribution of waste management sector, is a vision of living in low rate of carbon generation, using fewer natural resources, and encouraging energy recovery and/or waste reduction at source by improving the used material quality (up-cycling). This decision support model is constructed mainly based on the cultural requirement and local context of a region and synergize the geographic, environmental, social capital and economics aspects in order to fulfill the needs of the respective region and its society. The method employed in this model is not solely a new developed model, but also an advanced model in material flow analysis (STAN), and life cycle assessment on solid waste system (EASEWASTE) and Geographic Information System (GIS).

Bridging the gap between precise RT-level power/timing estimation and fast high-level simulation : a method for automatically identifying and characterising combinational macros in synchronous sequential systems at register-transfer level and subsequent executable high-level model generation with respect to non-functional properties,"['This thesis tackles the problem of a fast, yet accurate power and timing estimation of embedded HW modules at a high-level of abstraction. By augmenting an executable high-level model with accurate power and timing information, fast and comprehensive simulations at a high-level of abstraction become possible. Using HLS, a behavioural system description is transformed into a cycle-accurate description at RTL. Combinational macros are identified and characterised automatically, using sophisticated RT-level power models. These provide accurate estimates, while considering as many relevant physical properties and synthesis artefacts as possible. A power and timing annotated high-level simulation model is then generated. This virtual prototype allows a fast, yet accurate estimation of the design. The generated prototype can also be embedded into a virtual system prototype allowing a DSE, far more complex and comprehensive than would be feasible before. Evaluation results show that by having an average relative error per cycle of less than 6.93% and a total error of around 1%, a speed-up of 160x is archived, while giving nearly cycle-accurate estimates. <engl.>', 'Diese Arbeit adressiert das Problem schneller aber dennoch genauer Abschätzungen des zeitlichen Verhaltens eingebetteter HW Module sowie deren Verlustleistung.

Bank erosion in alluvial rivers with non-cohesive soil in unsteady flow,"['So far the theory of bank failure in non-cohesive soils is limited to the avalanche of loose, not compacted, fully saturated discrete grains, applicable mainly to gravel banks. However, the present field investigation indicated that undercutting of the riverbank, slip failure of the submerged zone of the bank, as well as cantilever failure of the overhang are the dominant processes in non-cohesive dense (sandy) soils under unsteady flow conditions. These processes have been modelled in the present work by an innovative method, which has been validated by field measurements. The results showed that the method enhanced the simulation accuracy up to six times in comparison to the earlier methods.', 'Bislang ist die Theorie der Böschungsbruchvorgänge für kohäsionslosen Boden auf ebenen Gleitfugen in einem rollenden, nicht verdichteten und voll gesättigten Boden mit diskreten Körnern begrenzt und damit vor allem für Kiesboden anwendbar.

Damage tolerance of refill friction stir spot weld application for the aircraft industry,"['Refill Friction Stir Spot Welding (Refill FSSW) is a solid-state process technology that is suitable for welding lightweight materials in similar or dissimilar overlapped configuration. It has proven to be a very promising new joining technique; especially, for high strength aluminum alloys, which has presented large advantages when compared to conventional welding processes. Currently, Refill FSSW is recognized as a potential alternative for riveted structure; it allows an increasing of the manufacturing cost effectiveness owing to sensible cost reduction and structural efficiency. The main aim of this work is to study the mechanical behavior and crack propagation in joints produced by Refill FSSSW. The study is focused on the application of the damage tolerance design philosophy in integral structures produced by Refill FSSSW in aluminum alloy AA2024-T3. Up to now the process development and the mechanical performance study has been mostly empirical. Thus, a transition to a science-based approach is highly necessary. The work presented here was conducted to stablish a relationship of experimental investigation and a set of numerical models that can be used for design optimization and fatigue crack growth analysis. Beforehand, the welded joints were assessed mechanically and metallurgically in order to investigate the mechanism and the optimization of the process parameters (rotation speed, welding time and plunge depth) in terms of quasi-static loading and fatigue loading. This investigation has assisted the development of the structural numerical models, where two structural models have been developed to study the design optimization. The first model covers the stress analysis, load transferred by friction, stress concentration and peak stress location; it was built considering the structural and cohesive approach. The second numerical model considers the embedded approach; it can be used for parametric studies with good accuracy. Then, the design optimization was developed considering the distances: number of spot welds rows, spot weld row spacing, spot weld pitch in row and distance of the spot weld from the sheet edge. The developments of the distances were performed considering its performance in quasi-static and fatigue loading. A fractography analysis at various fracture modes has been performed. This is necessary in order to understand and described the crack propagation according the fracture mechanics. Then, a numerical model has developed and calibrated in order to obtain stress intensity factors for the cracks described previously. The numerical model has been built with the eXtended Finite Element Method. Finally, the thesis deals with crack propagation and residual strength of Refill FSSW in thin panels for aircraft fuselage applications. Detailed experimental investigation has been carried out in panels FSSW in order to understand the crack propagation under different failure scenario. Moreover, the experimental results have been used to verify and calibrate the developed fatigue crack growth numerical model. The model has been used to simulate crack propagation in different joint configuration and initial cracks. The numerical model has been built with the eXtended Finite Element Method. The results have shown good agreement of the predict fatigue life with the experimental results. Then, both eXtended Finite Element Method models numerical models developed have been used for residual strength prediction of cracked unstiffened panels in terms of the stress intensity factor. The results obtained in the course of this study have shown the feasibility of Refill FSSW to produce high strength joints as well as the importance of the joint design, in which can be significantly improved by using the correct distances. The knowledge about the structural behavior and extent of crack propagation gained from the numerical models is valuable to understanding the influence of secondary bending on cracked panels and the development of residual strength diagrams.', 'Reibpunktschweißen ist ein Festphasen-Schweißverfahren, das zum Schweißen von Leichtbauwerkstoffen in ähnlicher oder unähnlicher Überlappverbindungen für die Konfiguration geeignet ist.

Gegenwärtig wird Reibpunktschweißen als eine mögliche Alternative für eine genietete Struktur anerkannt. Es ermöglicht eine Erhöhung der Herstellungskosteneffektivität aufgrund einer vernünftigen Kostenreduzierung und strukturellen Effizienz. Das Hauptziel dieser Arbeit ist es, das mechanische Verhalten und die Rissausbreitung in Verbindungen zu untersuchen, die von Reibpunktschweißen verursacht werden. Die Studie konzentriert sich auf die Anwendung der Schadenstoleranz in integralen Strukturen von Reibpunktschweißen in Aluminiumlegierung AA2024-T3 hergestellt. Bisher waren die Prozessentwicklung und die mechanische Leistungsstudie überwiegend empirisch. Daher ist ein Übergang zu einem wissenschaftsbasierten Ansatz dringend erforderlich. Die hier vorgestellte Arbeit wurde durchgeführt, um eine Beziehung zwischen der experimentellen Erforschung und numerischen Modellen zu etablieren, die für die Entwurfsoptimierung und Ermüdungsrisswachstumsanalyse verwendet werden können. Davor wurden die Schweißverbindungen mechanisch und metallurgisch beurteilt, um die Optimierung der Prozessparameter (Drehzahl, Schweißdauer und Eindringtiefe) für Festigkeit und Ermüdungsbelastung zu untersuchen. Diese Untersuchung zeigt die Entwicklung der strukturellen numerischen Modelle, wo zwei strukturelle Modelle entwickelt wurden, um die Entwurfsoptimierung zu analysieren. Das erste Modell umfasst die Spannungsanalyse, die Last, die durch Reibung übertragen wird, die Spannungskonzentration und die Position der Höchstspannung. Es wurde unter Berücksichtigung des strukturellen und kohäsiven Ansatzes gebaut. Das zweite numerische Modell berücksichtigt den eingebetteten Ansatz; es kann für parametrische Studien mit guter Genauigkeit verwendet werden. Dann wurde die Entwurfsoptimierung unter Berücksichtigung der Abstände entwickelt: Anzahl der Schweißpunktreihen, Punktschweißreihenabstand, Punktschweißabstand in der Reihe und Abstand der Punktschweißung von der Blechkante. Die Entwicklungen der Entfernungen wurden unter Berücksichtigung ihrer Leistung in quasi-statischen und Ermüdungsbelastung durchgeführt. Eine fraktographische Analyse bei verschiedenen Brucharten wurde durchgeführt. Dies ist notwendig, um die Rissausbreitung nach der Bruchmechanik zu verstehen und zu beschreiben. Dann wurde ein numerisches Modell entwickelt und kalibriert, um Spannungsintensitätsfaktoren für die zuvor beschriebenen Risse zu erhalten. Das numerische Modell wurde mit der eXtended Finite Element Methode erstellt. Abschließend behandelt die Arbeit die Rissausbreitung und Restfestigkeit von Reibpunktschweißen in dünnen Platten für Flugzeugrumpfanwendungen. In dem Vollmaßstab wurde eine detaillierte experimentelle Untersuchung durchgeführt, um die Rissausbreitung unter verschiedenen Versagensszenarien zu verstehen. Darüber hinaus wurden die experimentellen Ergebnisse verwendet, um das entwickelte Modell des Ermüdungsrisswachstums zu verifizieren und zu kalibrieren. Das Modell wurde verwendet, um die Rissausbreitung in verschiedenen Verbindungskonfigurationen und anfänglichen Rissen zu simulieren. Das numerische Modell wurde mit der eXtended Finite Element Methode erstellt. Die Ergebnisse zeigen eine gute Übereinstimmung der Vorhersage-Ermüdungslebensdauer mit den experimentellen Ergebnissen. Dann wurden beide Modelle der Finite-Elemente-Methode für die Restfestigkeitsvorhersage von gecrackten unversteiften Platten hinsichtlich des Spannungsintensitätsfaktors verwendet. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass Reibpunktschweißen sowohl hochfeste Verbindungen herstellen kann als auch die Bedeutung des Gelenkdesigns, bei dem durch Verwendung der richtigen Abstände, eine signifikante Verbesserung erzielt werden kann.

Charge carrier recombination and open circuit voltage in organic solar cells : from bilayer-model systems to hybrid multi-junctions,"Tremendous progress in the development of thin film solar cell techniques has been made over the last decade. The field of organic solar cells is constantly developing, new material classes like Perowskite solar cells are emerging and different types of hybrid organic/inorganic material combinations are being investigated for their physical properties and their applicability in thin film electronics. Besides typical single-junction architectures for solar cells, multi-junction concepts are also being investigated as they enable the overcoming of theoretical limitations of a single-junction. In multi-junction devices each sub-cell operates in different wavelength regimes and should exhibit optimized band-gap energies. It is exactly this tunability of the band-gap energy that renders organic solar cell materials interesting candidates for multi-junction applications.

Subsequently, the impact of the LHC Higgs results on scenarios of new physics is assessed in detail, including a careful discussion of the relevant uncertainties. Two approaches are considered: generic modifications of the Higgs couplings, possibly arising from extended Higgs sectors or higher-dimensional operators; and tests of specific new physics models. Lastly, the implications of the null results of the searches for new physics are discussed with a particular focus on supersymmetric dark matter candidates.

"""Institutions and entrepreneurship""","Based on five research papers, the dissertation ""Institutions and Entrepreneurship"" analyzes institutional influences on entrepreneurship, as well as determinants and effects of institutional change. In particular, the effects of implicit institutions, i.e. societal norms and values, on the occupational choice of becoming an entrepreneur, are investigated. Using the German history of separation and reunification as quasi-natural experiment, the thesis finds that the East Germans' preference structure significantly differs from the preference structure of the West German control group, thus constituting an obstacle to entrepreneurship in East Germany. The thesis shows that these differences in the implicit institutions result from the Socialist Regime in the German Democratic Republic (GDR), and investigates various channels by which those institutions where formed. Particularly, the dissertation identifies the effects of education and schooling in the GDR on the formation of entrepreneurial preferences. Moreover, the thesis evaluates the effectiveness of several measures of entrepreneurship education at German universities. In a diff-in-diff framework, the analysis finds significant differences in the effects of the introduction of chairs for entrepreneurship, the participation in the publicly funded EXIST-program, and the simultaneous application of both measures, on students' attitude towards entrepreneurship as occupational alternative. Eventually, the dissertation takes a more general view on institutional change an identifies effects of the introduction of the Internet on voting behavior. Using a distance-based Instrumental Variables approach, the thesis shows that the introduction of the Internet significantly decreased voter turnout in Germany. However, it is rather the established parties that could benefit from the new medium, while small and particularly fringe parties tend to lose vote shares due to the introduction of the Internet.",gnd:4133767-0

Investigating noncommutative structures : quantum groups and dual groups in the context of quantum probability,"['The history of Mathematics has been lead in part by the desire for generalization: once an object was given and had been understood, there was the desire to find a more general version of it, to fit it into a broader framework. Noncommutative Mathematics fits into this description, as its interests are objects analoguous to vector spaces, or probability spaces, etc., but without the commonsense interpretation that those latter objects possess. Indeed, a space can be described by its points, but also and equivalently, by the set of functions on this space. This set is actually a commutative algebra, sometimes equipped with some more structure: *-algebra, C*-algebra, von Neumann algebras, Hopf algebras, etc. The idea that lies at the basis of noncommutative Mathematics is to replace such algebras by algebras that are not necessarily commutative any more and to interpret them as ""algebras of functions on noncommutative spaces"". Of course, these spaces do not exist independently from their defining algebras, but facts show that a lot of the results holding in (classical) probability or (classical) group theory can be extended to their noncommutative counterparts, or find therein powerful analogues.

Vegetation and biomass are sampled along an elevation-gradient between 1997 and 1999. In 2000 a space-for-time substitution compares the restoration site to a polder and an undisturbed brackish grassland and the progress of succession is evaluated. The vegetation of brackish grasslands is classified. The impact of a rising sea level is estimated based on amplitudes of species groups relative to main site factors. The degree of vegetation change is positively related to inundation. The vegetation of the depressions experiences a complete die-off whereas for the higher zones there is a continuous adaptation to salinity and inundation to be observed. At the landward border of brackish grasslands no directed change occurs even 7 years after de-embankment. Cattle grazing preserves pioneer vegetation in the depressions while it facilitates the establishment of brackish grasslands beyond. Assessments of hemeroby and the composition of strategy types reveal that both naturalness and complexity increase with inundation. The restoration of coastal grasslands is favoured by an effective drainage. Three to four years after deembankment at the earliest, brackish grasslands colonize the restoration site.

Regional water balance analysis of glacierised river basins in the north-eastern Himalaya applying the J2000 hydrological model,"The glacierised basins of the Northeast Himalayan region are highly vulnerable to climate-change impacts. The spatio-temporal hydroclimatic and physiographic variability impact the water balance of these glacierised basins across the region. This study assesses the glaciohydrological processes and dynamics in the data scarce region for the present as well future climate change scenarios by regional water balance analysis. The J2000 hydrological model was adapted to incorporate the frozen ground as well as glacier dynamics in a stepwise, nested basin calibration approach. The modelled ERA-Interim precipitation data cannot capture the high amplitude orographic and convective events. Therefore, Orographic correction factors were used to inversely correct the ERA-Interim precipitation data to account for the orographic as well as cyclonic precipitation in the region from reported glacier mass balance and evapotranspiration estimates. Monthly temperature lapse rate was adopted for correcting the ERA-Interim temperature dataset. The Beki basin was selected as the donor basin for model development and evaluation. The parameters from the Beki basin were regionalised to the receptor Lohit and the Noadihing basins by the Proxy-basin method. Multi-objective optimization criteria such as the Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) for temporal dynamics and flow distribution and Bias for overall water balance showed high to moderate conformity between measured and simulated discharge at the corresponding basin outlets. The variability in the water balance and runoff components among the three basins was primarily related to the spatio-temporal variation in the mean annual precipitation, runoff and evapotranspiration estimates. The impact of climate-change scenarios on the study basins indicated that water availability would sustain until the end of the century due to higher projected precipitation even though after the depletion of glaciers in the region.",gnd:4189181-8 gnd:4129794-5 gnd:4079058-7
Hybrid materials based on water-soluble polymers : preparation and application in sensing and photocatalysis,"This thesis describes the strategies for the innovative design of polymeric organic-inorganic hybrid materials using the development of synthetic approaches. The key objective of reported designs here is the excellent engineering of organic and inorganic building units that can successfully organize into target architecture of hybrid materials with ordered structures.

The last part is focusing on exploring the performance of copolymer-containing hybrid materials in various applications.

Charge transport in organic crystals,"The understanding of charge transport is one of the central goals in the research on semiconducting crystals. For organic crystals this is particularly complicated due to the strength of the electron-phonon interaction which requires the description of a seamless transition between the limiting cases of a coherent band-transport mechanism and incoherent hopping. In this thesis, charge transport phenomena in organic crystals are studied by theoretical means. A theory for charge transport in organic crystals is developed which covers the whole temperature range from low T, where it reproduces an expression from the Boltzmann equation for band transport, via elevated T, where it generalizes Holstein's small-polaron theory to finite bandwidths, up to high T, for which a temperature dependence equal to Marcus' electron-transfer theory is obtained. Thereby, coherent band transport and thermally induced hopping are treated on equal footing while simultaneously treating the electron-phonon interaction non-perturbatively. By avoiding the approximation of narrow polaron bands the theory allows for the description of large and small polarons and serves as a starting point for computational studies.",gnd:4210733-7 gnd:4172782-4

DNA-Überstrukturen für neuartige Konzepte in der plasmonischen Sensorik,"A core element of the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) sensors is their suitability as a transducer, which converts the binding event into a measurable signal. Since the strength of the signal depends on the electromagnetic field of the nanoparticle and the surrounding medium, signal amplification methods such as directional resonance coupling with biofunctionalized gold nanocubes and self-organizing structures such as hybridization chain reaction (HCR) and DNA origami can be applied. DNA nanotechnology enables optimization of nanostructure design and improvement of sensitivity and detection limits of LSPR sensors for future point-of-care (POC) detection systems. DNA-origami-gold-nanocube-dimers as nanosensors represent an approach for highly sensitive single-molecule detection. A protocol was developed which enabled the biofunctionalization of surfactant-capped gold nanocubes. Another approach for highly sensitive detection is the combination of HCR and LSPR for the detection of a microRNA specific for asymptotic lung cancer. Here, linear amplification is employed to increase the low sensitivity of label-free, LSPR-based biosensors and to specifically detect concentrations of 1 pM analyte, which is within the detection range for body fluids typical for miRNA. Since the volume of each analyte injection was 50 μL, the LSPR biosensor can detect about 50 attomole miRNA. The ability to work with such small volumes of diluted miRNA solution should make the biosensor method compatible with the available volumes of patient samples from liquid biopsies and the required preliminary sample processing procedures. The biosensor presented is practical, simple, scalable, powerful, and suitable for the point-of-care detection of miRNA in the future. The work presented was thus able to demonstrate the potential of DNA nanotechnology for LSPR-based biosensor technology in various ways.",gnd:4333369-2 gnd:4070512-2 gnd:1178162826 gnd:4327470-5 gnd:4274473-8

However, Germany still doesn’t have a specific veteran’s policy, in contrast to most of its allies. This lack of a veteran’s policy and the implications of that for the relationship between the German military and civil society are analysed in this book.

Modeling and understanding dynamics of charged particles in the Earth's inner magnetosphere,"The Earth's inner magnetosphere is a very dynamic system, mostly driven by the external solar wind forcing exerted upon the magnetic field of our planet. Disturbances in the solar wind, such as coronal mass ejections and co-rotating interaction regions, cause geomagnetic storms, which lead to prominent changes in charged particle populations of the inner magnetosphere - the plasmasphere, ring current, and radiation belts. Satellites operating in the regions of elevated energetic and relativistic electron fluxes can be damaged by deep dielectric or surface charging during severe space weather events. Predicting the dynamics of the charged particles and mitigating their effects on the infrastructure is of particular importance, due to our increasing reliance on space technologies. The dynamics of particles in the plasmasphere, ring current, and radiation belts are strongly coupled by means of collisions and collisionless interactions with electromagnetic fields induced by the motion of charged particles.

Die relevante Zeitskala ist das Verhältnis von Entschlaufungszeit und Kristallisationszeit. Innerhalb der Kristallisationszeit wächst die Lamelle den End-zu-End-Abstand der Kette. Es werden zwei Kristallisationsregime gefunden. Bei schneller Kristallisation ist die Entschlaufungszeit größer als die Kristallisationszeit. Die Kette kann ihre Konformation nicht global ändern und es können nicht alle Verschlaufungen während der Kristallisation aufgelöst werden. Im Fall der langsamen Kristallisation kann sich die Kette global reorganisieren und es können alle Verschlaufungen aufgelöst werden. Die relevanten Zeiten wurden experimentell bestimmt. Die Untersuchung der teilkristallinen Struktur zeigte unterschiedliche Konformationsänderungen für die beiden Kristallisationsregime. Globale Konformationsänderungen müssen während der langsamen Kristallisation stattfinden, wenn die Langperiode der teilkristallinen Struktur größer als die Kette in der Schmelze ist. Im Temperatur- und Molekulargewichtsbereich der schnellen Kristallisation ist die Lamellendicke kleiner als die Kettengröße in der Schmelze. Die Lamellendicke ist in diesem Regime unabhängig vom Molekulargewicht. Die Kette hat ihre Konformation während der Kristallisation nur lokal geändert.

The search for substellar companions to subdwarf B stars in connection with evolutionary aspects,"The formation and evolution of single hot subdwarf B stars is not entirely understood. Enhanced mass loss during the red giant phase is a prerequisite to explain the very existence of these stars, yet its cause is a matter of debate. One hypothesis predicts that substellar companions like brown dwarfs and exoplanets may be able to have a decisive influence on the formation and evolution of single subdwarf B stars. This dissertation investigates two pulsating subdwarf B stars with the goal to search for substellar companions and to directly measure the evolutionary timescales. The long-term multi-site photometric data were taken in the framework of the EXOTIME (EXOplanet search with the TIming MEthod) program and cover a baseline of several tens of months. The secular behaviour of several pulsations in each target is investigated by applying a timing method and constructing O-C (Observed minus Calculated) diagrams. The analysis results in the fundamental insight that both targets are in a phase of global expansion, that their pulsation periods increase on a timescale of several million years and that the two target stars have probably already undergone core Helium exhaustion. Furthermore, the O-C diagrams show evidence for the presence of substellar companions. The star HS0444+0458 has a brown dwarf companion candidate of roughly 31 Jupiter masses in an orbit of 0.27 astronomical units. An exoplanet candidate of 5.6 Jupiter masses is found to orbit its host star HS0702+6043 at a distance of 1.15 astronomical units. These detections provide a direct support for a formation channel of single subdwarf B stars that includes substellar companions as the mass loss trigger.",gnd:4287102-5 gnd:4462534-0 gnd:4456110-6
The geochemical response of sedimentary archives to rapid recent glacier retreat at the western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) : from source to sink : von der Quelle zur Senke,"['Off King George Island (western Antarctic Peninsula) major and trace elements were studied in porewaters and sedimentary archives.

Using guano-associated bio-elements in lake sediments the waxing and waning of local penguin colonies on Ardley Island could be reconstructed. Changes in local penguin populations during the Holocene are linked to changes in climate, sea ice extent, relative sea level and volcanic eruptions.

Every two months the growth of fungi, the change in brightness and other parameters have been determined. A comparison between the binder systems showed, that the growth on different copolymers could be identical. Therefore, the influence of the copolymers was less distinct. All binders showed more growth with increasing pvc, i.e. with decreasing amount. The pure values of the glass transition temperature Tg and minimum filmforming temperature MFT allow not always a definite predication. The water regime of the paints exert a strong influence on the fungal growth. The hydrophobicity of the paint had no effect on the growth.

Getting respected despite our differences : (re-)establishing positive relations through a respectful treatment,"Can respect help to re-establish social relations within and between groups- also in situations of intergroup conflict? In the present lines of research, I propose respect to be of fundamental importance for social cohesion within and between groups. I conceive of respect as recognition as an equal (Honneth, 1995, Simon, 2007) and develop an integrative conceptualization and measurement in order to examine its role for intergroup reconciliation (Chapter 2 and 4). I present two studies examining the distinct influence of respect and disrespect as compared to a neutral condition at first within groups and then between groups (Chapter 3). Within groups, a respectful treatment seems equivalent to a neutral treatment and both increased group identification, group-serving motivation, and category salience equivalently when compared to a disrespectful treatment. As opposed, a respectful treatment between groups decreased category salience compared to disrespectful treatment and may benefit to overcome intergroup boundaries. In the context of intergroup conflict, I present five studies (Chapter 5-7) examining the role of respect on the willingness to reconcile between victims and perpetrators (Shnabel & Nadler, 2008). Here, I focused on how the willingness to reconcile is affected by a respectful message in addition to needs-based messages, or alone. Results revealed that respect had a consistent effect on the willingness to reconcile of victims, in addition to the needs-based message. More importantly perceived respect was the central mediating process between manipulated respect and the willingness to reconcile for victims and perpetrators. I discuss theoretical and practical implications of respect for relations within and between groups as well as methodological limitations and challenges in the experimental study of respect (Chapter 8).",gnd:4022378-4 gnd:4058881-6 gnd:4078782-5 gnd:4063213-1 gnd:4027266-7 gnd:4141283-7 gnd:4145198-3

Model checking of software for microcontrollers,"Software of microcontrollers is getting more and more complex. It is mandatory to extensively analyze their software as errors can lead to severe failures or cause high costs. Model checking is a formal method used to verify whether a system satisfies certain properties. This thesis describes a new approach for model checking software for microcontrollers. In this approach, assembly code is used for model checking instead of an intermediate representation such as C code. The development of [mc]square, which is a microcontroller assembly code model checker implementing this approach, is detailed. [mc]square has a modular architecture to cope with the hardware dependency of this approach. The single steps of the model checking process are divided into separate packages. The creation of the states is conducted by a specific simulator, which is the only hardware-dependent package. Within the simulator, the different microcontrollers are modeled accurately. This work describes the modeling of the ATMEL ATmega16 microcontroller and details implemented abstraction techniques, which are used to tackle the state-explosion problem. These abstraction techniques include lazy interrupt evaluation, lazy stack evaluation, delayed nondeterminism, dead variable reduction, and path reduction. Delayed nondeterminism introduces symbolic states, which represent a set of states, into [mc]square while still explicit model checking techniques are used. Thus, we successfully combined explicit and symbolic model checking techniques. A formal model of the simulator, which we developed to prove the correctness of abstraction techniques, is described. In this work, the formal model is used to show the correctness of delayed nondeterminism. To show the applicability of the approach, two case studies are described. In these case studies, we used programs of different sizes. All these programs were created by students in lab courses, during  diploma theses, or in exercises without the intention to use them for model checking.",gnd:4434799-6 gnd:4127438-6
Colour development and pigment characterisation in flowers of Papaver nudicaule and Papaver rhoeas,"The present thesis extended the knowledge about floral pigments and volatiles and their role in plant-pollinator interaction in two widely distributed Papaver species. The bright red flowers of P. rhoeas, the corn poppy, are characterised by a highly variable colouration in the UV-A wavelength range depending on geographical distribution. This colour polymorphism was found to be caused by different flavonol contents. While Eastern Mediterranean flowers with negligible UV reflectance produced flavonol glycosides, Central European flowers with substantial UV reflectance lacked these pigments almost completely. The flavonol structures consisted of kaempferol and quercetin aglycones with 3-O-glycosylation. Flavonoid biosynthesis is probably regulated in response to external conditions, e.g. UV irradiation, which might have contributed to the successful spread of P. rhoeas throughout the world. In P. nudicaule, pigments from three compound classes, the flavonoids, nudicaulins, and carotenoids, were identified in different flower sections and developmental stages of one yellow, orange, white, and red cultivar. Additionally, the floral scent differed between cultivars, with indole emitted in high amounts only by the yellow flowers. Western honeybees, the main pollinators, were able to distinguish cultivars based on colour and/or scent. For the unique yellow, flavoalkaloidal nudicaulin pigments, both enzymatic steps as well as the final, spontaneous step of the biosynthesis were unravelled by a combined transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and chemistry approach. The provision of free indole by an indole-3-glycerol-phosphate lyase-like enzyme in the petals and the establishment of certain reaction conditions are of high importance for the biosynthetic process. The results enabled the synthesis of the first non-glycosylated nudicaulin derivatives, which showed antiproliferative and cell toxic properties and thus potential for pharmaceutical applications.",gnd:4331338-3 gnd:4154585-0 gnd:4016465-2 gnd:4694615-9
Immune evasion proteins from Staphylococcus aureus and therapeutic evaluation of staphylococcal complement-controlling proteins,"Complement as a central element of human host innate immunity provides defense against infectious microbes. However, the human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus expresses multiple complement inhibitors including the extracellular fibrinogen-binding protein (Efb). Its complement inhibitory mechanism at the molecular level, however, is still poorly understood. Complement also can be very harmful to the human host when inadequately regulated as demonstrated by the occurrence of complement-mediated diseases. A need for complement control is therefore necessary and in this context, staphylococcal complement inhibitors have a high anti-inflammatory potential. It was therefore the goal of this study to describe the complement inhibitory mechanism of Efb and to examine the protective potential of it in complement-mediated cell damage. Efb acquires the central complement proteins Factor H and C3 to form a tripartite complex. Within the complex, Efb induces a conformational change of C3 which makes it highly susceptible for cleavage by the human serine protease Factor I, making C3 incapable of participating in the complement activation.",gnd:4182912-8 gnd:1032386185 gnd:4120589-3

"An ecohydrological impact assessment in urban areas : urban water erosion in Windhoek, Namibia","Over the last decades, the world’s population has been growing at a faster rate, resulting in increased urbanisation, especially in developing countries. More than half of the global population currently lives in urbanised areas with an increasing tendency. The growth of cities results in a significant loss of vegetation cover, soil compaction and sealing of the soil surface which in turn results in high surface runoff during high-intensity storms and causes the problem of accelerated soil water erosion on streets and building grounds. Accelerated soil water erosion is a serious environmental problem in cities as it gives rise to the contamination of aquatic bodies, reduction of ground water recharge and increase in land degradation, and also results in damages to urban infrastructures, including drainage systems, houses and roads. Understanding the problem of water erosion in urban settings is essential for the sustainable planning and management of cities prone to water erosion.

"Magnetotelluric measurements across the southern Barberton Greenstone Belt, South Africa","The Barberton Greenstone Belt (BGB) in the northwestern part of South Africa belongs to the few well-preserved remnants of Archean crust. Over the last centuries, the BGB has been intensively studied at surface with detailed mapping of its surfacial geological units and tectonic features. Nevertheless, the deeper structure of the BGB remains poorly understood. Various tectonic evolution models have been developed based on geo-chronological and structural data. These theories are highly controversial and centre on the question whether plate tectonics - as geoscientists understand them today - was already evolving on the Early Earth or whether vertical mass movements driven by the higher temperature of the Earth in Archean times governed continent development. To get a step closer to answering the questions regarding the internal structure and formation of the BGB, magnetotelluric (MT) field experiments were conducted as part of the German-South African research initiative Inkaba yeAfrica. Five-component MT data (three magnetic and two electric channels) were collected at ~200 sites aligned along six profiles crossing the southern part of the BGB. Tectonic features like (fossil) faults and shear zones are often mineralized and therefore can have high electrical conductivities. Hence, by obtaining an image of the conductivity distribution of the subsurface from MT measurements can provide useful information on tectonic processes. Unfortunately, the BGB MT data set is heavily affected by man-made electromagnetic noise caused, e.g. by powerlines and electric fences. Aperiodic spikes in the magnetic and corresponding offsets in the electric field components impair the data quality particularly at periods >1 s which are required to image deep electrical structures. Application of common methods for noise reduction like delay filtering and remote reference processing, only worked well for periods <1 s. Within the framework of this thesis two new filtering approaches were developed to handle the severe noise in long period data and obtain reliable processing results. The first algorithm is based on the Wiener filter in combination with a spike detection algorithm. Comparison of data variances of a local site with those of a reference site allows the identification of disturbed time series windows for each recorded channel at the local site. Using the data of the reference site, a Wiener filter algorithm is applied to predict physically meaningful data to replace the disturbed windows. While spikes in the magnetic channels are easily recognized and replaced, steps in the electric channels are more difficult to detect depending on their offset. Therefore, I have implemented a novel approach based on time series differentiation, noise removal and subsequent integration to overcome this obstacle. A second filtering approach where spikes and steps in the time series are identified using a comparison of the short and long time average of the data was also implemented as part of my thesis. For this filtering approach the noise in the form of spikes and offsets in the data is treated by an interpolation of the affected data samples. The new developments resulted in a substantial data improvement and allowed to gain one to two decades of data (up to 10 or 100 s). The re-processed MT data were used to image the electrical conductivity distribution of the BGB by 2D and 3D inversion. Inversion models are in good agreement with the surface geology delineating the highly resistive rocks of the BGB from surrounding more conductive geological units. Fault zones appear as conductive structures and can be traced to depths of 5 to 10 km. 2D models suggest a continuation of the faults further south across the boundary of the BGB. Based on the shallow tectonic structures (fault system) within the BGB compared to deeply rooted resistive batholiths in the area, tectonic models including both vertical mass transport and in parts present-day style plate tectonics seem to be most likely for the evolution of the BGB.",gnd:4278975-8 gnd:4168603-2
Fiber-based light sources for coherent raman scattering and multi-photon imaging,"The progress in medicine, sanitation and overall prosperity has led to an increasing life-expectancy in developed countries. Consequently, degenerative and lifestyle-induced diseases, such as cardiovascular ones, Alzheimer's and certain types of cancer are the major cause of death in these countries today. As a result, the focus of bio-medical research has shifted towards early detection and treatment methods to mitigate the etiopathology of these degenerative diseases. However, their early diagnosis requires the detection of molecular perturbations on a microscopic scale, e.g. DNA mutations in the case of cancer. As a result, new imaging methods for a routine use in a medical environment are required. Imaging methods based on coherent Raman scattering are, nowadays, among the most potent techniques for a rapid visualization of the chemical composition of complex structures with sub-micrometer resolution. In particular, these methods are called Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering, stimulated Raman scattering and the Raman induced Kerr effect. All of these techniques have attracted great interest in the life and material science communities, since they are able to detect different molecules by their specific vibrational spectra. This potentially leads to label-free detection and fluorescence-free marking via small reporter molecules, e.g. alkyne tags or deuterated drugs. This intriguing feature, which has been known since the dusk of the last millennium, could not find routine usage outside specialized laser laboratories staffed with experienced laser scientists, because laser sources for CRS imaging are, even today, driven by large and complex laser setups. Due to the unreliability and massive scale of such laser systems, there have been numerous attempts to create laser concepts, which are not only powerful enough, but also robust, compact and easy enough to use to bring these promising imaging technologies to real-world clinical environments.",gnd:4131057-3 gnd:4006617-4 gnd:4337333-1 gnd:4130722-7 gnd:4176912-0 gnd:4647152-2

Inorganic Nanoarchitectures by Organic Self-Assembly,"Macromolecular self-assembly - driven by weak, non-covalent, intermolecular forces - is a common principle of structure formation in natural and synthetic organic materials. The variability in material arrangement on the nanometre length scale makes this an ideal way of matching  the structure-function demands of photonic and optoelectronic devices. However, suitable soft matter systems typically lack the appropriate photoactivity, conductivity or chemically stability. This thesis explores the implementation of soft matter design principles for inorganic thin film nanoarchitectures. Sacrificial block copolymers and colloids are employed as structure-directing agents for the co-assembly of solution-based inorganic materials, such as TiO_2 and SiO_2.

Mesenchymal stromal cell therapy for dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa,"['Zusammenfassung: Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB) is a rare heritable skin fragility disorder caused by mutations in the COL7A1 gene, coding for the anchoring fibril protein collagen VII. Under physiological conditions the unique function of collagen VII is the mediation of skin stability by attaching the epidermis to the underlying papillary dermis. Reduced amounts or the complete absence of collagen VII in patients with DEB result in severe cutaneous and extra-cutaneous disease manifestations including life-long mechanosensitivity of skin and mucosal surfaces, emergence of large body surface erosions, chronic wounds, secondary fibrosis and development of aggressive squamous cell carcinoma. The consequences of severe DEB massively impede the quality of life from the earliest years on and are hard to bear for the patient and the familiy. Despite tremendous efforts by the scientific community and pharmaceutical companies, no curative therapy is yet available for the treatment of DEB. This study describes the first long-term follow up of locally injected human mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) as a therapy option for DEB. Human bone marrow derived MSCs secreted stable triple helical collagen VII in vitro in a comparable amount to human fibroblasts and independent of individual donor age, gender or passage number. Repeated intradermal injections of MSCs in a DEB mouse model resulted in production and deposition of collagen VII at the dermal-epidermal junction, the physiological site of function. The effect was dose dependent with MSCs being up to ten-fold more potent than dermal fibroblasts. MSCs promoted regeneration of DEB wounds via normalization of dermal and epidermal healing and improved skin integrity through de novo formation of anchoring fibril-like structures. Additional benefits were gained by MSCs’ anti-inflammatory effects, which led to decreased immune cell infiltration into injured DEB skin. In this setting the clinical benefit of MSC injections lasted for more than three months.The data from this study suggest that locally applied MSCs are a viable option for DEB therapy, as they provide sufficient amounts of functional therapeutic collagen VII for the disease-challenged skin and relieve specific DEB symptoms', 'Zusammenfassung: Dystrophe epidermolysis bullosa (DEB) ist eine seltene erbliche Hauterkrankung, die durch Mutationen im COL7A1 Gen verursacht wird, welches für das Ankerfibrillenprotein Kollagen VII kodiert.

Mechanistic analysis of nonribosomal peptide synthetases,"Considering the ongoing rise of the multidrug-resistant bacterial infections, it is essential to expand the available repertoire of therapeutic agents. Microbial natural products are an indispensable source of novel activities and continue to serve as our main provider of antibiotics and chemotherapeutics.

Their importance is best illustrated by their complexity and the amounts of resources dedicated to building the underlying biosynthetic machineries nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS). These gigantic, multidomain enzymes synthesize peptides by linking individual amino acid units in an assembly line fashion. Six decades of NRPS research have resulted in several remarkable tailoring successes.

Time-resolved investigations on ultrafast shape modification dynamics of silver nanoparticles embedded in glass,"['silver nanoparticles, glass, surface plasmon resonance, ultrafast dynamics, electron emission, ionization, two temperature model.', 'Das Ziel dieser Arbeit ist es, die laserinduzierte dauerhafte Form-Modifizierungsdynamik von glaseingebettetem Silber Nanopartikeln zu untersuchen. In diesem Zusammenhang wird eine Impuls-Paar Bestrahlungstechnik vorgeschlagen, in denen sphärische Silber Nanopartikeln von zeitverzögerten fs-Laserimpuls Paaren bestrahlt werden. Diese Methode führt zur verzögerungsabhängigen Nanopartikel-Formveränderungen; deshalb können die anhaltenden Veränderungen der Oberflächenplasmonenbanden als eine Funktion der Zeitverzögerung und die relative Polarisierung der Impuls-Paare analysiert werden. Die zeitliche Evolution der Oberflächenplasmonenbanden wird bis zu einer Verzögerung von 1 ns erhalten.

A low-noise front-end for an X-band particle deflector at DESY,"['In this thesis, a low-level RF (LLRF) system for the novel polarizable transverse deflecting structure PolariX TDS is developed, installed, and commissioned at the FLASHForward beamline at DESY. The PolariX TDS operates in the X-band at 12 GHz and requires an LLRF system capable of measuring and processing signals in this frequency band. Using an approach to reuse the existing S-band LLRF system that can process signals at 3 GHz, new hardware is being developed that converts RF signals between 12 GHz and 3 GHz. The underlying components of this conversion hardware are RF mixers, filters, amplifiers, and frequency multipliers. Various candidates for all these components are characterized and compared in terms of their electrical characteristics. Since the final system performance depends heavily on the phase noise, the main focus of the characterization will be on this. With the components selected, printed circuit boards are designed, simulated, produced and packaged in hermetically sealed housings before being mounted in 19"" modules. After completion, the modules are also characterized in the laboratory. As a final step, the prototype of the PolariX TDS will be installed in the FLASHForward beamline together with the developed LLRF system. After successful commissioning, first measurements will be performed in the running accelerator. To analyze the short-term behaviour, possible procedures to eliminate the long-term effects will be discussed. The actuator chain, consisting of LLRF system, klystron and its preamplifier, is measured and characterized. The results show some discrepancy between expected and measured values and an analysis of possible sources of the problem is performed. Beam-based measurements are used to analyze the relation between the RF and the beam in terms of phase and amplitude noise. These measurements show good performance of the overall system in terms of short term phase stability in general. However, small deviations from the expected behavior are seen, analyzed, and procedures to correct them are proposed. Analyses of the long-term behavior show a large difference between the RF and beam-based measurements, which causes are still subject of research. Although not as important as the phase noise, the amplitude noise is also investigated and similar to the long term behavior, the measured RF shows better performance than the beam based measurements.', 'In dieser Arbeit wird ein low-level-RF (LLRF)-System für die neuartige polarisierbare transversal ablenkende Struktur PolariX TDS entwickelt, installiert und an der FLASHForward-Beamline bei DESY in Betrieb genommen.

Mit einem Ansatz zur Wiederverwendung des bereits existierenden S-Band LLRF-Systems, das Signale bei 3 GHz verarbeiten kann, wird neue Hardware entwickelt, die HF-Signale zwischen 12 GHz und 3 GHz umwandelt. Die zugrundeliegenden Komponenten dieser Konvertierungshardware sind HF-Mischer, Filter, Verstärker und Frequenzvervielfacher. Verschiedene Kandidaten für all diese Komponenten werden charakterisiert und hinsichtlich ihrer elektrischen Eigenschaften verglichen. Da die endgültige Systemleistung stark vom Phasenrauschen abhängt, wird das Hauptaugenmerk der Charakterisierung auf dieses gelegt. Mit den ausgewählten Komponenten werden Leiterplatten entworfen, simuliert, produziert und in hermetisch dichte Gehäuse verpackt, bevor sie in 19""-Module eingebaut werden. Nach der Fertigstellung werden die Module ebenfalls im Labor charakterisiert. Als letzter Schritt wird der Prototyp der PolariX TDS zusammen mit dem entwickelten LLRF-System in der FLASHForward-Beamline installiert.

Mit Hilfe von strahlbasierten Messungen wird eine Beziehung zwischen der HF und dem Strahl hinsichtlich Phasen- und Amplitudenrauschen untersucht. Dies zeigt eine gute Leistung des Gesamtsystems hinsichtlich der kurzzeitigen Phasenstabilität im Allgemeinen.

Optical Cooling Using the Dipole Force,"This thesis unifies the dissipative dynamics of an atom, particle or structure within an optical field that is influenced by the position of the atom, particle or structure itself. This allows the identification and exploration of the fundamental mirror-mediated mechanisms of cavity-mediated cooling leading to the proposal of a range of new techniques based upon the same underlying principles. It also reveals powerful mechanisms for the enhancement of the radiation force cooling of micromechanical systems, using both active gain and the resonance of a cavity to which the cooled species are external. This work has implications for the cooling not only of weakly-scattering individual atoms, ions and molecules, but also for highly reflective optomechanical structures ranging from nanometre-scale cantilevers to the metre-sized mirrors of massive interferometers.",gnd:4297488-4 gnd:4252501-9 gnd:7738634-6
CMS Pixel Detector Upgrade and Top Quark Pole Mass Determination,"['This thesis addresses two different topics, both vital for implementing modern high-energy physics experiments: detector development and data analysis. Providing a concise introduction to both the standard model of particle physics and the basic principles of semiconductor tracking detectors, it presents the first measurement of the top quark pole mass from the differential cross-section of tt+J events in the dileptonic tt decay channel. The first part focuses on the development and characterization of silicon pixel detectors. To account for the expected increase in luminosity of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the pixel detector of the compact muon solenoid (CMS) experiment is replaced by an upgraded detector with new front-end electronics. It presents comprehensive test beam studies conducted to verify the design and quantify the performance of the new front-end in terms of tracking efficiency and spatial resolution. Furthermore, it proposes a new cluster interpol ation method, which utilizes the third central moment of the cluster charge distribution to improve the position resolution. The second part of the thesis introduces an alternative measurement of the top quark mass from the normalized differential production cross-sections of dileptonic top quark pair events with an additional jet.

Combinatorial screening of functional polymers for organic electronics via inkjet printing,"Inkjet printing represents a solution deposition technique that is characterized by its non-contact, material-efficient and reproducible processing. It is, however, a long way to gain a full understanding of the complete drying process, since the process conditions as well as the ink properties correlate in a complex relation with the final device properties. For inkjet printing, all solute parameters have a significant influence on the preparation of the printed patterns, which makes the ink development crucial. Important factors include the contact angle, ink viscosity and surface tension as well as the nozzle diameter. By using multiple print heads, a high speed production of thin films can be performed. Therefore, inkjet printing can be used as a R2R coating technique. However, for the application of inkjet printing in a commercial available device, there are many challenges to overcome, which is the reason why inkjet printing is up to now mainly used in scientific research environment. For a detailed understanding of the preparation techniques as well as to evaluate whether inkjet printing has the potential for producing efficient devices, the drying processes and resulting film morphologies need to be well understood. This thesis provides an overview of methodical investigations of ink characteristics, printing conditions and final film properties. In particular, the possibility to integrate inkjet printing into a combinatorial screening workflow evolves inkjet printing to a notable method for an efficient screening of new materials for organic electronics applications like organic photovoltaics (OPVs), organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) and organic radical batteries (ORBs).",gnd:4154356-7 gnd:4530052-5 gnd:4185528-0
"Design, Analysis, and Implementation of Symmetric-key (Authenticated) Ciphers","Modern cryptography has become an often ubiquitous but essential part of our daily lives. Protocols for secure authentication and encryption protect our communication with various digital services, from private messaging, online shopping, to bank transactions or exchanging sensitive information. Those high-level protocols can naturally be only as secure as the authentication or encryption schemes underneath. Moreover, on a more detailed level, those schemes can also at best inherit the security of their underlying primitives. While widespread standards in modern symmetric-key cryptography, such as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), have shown to resist analysis until now, closer analysis and design of related primitives can deepen our understanding. The present thesis consists of two parts that portray six contributions: The first part considers block-cipher cryptanalysis of the round-reduced AES, the AES-based tweakable block cipher Kiasu-BC, and TNT. The second part studies the design, analysis, and implementation of provably secure authenticated encryption schemes. In general, cryptanalysis aims at finding distinguishable properties in the output distribution. Block ciphers are a core primitive of symmetric-key cryptography which are useful for the construction of various higher-level schemes, ranging from authentication, encryption, authenticated encryption up to integrity protection. Therefore, their analysis is crucial to secure cryptographic schemes at their lowest level. With rare exceptions, block-cipher cryptanalysis employs a systematic strategy of investigating known attack techniques. Modern proposals are expected to be evaluated against these techniques. The considerable effort for evaluation, however, demands efforts not only from the designers but also from external sources. The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is one of the most widespread block ciphers nowadays. Therefore, it is naturally an interesting target for further analysis. Tweakable block ciphers augment the usual inputs of a secret key and a public plaintext by an additional public input called tweak. Among various proposals through the previous decade, this thesis identifies Kiasu-BC as a noteworthy attempt to construct a tweakable block cipher that is very close to the AES. Hence, its analysis intertwines closely with that of the AES and illustrates the impact of the tweak on its security best. Moreover, it revisits a generic tweakable block cipher Tweak-and-Tweak (TNT) and its instantiation based on the round-reduced AES. The first part investigates the security of the AES against several forms of differential cryptanalysis, developing distinguishers on four to six (out of ten) rounds of AES. For Kiasu-BC, it exploits the additional freedom in the tweak to develop two forms of differential-based attacks: rectangles and impossible differentials. The results on Kiasu-BC consider an additional round compared to attacks on the (untweaked) AES. The authors of TNT had provided an initial security analysis that still left a gap between provable guarantees and attacks. Our analysis conducts a considerable step towards closing this gap. For TNT-AES - an instantiation of TNT built upon the AES round function - this thesis further shows how to transform our distinguisher into a key-recovery attack. Many applications require the simultaneous authentication and encryption of transmitted data. Authenticated encryption (AE) schemes provide both properties. Modern AE schemes usually demand a unique public input called nonce that must not repeat. Though, this requirement cannot always be guaranteed in practice. As part of a remedy, misuse-resistant and robust AE tries to reduce the impact of occasional misuses. However, robust AE considers not only the potential reuse of nonces. Common authenticated encryption also demanded that the entire ciphertext would have to be buffered until the authentication tag has been successfully verified. In practice, this approach is difficult to ensure since the setting may lack the resources for buffering the messages. Moreover, robustness guarantees in the case of misuse are valuable features. The second part of this thesis proposes three authenticated encryption schemes: RIV, SIV-x, and DCT. RIV is robust against nonce misuse and the release of unverified plaintexts. Both SIV-x and DCT provide high security independent from nonce repetitions. As the core under SIV-x, this thesis revisits the proof of a highly secure parallel MAC, PMAC-x, revises its details, and proposes SIV-x as a highly secure authenticated encryption scheme. Finally, DCT is a generic approach to have n-bit secure deterministic AE but without the need of expanding the ciphertext-tag string by more than n bits more than the plaintext. From its first part, this thesis aims to extend the understanding of the (1) cryptanalysis of round-reduced AES, as well as the understanding of (2) AES-like tweakable block ciphers. From its second part, it demonstrates how to simply extend known approaches for (3) robust nonce-based as well as (4) highly secure deterministic authenticated encryption.",gnd:4033329-2

A fundamental outcome is a detailed theoretical derivation of an effective thermodynamic potential, along with the study of anomalous vibrational properties of sphere systems.

Cylindrical Liner Z-pinches as Drivers for Converging Strong Shock Experiments,"The thesis describes the development of an entirely new experimental platform for generating and studying converging radiative shock waves.

A comprehensive set of instrumentation was devised to explore this system in detail and an exceptionally thorough experimental and theoretical study was carried out in order to understand the source of the shock waves and their dynamics.The research is directed towards some of the most interesting topics in high energy density physics (HEDP) today, namely the interaction of HED material with radiation and magnetic fields, with broad applications to inertial confinement fusion (ICF) and laboratory plasma astrophysics.

Supervised Machine Learning Methods for Item Recommendation,"['Recommender systems are personalized information systems that learn individual preferences from interacting with users. Recommender systems use machine learning techniques to compute suggestions for the users. Supervised machine learning relies on optimizing for a suitable objective function. Suitability means here that the function actually reflects what users and operators consider to be a good system performance. Most of the academic literature on recommendation is about rating prediction. For two reasons, this is not the most practically relevant prediction task in the area of recommender systems: First, the important question is not how much a user will express to like a given item (by the rating), but rather which items a user will like. Second, obtaining explicit preference information like ratings requires additional actions from the side of the user, which always comes at a cost. Implicit feedback in the form of purchases, viewing times, clicks, etc., on the other hand, is abundant anyway. Very often, this implicit feedback is only present in the form of positive expressions of preference. In this work, we primarily consider item recommendation from positive-only feedback. A particular problem is the suggestion of new items -- items that have no interaction data associated with them yet. This is an example of a cold-start scenario in recommender systems. Collaborative models like matrix factorization rely on interaction data to make predictions. We augment a matrix factorization model for item recommendation with a mechanism to estimate the latent factors of new items from their attributes (e.g. descriptive keywords). In particular, we demonstrate that optimizing the latent factor estimation with regard to the overall loss of the item recommendation task is superior to optimizing it with regard to the prediction error on the latent factors. The idea of estimating latent factors from attributes can be extended to other tasks (new users, rating prediction) and prediction models, yielding a general framework to deal with cold-start scenarios. We also adapt the Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) framework, which is state of the art in item recommendation, to a setting where more popular items are more frequently encountered when making predictions. By generalizing even more, we get Weighted Bayesian Personalized Ranking, an extension of BPR that allows importance weights to be placed on specific users and items. All method contributions are supported by experiments using large-scale real-life datasets from various application areas like movie recommendation and music recommendation. The software used for the experiments has been released as part of an efficient and scalable free software package.', 'Empfehlungssysteme sind personalisierte Informationssysteme die individuelle Vorlieben anhand von Interaktionen mit dem Benutzer lernen. Ein Großteil der Literatur zu Empfehlungssystemen bezieht sich auf die Vorhersage von Bewertungen. Dies ist nicht das in der Praxis relevanteste Vorhersageproblem: Die entscheidende Frage ist nicht, wie sehr ein Benutzer ein gegebenes Item bewerten wird, sondern welche Items ein Benutzer mag. Des weiteren ist es nicht einfach, Benutzer zu zusätzlichen Handlungen -- wie etwa Bewertungen -- zu bewegen. Implizites Feedback in der Form von Kaufhandlungen, Betrachtungszeiten, Klicks, etc. hingegen ist oft in großen Mengen vorhanden. In der vorliegenden Dissertation betrachten wir primär Item-Empfehlungen auf der Basis von positivem impliziten Feedback. Ein konkretes Problem ist das Vorschlagen neuer Items -- Items die bisher nicht an Interaktionen beteiligt waren. Wir erweitern ein Matrixfaktorisierungs-Modell für Item-Empfehlung mit einem Mechanismus, der die latenten Faktoren neuer Items auf Basis ihrer Attribute schätzt. Insbesondere zeigen wir, dass eine Optimierung des Schätzers auf die globale Verlustfunktion wesentlich besser funktioniert als eine Optimierung auf den Vorhersagefehler auf den latenten Faktoren. Das Prinzip der Faktorenschätzung auf Basis von Attributen kann auf weitere Probleme (neue Benutzer, Vorhersage von Bewertungen) ausgeweitet werden, was uns ein generisches Werkzeug zur Lösung von Kaltstart-Szenarien in Empfehlungssystemen an die Hand gibt. Des weiteren modifizieren wir die Methode des Bayesschen Personalisierten Rankings (BPR) für ein Szenario in dem beliebte Items zur Vorhersagezeit häufiger vorkommen.

High-contrast laser-driven monoenergetic proton beams and near-critical density plasma diagnosis,"In this dissertation, the experiments are conducted at the Jenaer Titanium: Sapphire 200 Terawatt Laser System (JETi200) located in Jena, Germany. With its excellent temporal contrast, the few-nanometer freestanding target can remain in a solid state for a few picoseconds before the main pulse arrives, greatly reducing the pre-expansion of the target. The resulting proton beams exhibit distinctive features in terms of cut-off energy and energy spectrum distribution. The proton beams in the presented experiment show a more than 30 MeV monoenergetic peak under the circularly polarized laser, and the highest peak particle kinetic energy per Joule of laser energy is around 20MeV/J. As opposed to the circularly polarized driving light, the cut-off energy shows weak dependence on the target thickness when irradiated with linearly polarized light. Moreover, the implementation of a transmission light diagnostic in the experiment indicates that the transmission light of the main pulse is significantly weaker than that in other similar experiments. The energy and energy spectrum of the protons provide the potential to conduct in vivo research and proton skin therapy using the Terawatt-level laser system. Laser contrast significantly impacts laser-driven ion acceleration, as low contrast can lead to premature expansion of thin targets. The evolution of premature expansion, caused by pre-pulses, is primarily based on numerical calculations research. However, in this paper, I conduct a comprehensive experimental study of pre-pulse-induced pre-plasma evolution, including the measurement of pre-plasma evolution time and comparison with a previous numerical model. This investigation is especially beneficial for the latest generation of laser ion accelerators, as it enables the precise quantification of temporal contrast requirements in the Petawatt laser driver era.",gnd:4034610-9 gnd:4176022-0 gnd:4137643-2 gnd:4046249-3

Computational methods for small molecule identification,"Identification of small molecules remains a central question in analytical chemistry, in particular for natural product research, metabolomics, environmental research, and biomarker discovery. Mass spectrometry is the predominant technique for high-throughput analysis of small molecules. But it reveals only information about the mass of molecules and, by using tandem mass spectrometry, about the mass of molecular fragments. Automated interpretation of mass spectra is often limited to searching in spectral libraries, such that we can only dereplicate molecules for which we have already recorded reference mass spectra. In this thesis we present methods for answering two central questions: What is the molecular formula of the measured ion and what is its molecular structure? SIRIUS is a combinatorial optimization method for annotating a spectrum and identifying the ion's molecular formula by computing hypothetical fragmentation trees. We present a new scoring for computing fragmentation trees, transforming the combinatorial optimization into a maximum a posteriori estimator. This allows us to learn parameters and hyperparameters of the scoring directly from data. We demonstrate that the statistical model, which was fitted on a small dataset, generalises well across many different datasets and mass spectrometry instruments. In addition to tandem mass spectra, isotope pattern can be used for identifying the molecular formula of the precursor ion. We present a novel scoring for comparing isotope patterns based on maximum likelihood. We describe how to integrate the isotope pattern analysis into the fragmentation tree optimisation problem to analyse  data were fragment peaks and isotope peaks occur within the same spectrum. We demonstrate that the new scorings significantly improves on the task of molecular formula assignment. We evaluate SIRIUS on several datasets and show that it outperforms all other methods for molecular formula annotation by a large margin. We also present CSI:FingerID, a method for predicting a molecular fingerprint from a tandem mass spectrum using kernel support vector machines. The predicted fingerprint can be searched in a structure database to identify the molecular structure. CSI:FingerID is based on FingerID, that uses probability product kernels on mass spectra for this task. We describe several novel kernels for comparing fragmentation trees instead of spectra. These kernels are combined using multiple kernel learning. We present a new scoring based on posterior probabilities and extend the method to use additional molecular fingerprints. We demonstrate on several datasets that CSI:FingerID identifies more molecules than its predecessor FingerID and outperforms all other methods for this task. We analyse how each of the methodological improvements of CSI:FingerID contributes to its identification performance and make suggestions for future improvements of the method. Both methods, SIRIUS and CSI:FingerID, are available as commandline tool and as user interface.

"Democracy, markets and the commons : towards a reconciliation of freedom and ecology","How can we overcome the existing political, economic, and ecological crises that humanity faces? With the notion of the commons, Lukas Peter argues that this form of social organization can provide answers to the shortcomings of centralized states and open and competitive markets. By building on and going beyond the work of Elinor and Vincent Ostrom, he develops an ecological understanding of the commons and human freedom, more generally, thereby reinterpreting classical thinkers such as John Locke and John Rawls. Importantly, he does not suggest an end to property, states or markets, but rather a radical democratization thereof, ultimately providing a real alternative for the 21st century",gnd:4026152-9 gnd:4037653-9 gnd:4156531-9 gnd:4043179-4 gnd:4011413-2 gnd:4141970-4 gnd:4078523-3 gnd:4066493-4

Aggregation- and photophysics of merocyanine dyes for photovoltaic application,"The supramolecular structure essentially determines properties and function of organic solar cells and other organic optoelectronic devices. Aggregation in organic bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells is usually beneficial and a lack of aggregation is one of the main factors limiting the efficiency. To enhance the knowledge about aggregation of dyes and their effect on electro optical parameters, it is very useful to have a model system of similar molecules, which can be forced into different intermolecular arrangements in thin films. With these model systems, it is possible to investigate the influence of different aggregate structures on the optical absorption, emission and recombination kinetics. Another point that turned out to be crucial is that especially dipolar molecules tend to build dimers, micelles etc. in solution. Furthermore, it turned out that the dimerization can be enhanced by the illumination with light. Finally, in the thesis at hand I could highlight the impact of supramolecular structure on absorption and emission spectra as well as on the excited state kinetics. For this research we have focused on merocyanine dyes, which were well investigated in solution, but lacking a comprehensive understanding on how to broadly tuning the supramolecular structure and their influence on optical and electronical properties as well as excited state dynamics. I succeeded to systematically tune the supramolecular structure towards H-aggregates by means of depositing Langmuir layers at increasing surface pressures. The accompanied increase in supramolecular order leads to creation of efficient dark deactivation channels, what explains the lower power conversion efficiency by dye aggregation in a DSSC device.",gnd:4181740-0 gnd:4000728-5

In order to better predict seismic ground motions, I propose two approaches based on unsupervised deep learning methods, an autoencoder network and Generative Adversarial Networks. The autoencoder technique explores a massive amount of ground motion data, evaluates the required parameters, and generates synthetic ground motion data in the Fourier amplitude spectra (FAS) domain. This method is tested on two synthetic datasets and one real dataset. [...]",gnd:1135597375 gnd:4379341-1 gnd:4802620-7

"Diversity, evolutionary history and functional characterization of plant cell wall degrading enzymes in beetles of the family Cerambycidae","The Cerambycidae, also known as longhorned beetles, are a family of plant-feeding beetles (Phytophaga) that specifically feed on wood (xylophagy). Woody tissues lack essential nutrients for insect development, and long-chain polysaccharides of wood structures make it difficult for beetles to degrade the plant cell wall within their digestive systems. However, Cerambycidae have evolved in this challenging environment by successfully breaking down polysaccharides and acquiring nutrients from woody tissues. Previous studies identified that cerambycid beetles possess endogenous plant cell wall degrading enzymes (PCWDEs). However, within the Cerambycidae family, consisting of eight subfamilies, research on PCWDEs has focused on only one subfamily (Lamiinae), leaving very little known about PCWDEs in other subfamilies. My project provides the first comprehensive study of genomic data from the family Cerambycidae, using 23 species of beetles representing six subfamilies. I have shown that most cerambycid beetles are not fully dependent on microorganisms or symbionts to digest plant matter but possess their digestive enzymes. Enzyme-encoding genes have been horizontally acquired from various microbial donors and have evolved by gene duplications after these HGT events. These findings are an excellent starting point for studying the complementary function and evolution of endogenous PCWDEs in cerambycid and other phytophagous beetles.",gnd:4426259-0 gnd:4062676-3 gnd:4146114-9 gnd:4190675-5 gnd:4071050-6
Towards automated advanced vulnerability analysis,"The identification of vulnerabilities in IT infrastructures is a crucial problem in enhancing the security, because many incidents resulted from already known vulnerabilities, which could have been resolved. Thus, the initial identification of vulnerabilities has to be used to directly resolve the related weaknesses and mitigate attack possibilities. The nature of vulnerability information requires a collection and normalization of the information prior to any utilization, because the information is widely distributed in different sources with their unique formats. Therefore, the comprehensive vulnerability model was defined and different sources have been integrated into one database. Furthermore, different analytic approaches have been designed and implemented into the HPI-VDB, which directly benefit from the comprehensive vulnerability model and especially from the logical preconditions and postconditions. Firstly, different approaches to detect vulnerabilities in both IT systems of average users and corporate networks of large companies are presented.

Theory and application of induced higher order color aberrations,"Induced aberrations in general are higher-order aberrations caused by ray perturbations of lower order, picked up surface by surface in the preceding optical system. Therefore, induced aberration coefficients are depending on the cumulative preexisting aberrations in the system. In case of color aberrations, induced influences are already observable in the paraxial regime, since even paraxial rays are affected by dispersion. Hence, in every optical system small perturbations in ray heights and ray angles for paraxial rays of different wavelengths are present. These ray perturbations generate induced color aberration effects of higher-order. Here, different orders refer to the paraxial ray dependency on dispersion. The linear or 1st-order terms result in the well-known Seidel contributions of axial and lateral color, where any interaction of dispersion between different lenses is neglected. Starting at 2nd-order terms, induced color effects are present. In this thesis, an introduction on the basic idea of induced color aberrations is given, followed by a surface resolved analytical description for 2nd-order axial and lateral color as well as for the chromatic variations of the five Seidel aberrations. A differentiation between induced and intrinsic parts is derived and discussed. Illustrated by descriptive academic systems as well as by a complex microscopic design example, the importance and the influences of induced color aberrations for optical systems is demonstrated.",gnd:4132894-2
"Plant-habitat interactions in brackish marshes : coping with, adapting to and modifying the environment","Estuarine marshes are ecosystems that are situated at the transition zone between land and water and are thus controlled by physical and biological interactions. Marsh vegetation offers important ecosystem services by filtrating solid and dissolved substances from the water  and providing habitat. By buffering a large part of the arriving flow velocity, attenuating wave energy and serving as erosion control for riverbanks, tidal marshes furthermore reduce the destructive effects of storm surges and storm waves and thus contribute to ecosystem-based shore protection. However, in many estuaries, extensive embankments, artificial bank protection, river dredging and agriculture threaten tidal marshes. Global warming might entail additional risks, such as changes in water levels, an increase of the tidal amplitude and a resulting shift of the salinity zones.

Charge Dynamics in 122 Iron-Based Superconductors,"This thesis combines highly accurate optical spectroscopy data on the recently discovered iron-based high-temperature superconductors with an incisive theoretical analysis. Three outstanding results are reported: (1) The superconductivity-induced modification of the far-infrared conductivity of an iron arsenide with minimal chemical disorder is quantitatively described by means of a strong-coupling theory for spin fluctuation mediated Cooper pairing. The formalism developed in this thesis also describes prior spectroscopic data on more disordered compounds. (2) The same materials exhibit a sharp superconductivity-induced anomaly for photon energies around 2.5 eV, two orders of magnitude larger than the superconducting energy gap. The author provides a qualitative interpretation of this unprecedented observation, which is based on the multiband nature of the superconducting state. (3) The thesis also develops a comprehensive description of a superconducting, yet optically transparent iron chalcogenide compound. The author shows that this highly unusual behavior can be explained as a result of the nanoscopic coexistence of insulating and superconducting phases, and he uses a combination of two complementary experimental methods - scanning near-field optical microscopy and low-energy muon spin rotation - to directly image the phase coexistence and quantitatively determine the phase composition.

Convection at atmospheric conditions -- Chapter 4. Convection under pure vapor -- Chapter 5. Convection at reduced pressures -- Chapter 6. Linear stability analysis -- Chapter 7. Conclusions and recommendations.', 'This thesis represents the first systematic description of the two-phase flow problem. Two-phase flows of volatile fluids in confined geometries driven by an applied temperature gradient play an important role in a range of applications, including thermal management, such as heat pipes, thermosyphons, capillary pumped loops and other evaporative cooling devices. Previously, this problem has been addressed using a piecemeal approach that relied heavily on correlations and unproven assumptions, and the science and technology behind heat pipes have barely evolved in recent decades. The model introduced in this thesis, however, presents a comprehensive physically based description of both the liquid and the gas phase. The model has been implemented numerically and successfully validated against the available experimental data, and the numerical results are used to determine the key physical processes that control the heat and mass flow and describe the flow stability. One of the key contributions of this thesis work is the description of the role of noncondensables, such as air, on transport. In particular, it is shown that many of the assumptions used by current engineering models of evaporative cooling devices are based on experiments conducted at atmospheric pressures, and these assumptions break down partially or completely when most of the noncondensables are removed, requiring a new modeling approach presented in the thesis. Moreover, Numerical solutions are used to motivate and justify a simplified analytical description of transport in both the liquid and the gas layer, which can be used to describe flow stability and determine the critical Marangoni number and wavelength describing the onset of the convective pattern. As a result, the results presented in the thesis should be of interest both to engineers working in heat transfer and researchers interested in fluid dynamics and pattern formation.']",gnd:4132435-3 gnd:4077970-1 gnd:4219221-3 gnd:4137276-1 gnd:4148259-1 gnd:4254978-4 gnd:4156024-3 gnd:4328925-3

Measurement of atmospheric carbon dioxide abundance on board unmanned aircraft – challenges and applications,"In this dissertation the COmpact Carbon dioxide analyser for Airborne Platforms (COCAP) is presented. COCAP measures the abundance of carbon dioxide (CO2) in ambient air as well as air temperature, humidity and pressure, and is specifically designed for the use on board small unmanned aircraft systems (UASs). Accurate CO2 measurements are ensured by extensive calibration in an environmental chamber, by regular calibration in the field and by chemical drying of sampled air. In addition, the analyser is equipped with a custom-built, lightweight thermal stabilisation system that reduces the influence of ambient temperature changes on the CO2 sensor by two orders of magnitude. The robustness of COCAP under varying environmental conditions has been verified through a series of tests both in the lab and in the field. As a first application of the newly developed instrument, COCAP was used to constrain the nocturnal carbon dioxide emission of an ecosystem based on the nocturnal boundary layer (NBL) budget method. The NBL budgets were calculated from a series of CO2 profiles measured by COCAP on board a UAS during the course of two nights. The fluxes obtained in the pilot study are plausible and insensitive to experimental uncertainties. Given the versatility and moderate cost of UASs and their minimal infrastructure requirements, this innovative sampling technique makes the NBL budget method for the quantification of surface fluxes more accessible and cost-effective. This work demonstrates how the potential of UASs for measuring trace gases in theatmosphere can be exploited, thus opening up new possibilities for atmospheric research.",gnd:4169536-7 gnd:4332556-7 gnd:4031648-8
Deformation Tracking in Depth and Color Video : an Analysis by Synthesis Approach,"The tracking of deforming objects and the reconstruction of deformation in image sequences is one of the current research areas in computer vision. In contrast to rigid scenes, which can be analyzed and reconstructed very well, general deformations come with an infinite number of sub-movements and ways to parametrize them, which makes it very difficult to formulate discrete tracking goals. In contrast to the classic reconstructions based on color data alone, the combination of depth and color video provides tracking algorithms with a data foundation with less room for ambiguities, but also requires new algorithmic approaches to handle different entities and to exploit the available data. This thesis discusses an Analysis by Synthesis (AbS) scheme as an approach to the deformation tracking problem, a method that differs in many key aspects from common reconstruction schemes. It is demonstrated that AbS based deformation reconstruction can reconstruct complex deformations, deal with occlusions and self-occlusions, and can also be used for real-time tracking.",gnd:4078895-7 gnd:4311226-2
On minimal graded free resolutions,"Minimal graded free resolutions are an important and central topic in algebra. They are a useful tool for studying modules over finitely generated graded K-algebras. Such a resolution determines the Hilbert series, the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity and other invariants of the module. This thesis is concerned with the structure of minimal graded free resolutions. We relate our results to several recent trends in commutative algebra. The first of these trends deals with relations between properties of the Stanley-Reisner ring associated to a simplicial complex and the  Stanley-Reisner ring of its Alexander dual. Another development is the investigation of the linear part of a minimal graded free resolution as defined by Eisenbud and Schreyer. Several authors were interested in the problem to give lower bounds for the Betti numbers of a module. In particular, Eisenbud-Koh, Green, Herzog and Reiner-Welker studied the graded Betti numbers which determine the linear strand of a minimal graded free resolution. Bigraded algebras occur naturally in many research areas of commutative algebra. A typical example of a bigraded algebra is the Rees ring of a graded ideal. Herzog and Trung used this bigraded structure of the Rees ring to study the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of powers of graded ideals in a polynomial ring. Conca, Herzog, Trung and Valla dealt with diagonal subalgebras of bigraded algebras.

Assessing natural risks for railway infrastructure and transportation in Austria,"Natural hazards can have serious societal and economic impacts.

In this thesis, dye-sensitized NiO photocathodes were constructed with a series of newly synthesized covalent dye-catalyst assemblies featuring an organic dye and a cobalt catalyst and a comprehensive characterization was carried out in order to be able to rationally improve upon the systems for the next generation of dye-catalyst assemblies. To this end, their activity was assessed in photoelectrochemical proton reduction and a 40-fold increase in hydrogen production was observed after 22h compared to the previous generation of dyads. Operando and post-operando measurements yielded information about the degradation mechanism and kinetics during operation. The instability of the cyanoacrylate acceptor group on the dye in its reduced state was revealed which led to a loss of activity over time. Furthermore, the light-induced processes in the assemblies were studied in solution and on NiO using time-resolved spectroscopy, especially the electron transfer from the dye to the catalyst unit. A novelty of this work was to carry out these measurements while applying a potential, allowing the study under quasi-operando conditions. To this end, a spectroelectrochemical cell was developed for transient absorption spectroelectrochemical experiments on sensitized films. Using this technique, the electron transfer on the best-performing system could be observed when immobilized on NiO, while in solution electron transfer was absent. This could be correlated to the rather slow (ns-µs scale) kinetics of the electron transfer which cannot compete with the fast deactivation of the dye excited state in solution (<2 ns).",gnd:4174489-5 gnd:4740992-7

It is the first time that the number of jets is not explicitly restricted to one or two, thus increasing the sensitivity to new signals. Instead, a balance between the most energetic jet and the missing transverse momentum is required, thus selecting mono-jet-like final states. Collider searches for Dark Matter have typically used signal models employing effective field theories (EFTs), even when comparing to results from direct and indirect detection experiments, where the difference in energy scale renders many such comparisons invalid. The thesis features the first robust and comprehensive treatment of the validity of EFTs in collider searches, and provides a means by which the different classifications of Dark Matter experiments can be compared on a sound and fair basis.']",gnd:4230260-2 gnd:4398783-7 gnd:4375595-1 gnd:4360012-8 gnd:4246572-2
"Teaching evolution as an interdisciplinary science : concepts, theory, and network infrastructure for educational design research","Evolution is an interdisciplinary science. Evolutionary theory is routinely employed across the overlapping domains of the natural, social, and computational sciences, as a high level generalization of processes of change within complex adaptive systems. Despite this interdisciplinary character of evolutionary science, evolution education remains almost exclusively the purview of the biology classroom within general education curricula around the world. This thesis engages conceptual clarification and educational design research to map and explore the educational potential of teaching evolution as the interdisciplinary science that it is. Beginning with a foray into student conceptions of the capacities for and causes of cooperation in chimpanzees and human children, it is argued that research in comparative psychology provides a fertile entry point for engaging the interdisciplinarity of evolutionary sciences. A considered analysis of persistent challenges within traditional approaches to biological evolution education then outlines core conceptual issues and pedagogical strategies for an interdisciplinary approach. This conceptual work supports the exploratory development of two novel directions in evolution education. First, in human evolution, a new toolkit is presented to engage students in causal mapping of the many processes and information streams that have shaped human origins. Second, an interdisciplinary approach to community-based school improvement has been developed that empowers youth to become drivers of valued change within their school community, while challenging them to reflect on the evolutionary theoretical context for such cultural change. Future directions in research are discussed within the context of the OpenEvo learning hub, an online educational innovation and design research lab to drive continued development in this space.",gnd:4071050-6 gnd:4006855-9
Modeling atmospheres of classical novae in X-rays with PHOENIX,"PHOENIX has been used to calculate model atmospheres of classical novae in the X-ray spectral range. The models account for an expanding, one-dimensional spherically symmetric medium in full non-local thermodynamic equilibrium. Nova atmospheres have been modeled with PHOENIX since the early 90's to fit the early nova spectra in the ultraviolet and infrared spectral ranges. In this work the PHOENIX-code has been enhanced to also model X-ray spectra. This was accomplished by accounting for atomic data and physical processes. The synthetic spectra were compared to observations from the LETGS onboard the CHANDRA X-ray satellite. The template is the observation of nova V4743 Sagittarii in March 2003. The spectrum is very spectacular because of the nova brightness and CHANDRA's spectral resolution. Further observations from July2003, September 2003, and February 2004 were taken. Models with solar and non-solar abundances have been calculated and the synthetic spectra have been fitted to the four observations. The fits were used to discuss discrepancies between models and observations. The effective temperature of the atmosphere, the hydrogen column density, and the abundances ofhelium, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and iron in the shell were determined by the fits. It was examined how the parameters evolve with time. With the models the atmosphere structure and NLTE effects were determined. The models were compared to the previous nova model atmospheres from PHOENIX ...",gnd:4172093-3
Bakterieller Abbau von refraktärem organischem Material im Weserästuar und in der Nordsee,"['The degradation of humic acids by bacterial communities originating from the Weser estuary and the German Wadden Sea was studied using flow-through cultures. Phylogenetic analysis showed that Alphaproteobacteria, in particular representatives of the Roseobacter group dominated the culture approaches with marine bacteria. The flow-through cultures with estuarine bacterial communities showed a predominance of Gammaproteobacteria and Actinobacteria. The change in salinity in the approaches, as compared to the salinity of the original habitat of the bacteria, led to an intensified decomposition of humic acids. Although only higher molecular weight humic acids were initially applied, lower molecular weight fulvic acids were additionally isolated from the culture media at the end of the experiment. The comparison of humic acids before and after incubation using pyrolysis-GC/MS showed that aliphatic compounds were decomposed primarily by bacterial communities, while only a few aromatic compounds were utilized by bacteria. <engl.>', 'Der Abbau von Huminsäuren durch Bakteriengemeinschaften aus dem Weserästuar und dem deutschen Wattenmeer wurde mittels Inkubationen in Durchflusskulturen untersucht.

Groundwater recharge in tropical wet regions via GIS-based methods and cosmic-ray neutron sensing,"Studies on the unsustainable use of groundwater resources are still considered incipient since it is frequently a poorly understood and managed, devalued and inadequately protected natural resource. Groundwater Recharge (GWR) is one of the most challenging elements to estimate since it can rarely be measured directly and cannot easily be derived from existing data. To overcome these limitations, many hydro(geo)logists have combined different approaches to estimate large-scale GWR, namely: remote sensing products, such as IMERG product; Water Budget Equation, also in combination with hydrological models, and; Geographic Information System (GIS), using estimation formulas. For intermediary-scale GWR estimation, there exist: Non-invasive Cosmic-Ray Neutron Sensing (CRNS); wireless networks from local soil probes; and soil hydrological models, such as HYDRUS. Accordingly, this PhD thesis aims, on the one hand, to demonstrate a GIS-based model coupling for estimating the GWR distribution on a large scale in tropical wet basins.

Novel methods for the analysis of small molecule fragmentation mass spectra,"The identification of small molecules, such as metabolites, in a high throughput manner plays an important in many research areas. Mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the predominant analysis technologies and is much more sensitive than nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Fragmentation of the molecules is used to obtain information beyond its mass. Gas chromatography-MS is one of the oldest and most widespread techniques for the analysis of small molecules. Commonly, the molecule is fragmented using electron ionization (EI). Using this technique, the molecular ion peak is often barely visible in the mass spectrum or even absent. We present a method to calculate fragmentation trees from high mass accuracy EI spectra, which annotate the peaks in the mass spectrum with molecular formulas of fragments and explain relevant fragmentation pathways. Fragmentation trees enable the identification of the molecular ion and its molecular formula if the molecular ion is present in the spectrum. The method works even if the molecular ion is of very low abundance. MS experts confirm that the calculated trees correspond very well to known fragmentation mechanisms.Using pairwise local alignments of fragmentation trees, structural and chemical similarities to already-known molecules can be determined. In order to compare a fragmentation tree of an unknown metabolite to a huge database of fragmentation trees, fast algorithms for solving the tree alignment problem are required. Unfortunately the alignment of unordered trees, such as fragmentation trees, is NP-hard. We present three exact algorithms for the problem. Evaluation of our methods showed that thousands of alignments can be computed in a matter of minutes. Both the computation and the comparison of fragmentation trees are rule-free approaches that require no chemical knowledge about the unknown molecule and thus will be very helpful in the automated analysis of metabolites that are not included in common libraries.",gnd:4155138-2 gnd:4037882-2 gnd:4596131-1 gnd:4138579-2

"Isogeometric and CAD-based methods for shape and topology optimization: Sensitivity analysis, Bézier elements and phase-field approaches","The Finite Element Method (FEM) is widely used in engineering for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) over complex geometries. To this end, it is required to provide the FEM software with a geometric model that is typically constructed in a Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software. However, FEM and CAD use different approaches for the mathematical description of the geometry. Thus, it is required to generate a mesh, which is suitable for FEM, based on the CAD model. Nonetheless, this procedure is not a trivial task and it can be time consuming. This issue becomes more significant for solving shape and topology optimization problems, which consist in evolving the geometry iteratively. Therefore, the computational cost associated to the mesh generation process is increased exponentially for this type of applications.  The main goal of this work is to investigate the integration of CAD and CAE in shape and topology optimization. To this end, numerical tools that close the gap between design and analysis are presented. The specific objectives of this work are listed below:  • Automatize the sensitivity analysis in an isogeometric framework for applications in shape optimization. Applications for linear elasticity are considered.  • A methodology is developed for providing a direct link between the CAD model and the analysis mesh. In consequence, the sensitivity analysis can be performed in terms of the design variables located in the design model.  • The last objective is to develop an isogeometric method for shape and topological optimization. This method should take advantage of using Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) with higher continuity as basis functions.  Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) is a framework designed to integrate the design and analysis in engineering problems. The fundamental idea of IGA is to use the same basis functions for modeling the geometry, usually NURBS, for the approximation of the solution fields. The advantage of integrating design and analysis is two-fold. First, the analysis stage is more accurate since the system of PDEs is not solved using an approximated geometry, but the exact CAD model. Moreover, providing a direct link between the design and analysis discretizations makes possible the implementation of efficient sensitivity analysis methods. Second, the computational time is significantly reduced because the mesh generation process can be avoided. ...",gnd:7662388-9 gnd:4329076-0 gnd:4017233-8 gnd:4069794-0 gnd:7718401-4
Core-shell upconversion nanoparticles - investigation of dopant intermixing and surface modification,Frequency upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) are inorganic nanocrystals capable to up-convert incident photons of the near-infrared electromagnetic spectrum (NIR) into higher energy photons. These photons are re-emitted in the range of the visible (Vis) and even ultraviolet (UV) light. The frequency upconversion process (UC) is realized with nanocrystals doped with trivalent lanthanoid ions (Ln(III)). The Ln(III) ions provide the electronic (excited) states forming a ladder-like electronic structure for the Ln(III) electrons in the nanocrystals. The absorption of at least two low energy photons by the nanoparticle and the subsequent energy transfer to one Ln(III) ion leads to the promotion of one Ln(III) electron into higher excited electronic states. One high energy photon will be emitted during the radiative relaxation of the electron in the excited state back into the electronic ground state of the Ln(III) ion. The excited state electron is the result of the previous absorption of at least two low energy photons.

The general aim is to develop a global model of the comet and its environment in order to characterize the physical conditions around comets 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and 46P/Wirtanen with respect to the heliocentric distance. The results also provide estimates of the effects of the cometary environment on the radio science investigations experiment (RSI) aboard the spacecraft Rosetta.

A heat balance equation is applied as boundary condition on the surface. Many parameters that have to be accounted for in a heat diffusion model are not precisely known to date. The variation of these parameters within reasonable limits yields a wide range of possible results.

Performance and stability of semiconductor nanowire devices,"Nanotechnology is a key element in modern technological progress offering solutions to some of the most pressing issues for society, such as in the fields of health, communication, and energy consumption. The solutions that nanotechnology provides comprise amplifiers, actuators, or sensors and emitters, etc. as building blocks operating at the nanoscale. Semiconductor nanowires are perfectly suited for the use in such applications, as they not only provide functional electronic and optical properties but also nanoscale dimensions. Their high aspect ratio furthermore makes them inherently suited to bridge scales from the nanoscale to the macroscopic scales humans interact with. Key requirements for such nanodevices-besides the high functionality-are also reliability and stability. A thorough understanding of the operation and the limitations of nanowire-based devices is therefore urgently needed. Here, the operation, stability, and degradation of optoelectronic and all-optical devices based on semiconductor nanowires are investigated. Ultra-high spatial resolution hard X-ray detection is demonstrated using a GaAs nanowire with an axial p-n junction. Advanced X-ray analytical techniques are applied to study the detector operation by monitoring internal electrical fields in-operando. Inspecting the stability, a hot electron beam-induced selective oxidization of the n-type nanowire segment is observed. Further, the operation and stability of all-optical ZnO and CdS nanowire devices are investigated. The spontaneous and stimulated emission from the nanowires is detected as a function of electron irradiation using an electron microscope. As electron beams are frequently used for nanoscale sample inspection and fabrication, an understanding is sought for electron beam-induced changes of the optical properties.",gnd:4158814-9 gnd:4707308-1
Deciphering multiple changes in complex climate time series using Bayesian inference,"Change points in time series are perceived as heterogeneities in the statistical or dynamical characteristics of the observations. Unraveling such transitions yields essential information for the understanding of the observed system’s intrinsic evolution and potential external influences. A precise detection of multiple changes is therefore of great importance for various research disciplines, such as environmental sciences, bioinformatics and economics. The primary purpose of the detection approach introduced in this thesis is the investigation of transitions underlying direct or indirect climate observations. In order to develop a diagnostic approach capable to capture such a variety of natural processes, the generic statistical features in terms of central tendency and dispersion are employed in the light of Bayesian inversion. In contrast to established Bayesian approaches to multiple changes, the generic approach proposed in this thesis is not formulated in the framework of specialized partition models of high dimensionality ...",gnd:4648118-7 gnd:4031170-3 gnd:4067486-1

Submanifolds with parallel second fundamental form studied via the Gau map,"For an arbitrary n-dimensional riemannian manifold N and an integer m between 1 and n-1 a covariant derivative on the Graßmann bundle G_m(TN) is introduced which has the property that an m-dimensional submanifold M of N has parallel second fundamental form if and only if its Gauß map (defined on M with values in G_m(TN)) is affine. (For the case that N is the euclidian space this result was already obtained by J.Vilms in 1972.) By means of this relation a generalization of E. Cartan's theorem on the total geodesy of a geodesic umbrella can be derived: Suppose, initial data (p,W,b) prescribing an m-dimensional tangent space W and a second fundamental form b at p in N are given; for these data we construct an m-dimensional ``umbrella'' M=M(p,W,b) in N, the rays of which are helical arcs of N; moreover we present tensorial conditions (not involving the covariant derivative on G_m(TN)) which guarantee that the umbrella M has parallel second fundamental form. These conditions are as well necessary, and locally every submanifold with parallel second fundamental form can be obtained in this way.",gnd:4128503-7 gnd:4156105-3
"Metabolomic analysis, isolation, characterization and synthesis of bioactive compounds from Hypericum species (Hypericaceae)","['How can we discover new bioactive compounds from complex mixtures, e.g. medicinal plant extracts, prior to any isolation? Natural products are an important source of drugs. However, their discovery is hindered by many challenges including the high rediscovery rate and time consuming work. Methods used so far fail to consider the structural novelty. This work describes comparative metabolomic approaches based on three independent analytical methods (1H NMR, 2D NMR and LC-MS) to detect, prior to any isolation, extracts containing novel compounds as revealed by multivariate data analysis and discriminatory MS/NMR signals. These new holistic methods were applied to compare 17 Hypericum species. Novel natural products from selected extracts were isolated guided by their NMR/MS signals. The investigation of 3 prioritized species resulted in the isolation and characterization of 23 new natural products.The structures of isolated compounds were established by NMR and HR-MS data supported by chemical synthesis and ECD calculations for absolute configuration determination.

Funktionalisiertes Graphen als multifunktionales Additiv und Nanofüllstoff für die Schmelzcompoundierung von Thermoplasten und thermoplastischen Elastomeren,"['Zusammenfassung: The present study addressed the production of multifunctional polymer nanocomposites of hitherto unknown material property profiles by incorporation of functionalized graphene (FGs) based on the thermal reduction of graphite oxide (TRGO). Transferring the outstanding intrinsic properties of graphene nanoplatelets on toughened, flame retardant polypropylene (PP-FR), polyamide 12 (PA 12) and polystyrene-b-poly(ethylene-co-butylene)-b-polystyrene (SEBS) aimed at a simultaneous improvement of mechanical load capacity and electrical conductivity in addition to fire behavior and gas barrier properties of thermoplastics and thermoplastic elastomers. Furthermore, the influence of TRGO upon superstructure formation and the resulting properties was examined within the fabrication of all-PE/graphene hybrid nanocomposites.The reinforcing character of TRGO was evaluated by the use of conventional and recently developed commercial carbon additives within the formation of PP-FR-, PA 12- and SEBS-nanocomposites using common melt compounding techniques. In addition to expanded graphites EG 40 and EG 60, multi-layer graphenes MLG 250 and MLG 350 served as platelet-like reference fillers, owning decreasing particle sizes and remaining stacks of graphene nanosheets. Moreover, CB and CNTs were employed as well-known comparative carbon additives of spherical and tubular nanofiller morphology and varying aspect ratios, respectively.PP-FR coating with TRGO- and carbon dispersions as well as subsequent melt extrusion and injection molding succeeded to produce electrically conductive PP-FR nanocomposites of enhanced stiffness, which likewise offered improved flame retardancy. Thereby, the incorporation of TRGO accounted for highest modulus increase (+ 80 %) and the most efficient reduction of maximum heat release rate (- 74 %) at simultaneously enhanced electrical conductivity (1E-6 S/cm), which can be attributed to excellent FG dispersibility and the distinct formation of percolating TRGO network-like structures. MLG 350 and MLG 250 induced similar effects, although not reaching the range of absolute values achieved with TRGO due to poorer MLG exfoliation and dispersion performance. In contrast, the comparison of platelet-like fillers revealed that the incorporation of EG 60 and EG 40 offered significantly lower property synergies caused by insufficient graphite separation and the resulting formation of inhomogeneous microcomposites.

Environmental organic geochemistry of sediments from Wadi Gaza and investigation of bioremediation of petroleum derivatives and herbicides by cyanobacterial mats under different experimental conditions,"['This thesis presents for the first time results of (i) an organic geochemical analysis of sediments from Wadi Gaza, and (ii) an investigation of the degradation potential of naturally occurring cyanobacterial mats originating from Wadi Gaza. In the Wadi Gaza sediments, the presence of pristane and phytane, an unresolved complex mixture (UCM), the UCM/n-alcane ratio, the low carbon preference index (CPI ca. 1), steranes and hopanes and the presence of the phenanthrene, dibenzothiophene and their alkylated homologues confirms the input of crude oil and petroleum derivatives. Wadi Gaza cyanobacterial mats degraded aromatic compounds (phenantrene and dibenzothiophene) faster than aliphatic ones (pristane and n-octadecane) in both laboratory and mesocosm experiments. An Egyptian crude oil was also degraded. More than 80% of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and 60% of terbutryn were removed within 30 and 80 days, respectively.

Laser beam welding of high-alloyed aluminium-zinc alloys,"['The automotive industry is currently facing major challenges. In the course of the enacting of comprehensive environmental regulations for the fuel consumption and CO2 emission of passenger vehicles in Europe and the world, the weight of future vehicles need to be considerably reduced. A weight reduction for automotive structures can be achieved by the substitution of heavy materials by lighter and stronger materials, the implementation of new designs and manufacturing technologies or ideally by a combination of both. High-alloyed Al-Zn alloys are promising candidates for the use as structural light-weight materials for the automotive industry. This is mainly due to their very high strength-todensity ratio in comparison to conventionally used steels and aluminium alloys. Laser beam welding is an efficient method for producing joints with high weld quality and is established in the industry since many years. However, it is well known that aluminium alloys with a high Zn content or, more precisely, with a high Zn+Mg+Cu content are hard to fusion weld or even unweldable due to the formation of severe weld discontinuities. And currently, there is a lack of approaches for solving these weldability problems, which finally results in a disregard of these alloys by the automotive industry. The present thesis aims at solving the laser weldability problems of these high-alloyed Al-Zn alloys. For this purpose a deep understanding of the theoretical fundamentals of laser weldability in terms of material properties and processes during laser beam welding was mandatory. By this means, typical reasons for weldability problems were derived and crucial influencing factors were identified. Based on the knowledge obtained, it was possible to develop two approaches for improving the laser weldability of high-alloyed Al-Zn alloys. The first approach implies the use of an appropriate filler material - namely vanadium - additional to the conventional filler wire recommended for welding Al-Zn alloys. In this regard, vanadium enables the manipulation of the material properties of the weld metal. This first approach is feasible for different laser systems used for welding. The second approach implies the use of a high-power fibre laser with a large beam diameter and a high beam quality. Here, the laser beam welding process itself is manipulated. This approach does not necessarily require a certain filler material. The effectiveness of both developed approaches was verified by their application to diverse high-alloyed Al-Zn alloys. The assessment of the resulting weld properties finally also allowed assessing the capability of the approaches for industrial applications. Here, the second approach excels in its versatility and capability for large-scale productions.', 'Die Automobilindustrie steht derzeit vor großen Herausforderungen. Im Zuge der Erlassung umfangreicher Umweltschutzbestimmungen für Kraftstoffverbrauch und CO2-Ausstoß von Personenkraftfahrzeugen, sowohl in Europa wie auch weltweit, muss das Gewicht zukünftiger Fahrzeuge deutlich vermindert werden. Eine Gewichtsreduzierung von Fahrzeugstrukturen kann durch die Substitution schwerer Werkstoffe durch leichtere und höher festere, sowie die Einführung neuer Design- und Fertigungskonzepte - oder idealerweise eine Kombination der beiden - erreicht werden. Hochlegierte Al-Zn-Legierungen sind aufgrund ihrer hohen Festigkeit und geringen Dichte im Vergleich zu herkömmlichen Al-Legierungen und Stahl vielversprechende Kandidaten für die Verwendung als leichter Strukturwerkstoff in der Automobilindustrie. Das Laserstrahlschweißen ist eine effiziente Methode zur Herstellung hochwertiger Schweißverbindungen und ist seit vielen Jahren in der Industrie etabliert. Al-Legierungen mit einem hohen Zinkgehalt bzw. mit einem hohen (Zn+Mg+Cu)-Gehalt gelten aufgrund der Bildung von schwerwiegenden Schweißfehlern im Allgemeinen als nur schwer schmelzschweißbar bzw. sogar unschweißbar. Derzeit gibt es keine Ansätze zur Lösung dieser Schweißbarkeitsprobleme, die letztendlich zu einer Missachtung dieser Legierung durch die Industrie führt. Die vorliegende Arbeit hat zum Ziel, die Schweißbarkeitsprobleme dieser vielversprechenden hochlegierten Al-Zn-Legierungen zu lösen. Dazu war zunächst ein umfangreiches Verständnis über die theoretischen Grundlagen der Laserschweißbarkeit im Sinne von Materialeigenschaften und Prozessen während des Laserstrahlschweißens erforderlich. Somit konnten die Ursachen für typische Schweißprobleme ermittelt werden sowie die entscheidenden Einflussfaktoren identifiziert werden. Basierend auf diesem Wissen war es anschließend möglich, Lösungsansätze zur Verbesserung der Laserschweißbarkeit hochlegierter Al-Zn-Legierungen zu entwickeln. Der erste Lösungsansatz beinhaltet die Verwendung eines geeigneten Schweißzusatzes - nämlich Vanadium - zusätzlich zum für Al-Zn-Legierungen empfohlenen konventionellen Zusatzdraht. Die Verwendung von Vanadium ermöglicht die Beeinflussung der Materialeigenschaften der Schmelze. Dieser erste Ansatz ist geeignet für verschiedene Laserschweißsysteme.

Signals or resources? : biosynthesis and accumulation of zwitterionic compatible solutes in marine phytoplankton and their role in environmental stress responses,"Marine phytoplankton are among the main sources of the zwitterionic sulfur compound dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP). Although the several functions of this metabolite in marine algae have largely been demonstrated, knowledge related to the environmental drivers of DMSP catabolism was still missing. In this work, the application of analytical and physiological methods enabled the exploration of conditions involved in DMSP degradation and its conversion into dimethylsulfide (DMS). Salinity and temperature affect biotic interactions and living organisms, which synthesize and accumulate organic metabolites with osmoregulatory and cryoprotectant properties, including DMSP, to mitigate adverse environmental conditions. Through analytical methods based on ultra-high-performance-liquid chromatography (UHPLC) and high-resolution-mass spectrometry (HRMS), we investigated further and expanded the group of phytoplankton osmolytes by adding cysteinolic acid and ectoine: their identities were confirmed through MS/MS experiments and co-elution with the corresponding synthetic standards, while their osmoregulatory properties were verified by investigating the algal cells at physiological and high salinity conditions. We also expanded our investigation on ectoine and cysteinolic acid distribution to the class of marine macroalgae by including in our screening the green seaweed Ulva sp. We investigated the cryoprotectant properties of ectoine and cysteinolic acid in these species. Interestingly, our results showed that both these metabolites were upregulated in U. mutabilis after a warm to cold temperature shift, thus demonstrating their role in thermotolerance. With our work, we therefore added ectoine and cysteinolic acid to the family of key compatible solutes produced by marine phytoplankton and provided new insights into the molecular responses of marine algae to environmental stressors.",gnd:4291820-0 gnd:4030509-0 gnd:4174642-9 gnd:4114549-5 gnd:4172911-0 gnd:4414892-6 gnd:4807318-0

About half of the Earth’s net primary production originates in the marine environment.

Particles present substrate-rich niches for particle-associated bacteria, but are rare in the marine system.

Probing Correlated Quantum Many-Body Systems at the Single-Particle Level,"How much knowledge can we gain about a physical system and to what degree can we control it? In quantum optical systems, such as ion traps or neutral atoms in cavities, single particles and their correlations can now be probed in a way that is fundamentally limited only by the laws of quantum mechanics. In contrast, quantum many-body systems pose entirely new challenges due to the enormous number of microscopic parameters and their small length- and short time-scales. This thesis describes a new approach to probing quantum many-body systems at the level of individual particles: Using high-resolution, single-particle-resolved imaging and manipulation of strongly correlated atoms, single atoms can be detected and manipulated due to the large length and time-scales and the precise control of internal degrees of freedom.

Regionally adaptable ground-motion Prediction Equations (GMPEs) for seismic hazard analysis,"Adjustment of empirically derived ground motion prediction equations (GMPEs), from a data- rich region/site where they have been derived to a data-poor region/site, is one of the major challenges associated with the current practice of seismic hazard analysis.

The functional forms of such GMPEs are based upon the concepts borrowed from the Fourier spectral representation of ground motion. This assumption regarding the validity of Fourier spectral concepts in the response spectral domain can lead to consequences which cannot be explained physically. In this thesis, firstly results from an investigation that explores the relationship between Fourier and response spectra, and implications of this relationship on the adjustment issues of GMPEs, are presented.

The study focuses on new recovered material and on material deposit in historical collections. Since the classic monographs of the early 19th century, crinoids are nearly unstudied in modern view. They are only periphery mentioned within the standard works Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontologyʺ and Fossil Crinoidsʺ. The Eifel has to be characterised as the global hotspot of Middle Devonian crinoids. Because of the high diversity, selected groups of each of the four occurring Palaeozoic subclasses are studied in the course of this work: 1.

Protein engineering and synthetic pathways in Escherichia coli for effective production of 5-hydroxytryptophan and serotonin,"['Metabolic engineering has improved the production of tryptophan in E. coli during the last two decades, opening itself a plethora of opportunities for the production of tryptophan derivatives. 5-Hydroxytryptophan (5HTP) and serotonin are two important derivatives not only important for their pharmaceutical value but also because they could serve as a precursor of other molecules which includes sleep cycle regulator, anti-migraine medications, sedatives, anticonvulsants, antitumors, antimicrobials, antivirals, among others. To the present, 5HTP is mainly obtained by extraction from the plant Griffonia simplicifolia and serotonin is produced by chemical synthesis. In both cases, the processes involve the use of organic solvents and high temperature during the procedure. Moreover, in the case of serotonin, its chemical synthesis starts from a complex molecule (5-benzyloxyindole). A simple biotechnological method for the production of these compounds is desired. This dissertation presents the work done in the extension of the tryptophan metabolism for the production of 5HTP and serotonin. For this purpose, serotonin production via tryptamine and via 5HTP were compared and analyzed. In both cases, the hydroxylation step seemed to be the bottleneck due to the low activity of the enzymes when expressed in E. coli and the requirement of a cofactor, plus its regeneration pathway. The serotonin production pathway via 5HTP was chosen, and for this purpose, an aromatic amino acid hydroxylase from Cupriavidus taiwanensis (CtAAAH) was selected using an in silico structure-based approach. Several substrate-determining residues were predicted and selected using sequence, phylogenetic and functional divergence analyses. Whole cells analysis with the wild-type and variants were done to study the shift of the enzyme preference from phenylalanine to tryptophan. All the variants increased the tryptophan hydroxylation activity in detriment to phenylalanine. The best performer, CtAAAH-W192F, was transformed into a strain that had the tryptophanase A gene disrupted and carried a human tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) regeneration pathway. The resulting strain was capable of synthesizing 2.5 mM 5HTP after 24 hours in medium supplied with tryptophan. After this first rational design round, a second semi-rational approach was selected to improve the efficiency of the enzyme. A tryptophan intracellular concentration sensor was used to screen two independent libraries, and the variants found in the best performer of each library were combined to create CtAAAH-LC. This double mutant showed higher activity and reaction velocity than its predecessor. CtAAAH-LC was transformed into a tryptophan producer strain (S028), which had been previously modified by the addition of a pterin (a cofactor that is consumed during hydroxylation) regeneration pathway. In this case, 5HTP was synthesized from glucose. Tryptophan decarboxylase (TDC) was incorporated in the 5HTP producer strain to produce serotonin from glucose. However, the serotonin production was low and undesired side reactions were identified. To circumvent this problem, a two-step system was constructed in which the 5HTP production and the serotonin conversion are separated. In this work, results of the highest biotechnologically produced concentration of 5HTP reported so far are presented, for this purpose protein engineering was done in CtAAAH and a synthetic pathway was incorporated in E. coli. Afterwards, 5HTP was decarboxylated to produce serotonin in a second fermentation. This is the first report of serotonin production from glucose. Still, the process can be further optimized by combining the hydroxylation and decarboxylation reaction in one strain. TDC selectivity can be engineered to shift the preference toward 5HTP in detriment of tryptophan. In this case, the development of a novel biosensor sensitive to 5HTP is critical for selection.', 'Metabolic Engineering hat in den letzten zwei Jahrzehnten erhebliche Verbesserungen der Produktion von Tryptophan in E. coli ermöglicht und somit zahlreiche Möglichkeiten für die Produktion von Tryptophan-Derivaten eröffnet. 5-Hydroxy-tryptophan (5HTP) und Serotonin sind zwei wichtige Beispiele hierfür, welche nicht nur im Hinblick auf ihren pharmazeutischen Wert bedeutend sind, sondern auch als Vorläufer anderer Moleküle dienen können. Hierzu gehören unter anderem Schlafzyklusregulatoren, Antimigräne-Medikamente, Sedativa, Antikonvulsiva, Medikamente zur Tumorbekämpfung, antimikrobielle Mittel, antivirale Mittel und viele weitere mehr. Gegenwärtig wird 5HTP hauptsächlich durch Extraktion aus der Pflanze Griffonia simplicifolia gewonnen; Serotonin wird durch chemische Synthese hergestellt. In beiden Fällen werden organische Lösungsmittel und hohe Temperaturen benötigt. Außerdem beginnt im Falle von Serotonin die chemische Synthese bei einem komplexen Molekül (5-Benzyloxyindol). Daher ist ein einfaches biotechnologisches Verfahren zur Herstellung dieser Verbindungen erwünscht. Diese Dissertation umfasst die Arbeiten hinsichtlich der Erweiterung des Tryptophan-Metabolismus‘ für die Produktion von 5HTP und Serotonin. Zu diesem Zweck wurde die Serotoninproduktion via Tryptamin oder 5HTP verglichen und analysiert. In beiden Fällen schien der Hydroxylierungsschritt einen Engpass darzustellen, da die Enzyme geringe Aktivität aufwiesen, wenn sie in E. coli exprimiert wurden. Ein weiterer Aspekt war die Notwendigkeit eines Kofaktors und eines entsprechenden Regenerations¬wegs. Die Entscheidung fiel zugunsten des Serotonin-Produktionsweg via 5HTP. Hierfür wurde eine aromatische Aminosäure-Hydroxylase aus Cupriavidus taiwanensis (CtAAAH) unter Verwendung eines in silico strukturbasierten Ansatzes ausgewählt. Mehrere substratpräferenzbestimmende Aminosäurereste wurden unter Verwendung von Sequenz-, phylogenetischer und funktioneller Divergenzanalyse vorhergesagt und ausgewählt. Ganzzellanalysen wurden mit dem Wildtyp und den Mutanten durchgeführt, um die Verschiebung der Enzympräferenz von Phenylalanin hin zu Tryptophan zu untersuchen. Alle Varianten erhöhten die Hydroxylierungsaktivität von Tryptophan zuungunsten von Phenylalanin. Die beste Variante, CtAAAH-W192F, wurde in einen Stamm mit inaktiviertem tryptophanase A-Gen und einem menschlichen Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4)-Regenera-tions¬weg transformiert. Der resultierende Stamm war in der Lage, 2,5 mM 5HTP nach 24 Stunden in Medium mit Tryptophan zu synthetisieren. Nach dieser ersten rationalen Entwurfsrunde wurde ein zweiter semi-rationaler Ansatz ausgewählt, um die Effizienz des Enzyms zu verbessern. Ein intra-zellulärer Tryptophan-Konzentrationssensor wurde verwendet, um zwei unabhängige Varianten-sammlungen (Library) zu durchsuchen. Die besten Varianten aus jeder Library wurden kombiniert, um CtAAAH-LC zu erzeugen. Diese Doppelmutante zeigte eine erhöhte Aktivität und Reaktions-geschwindigkeit als ihr Vorgänger. CtAAAH-LC wurde in einen Tryptophan-Produzentenstamm (S028) mit zuvor hinzugefügtem Pterin-Regenerationsweg transformiert (Pterin ist ein Kofaktor, der während der Hydroxylierung verbraucht wird). In diesem Fall wurde 5HTP aus Glukose synthetisiert. Tryptophan-Decarboxylase (TDC) wurde in den 5HTP-Produzentenstamm eingebaut, um Serotonin aus Glukose zu erzeugen. Allerdings war die Serotoninproduktion niedrig und es wurden unerwünschte Nebenreaktionen identifiziert. Ein zweistufiges System wurde entwickelt, um dieses Problem zu überwinden. Hierdurch wurden die 5HTP-Produktion und die Serotonin-Umwandlung voneinander getrennt. In dieser Arbeit werden Ergebnisse mit der bisher höchsten berichteten biotechnologisch hergestellten Konzentration von 5HTP gezeigt. Zu diesem Zweck wurde Protein-Engineering an CtAAAH durchgeführt und ein neuer Syntheseweg in E. coli implementiert. Anschließend wurde Serotonin mittels Decarboxy-lierung von 5HTP in einer zweiten Fermentation produziert. Dies ist der erste Bericht einer Serotoninproduktion aus Glukose. Das Verfahren kann durch Kombination der Hydroxylierungs- und Decarboxylierungsreaktion in einem Stamm weiter optimiert werden. Die TDC-Selektivität kann in Richtung 5HTP zuungunsten von Tryptophan verschoben werden. Hierfür ist die Entwicklung eines neuen 5HTP-sensitiven Biosensors entscheidend.']",gnd:7684405-5 gnd:4346801-9 gnd:4326370-7 gnd:4054614-7
The narrow line region of active galaxies,"This thesis presents an imaging and spectroscopic study of the narrow-line region (NLR) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We find a correlation between size and luminosity of the NLR with different slopes for type-1 and type-2 AGNs which can be explained by the observers viewing angle and a receding torus. The radial properties of the NLR gas, such as reddening, electron density, ionization parameter, and velocity field are analyzed. We derive pure emission-line spectra and use the resulting absorption-line free ratios for spatially resolved spectral diagnostics. We find a transition between the AGN-excited NLR and the surrounding star-forming regions, allowing us to determine the NLR size independent of stellar contamination. The electron density and ionization parameter decrease with radius indicating that the NLR is photoionized by the central source only.The velocity fields suggest a disky NLR gas distribution with the torus axis lying in the galaxy disk.",gnd:4233554-1
Molecular aspects of sex and trisporoid signalling in mucoralean fungi,"A haploid asexual phase predominates life cycle in Mucorales, but adverse extrinsic factors along with darkness promote “sexual communication”. Little is known about the physiological functions of the enzymes and products involved in the sexual phase. We hypothesise that each of the intermediate trisporoid has a specific regulatory function upon the genes linked to sex pheromone production. Real-time quantitative PCR kinetics conducted in Blakeslea trispora (Choanephoraceae), displayed a high transcriptional upregulation during sexual phase for carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase gene tsp3. In Mucor circinelloides f. lusitanicus (Mucoraceae), two putative carotenoid cleavage oxygenases (CarS and AcaA) were identified based on phylogeny and amino acid sequence similarity. Unlike Blakeslea, during sex, Mucor had no significant transcriptional up regulation for carotenoid cleavage oxygenases. CrgA, a repressor of carotenogenesis, has no regulatory function on carotenoid cleavage as transcript levels of carS or acaA were on par among wild type Mucor (-) and its crgA mutant. Heterologous co-expression of TSP3 with β-carotene overproducing plasmid through in vivo enzyme assay and LC-MS analysis led to the identification of β-apo-12’- carotenal, as first apocarotenoid in Blakeslea. Trisporin C stimulated gene transcription in Mucor (-) and had no impact upon Blakeslea. Supplementation of the first C18 trisporoid, β-apo-13-carotenone (D’orenone), entailed a positive feedback regulation on carRP/carRA and acaA/tsp3 gene expression in Mucor (-) and Blakeslea (+). Our data supports the hypothesis that mode of action of trisporoids varies among genotypes and growth phases which in turn lead to the concept of “specific chemical dialect”. We successfully detected sex hormone and its highly abundant precursor β-carotene in the gametangial phase in M. mucedo (Mucoraceae) by a non-invasive, novel approach of Coherent anti- Stokes Raman Spectroscopy (CARS).",gnd:4054684-6 gnd:4054683-4 gnd:4340436-4 gnd:4316523-0
The geothermal potential of Luxembourg : geological and thermal exploration for deep geothermal reservoirs in Luxembourg and the surroundings,"The aim of this work is the evaluation of the geothermal potential of Luxembourg. The approach consists in a joint interpretation of different types of information necessary for a first rather qualitative assessment of deep geothermal reservoirs in Luxembourg and the adjoining regions in the surrounding countries of Belgium, France and Germany. For the identification of geothermal reservoirs by exploration, geological, thermal, hydrogeological and structural data are necessary. Until recently, however, reliable information about the thermal field and the regional geology, and thus about potential geothermal reservoirs, was lacking. Before a proper evaluation of the geothermal potential can be performed, a comprehensive survey of the geology and an assessment of the thermal field are required.

Semiclassical approximations in infinitely connected spaces,"Zusammenfassung: The aim of this dissertation is to derive, from first principles, semiclassical approximations for quantum mechanical systems whose configuration space is infinitely connected. The emergence of such spaces is intimately related to magnetic forces which are classically inaccessible to the system under consideration, but which nevertheless influence the latter’s quantum mechanical behavior. While a comprehensible analysis of the corresponding exact quantum mechanical solutions is often obstructed by their complicated form, essential features of the dynamics collapse into discontinuities in Gutzwiller’s semiclassical propagator. The intention is thus to determine the origin of these discontinuities, in anticipation of an accessible semiclassical picture.The first system under consideration is a charged particle propagating in the presence of an Aharonov-Bohm magnetic flux line. The infinite connectedness of the problem arises as a consequence of the discontinuous dependence of Dirac’s magnetic phase factor on the number of windings of any closed curve encircling the flux. A novel semiclassical limit is introduced for the propagator of the otherwise free particle. While this limit directly produces the semiclassical approximation of Gutzwiller in backward propagation direction, in forward direction it describes two half-waves which acquire Dirac’s magnetic phase as if passing above and below the flux line, respectively. This splitting of the wave mediates a smooth transition of the propagator’s phase from negative to positive values, and gives rise to an interference pattern which is entirely determined by the contribution to Hamilton’s principal function associated with the angular motion of the particle with respect to the flux line. In a subsequent semiclassical limit, in which Planck’s constant is neglected against any nonzero such angular contribution, this smooth transition is no longer resolved and Gutzwiller’s expression is obtained also in forward propagationdirection, where its phase is discontinuous.In order to describe further potentials besides the flux, our thus-obtained approximation is amended accordingly and iterated as in a path-integral approach, followed by an evaluation by the method of stationary phase. To this end, the applicability of a method existing for this purpose for Cartesian problems is extended to accommodate, for the first time, also path-integral expressions parametrized by generalized coordin ...",gnd:4296820-3 gnd:4300046-0
Total synthesis of new microbial sphingolipid-type signaling molecules,"Sphingolipids are found in mammalian and bacterial membranes where they exert multiple intra- and intercellular functions. Therefore, binding partners of sphingolipids provide excellent targets for therapeutic approaches. Structurally related sulfonolipids (RIFs) are also of great interest for the interspecific interaction of Salpingoeca rosetta. In the present work, new access routes to both classes of compounds are demonstrated by the means of total chemical synthesis. Using a hydrozirconation/transmetallation reaction and a three-step one-pot reaction protection/deprotection sequence, several unnatural 2S,3S-6-hydroxy-4E-sphingenin-containing sphingolipids were prepared in only three (protected) or four (fully deprotected) consecutive synthetic steps. Among them is a fluorescently labeled derivative suitable for future biological studies. Furthermore, the first total synthesis of two RIF-2 diastereomers and one congener is reported, using 15 and eight synthetic steps, respectively. A decarboxylative cross-coupling reaction is used to synthesize the required branched alpha-hydroxy fatty acids. Furthermore, three different strategies are discussed in terms of their suitability for the synthesis of sulfonolipids: 1) the ""cysteine"" strategy, which uses cysteine as the central building block; 2) the ""thioligation"" strategy, which provides for a reaction similar to native chemical ligation to generate the peptide bond; and 3) the ""late stage"" strategy, which provides for the introduction of sulfur at the end of the total synthesis. Finally, the synthetic compounds are compared to the natural isolates in terms of their properties.",gnd:4070991-7 gnd:1033635499 gnd:4165471-7 gnd:4182242-0

Boundary Physics and Bulk-Boundary Correspondence in Topological Phases of Matter,"[""This thesis extends our understanding of systems of independent electrons by developing a generalization of Bloch’s Theorem which is applicable whenever translational symmetry is broken solely due to arbitrary boundary conditions. The thesis begins with a historical overview of topological condensed matter physics, placing the work in context, before introducing the generalized form of Bloch's Theorem. A cornerstone of electronic band structure and transport theory in crystalline matter, Bloch's Theorem is generalized via a reformulation of the diagonalization problem in terms of corner-modified block-Toeplitz matrices and, physically, by allowing the crystal momentum to take complex values. This formulation provides exact expressions for all the energy eigenvalues and eigenstates of the single-particle Hamiltonian. By precisely capturing the interplay between bulk and boundary properties, this affords an exact analysis of several prototypical models relevant to symmetry-protected topological phases of matter, including a characterization of zero-energy localized boundary excitations in both topological insulators and superconductors.

The key parameter adapted via temperature is the group velocity dispersion of the fiber modes, which determines the nonlinear pulse dynamics. Different soliton dynamics, e.g. fission, breathing, breakdown, and tunneling, are studied experimentally and numerically exciting higher-order modes in approximately 10 cm-long carbon disulfide-filled step-index fibers with ultrashort sub-40 fs pulses centered at a wavelength of 1.57 μm. By modifying the temperature of defined fiber sections, strong wavelength shifts of up to 33 nm/Kelvin are detected. The generated dispersive waves reach infrared wavelengths of up to 2.7 micrometers. The experimental results showing these strong thermo-spectral shifts are in good agreement with numerical simulations solving the nonlinear Schrödinger equation and corresponding phase matching calculations. The nonlinear simulations give further insights into the soliton dynamics taking place inside the fiber. In this way, the different soliton processes can be identified and precisely controlled via temperature. Parameters studies are conducted to learn about the optima and limits of the different soliton effects. Besides studying the influence of the absolute fiber temperature of a fixed fiber section, the impact of the length and position of the temperature-controlled fiber sections is investigated in experiments and simulations. Recompression-induced generation of additional dispersive waves is realized via soliton tunneling through normal dispersive regions of varying length. In summary, this work demonstrates how different flat group velocity dispersion profiles with two ZDWs can be obtained in higher-order modes by controlling the temperature of liquid-core step-index fibers. The thereby strongly varied soliton dynamics result in significant modifications of the generated supercontinua.",gnd:4135213-0 gnd:4770095-6 gnd:1120315468 gnd:4059427-0

Light-driven diffusioosmosis : the manipulation of colloids using azobenzene containing surfactant,"The emergence of microfluidics created the need for precise and remote control of micron-sized objects. I demonstrate how light-sensitive motion can be induced at the micrometer scale by a simple addition of a photosensitive surfactant, which makes it possible to trigger hydrophobicity with light. With point-like laser irradiation, radial inward and outward hydrodynamic surface flows are remotely switched on and off. In this way, ensembles of microparticles can be moved toward or away from the irradiation center. Particle motion is analyzed according to varying parameters, such as surfactant and salt concentration, illumination condition, surface hydrophobicity, and surface structure. The physical origin of this process is the so-called light-driven diffusioosmosis (LDDO), a phenomenon that was discovered in the framework of this thesis and is described experimentally and theoretically in this work. To give a brief explanation, a focused light irradiation induces a local photoisomerization that creates a concentration gradient at the…",gnd:4112704-3 gnd:4012277-3 gnd:4803438-1 gnd:4043973-2 gnd:4128790-3 gnd:4175378-1 gnd:4164695-2 gnd:4143803-6 gnd:4057472-6

Learning to live with climate change : from anxiety to transformation,"This imaginative and empowering book explores the ways that our emotions entangle us with climate change and offers strategies for engaging with climate anxiety that can contribute to social transformation. Climate educator Blanche Verlie draws on feminist, more-than-human and affect theories to argue that people in high-carbon societies need to learn to ‘live-with’ climate change: to appreciate that human lives are interconnected with the climate, and to cultivate the emotional capacities needed to respond to the climate crisis. Learning to Live with Climate Change explores the cultural, interpersonal and sociological dimensions of ecological distress. The book engages with Australia’s 2019/2020 ‘Black Summer’ of bushfires and smoke, undergraduate students’ experiences of climate change, and contemporary activist movements such as the youth strikes for climate. Verlie outlines how we can collectively attune to, live with, and respond to the unsettling realities of climate collapse while counteracting domineering ideals of ‘climate control.’ This impressive and timely work is both deeply philosophical and immediately practical. Its accessible style and real-world relevance ensure it will be valued by those researching, studying and working in diverse fields such as sustainability education, climate communication, human geography, cultural studies, environmental sociology and eco-psychology, as well as the broader public.",gnd:4031883-7 gnd:4077587-2 gnd:4164199-1
Numerical studies of higher-dimensional localized black holes and holographic Weyl semimetals,"In our everyday lives, we experience three spatial dimensions and a fourth dimension of time. Neverthe-less, several intricate problems of modern physics may be mastered with the introduction of additional dimensions, including the hierarchy problem and the unification of the fundamental forces. Furthermore, dualities between certain strongly coupled quantum field theories and particular gravitational theories in higher dimensions were conjectured based on string theory, which generically comes with the premise of extra dimensions. Specifically, the AdS/CFT correspondence or rather gauge/gravity duality motivated the study of a wide variety of higher dimensional gravitational theories with additional matter. The first part of this thesis covers the numerical construction of localized black holes in five, six and ten dimensional Kaluza-Klein theories. We focus on static, asymptotically flat vacuum solutions of Einstein’s field equations with one periodic compact dimension. Our study concentrates on the critical regime, where the poles of the localized black holes are about to merge. We utilize a well adapted multi-domain pseudo-spectral scheme for obtaining high accuracy results and investigate the phase diagram of the localized solutions far beyond previous results. A spiral phase space structure is found for the five and six dimensional setups which matches to the results that were recently obtained for non-uniform black strings. On the contrary, the phase space structure of the ten dimensional configuration exhibits no spiraling behavior of the thermodynamical quantities. These critical exponents were extracted from the numerical data of the aforementioned configurations and show an excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions. In the second part of this thesis, the AdS/CFT correspondence is employed for studying strongly coupled Weyl semimetals. More concretely, we numerically investigate the effects of inhomogenities within a holographic Weyl semimetal by using a pseudo-spectral scheme, including interfaces of Weyl semimetals and the impact of time independent disorder. When studying interfaces between differentWeyl semimetal phases, we observe the appearance of an electric current, that is restricted to the interface in the presence of an electric chemical potential. The related integrated current is universal in the sense that it only depends on the topology of the phases. These results may shed some light on anomalous transport for inhomogeneous magnetic fields. As another point, we study the effects of time independent one-dimensional disorder on the holographic Weyl semimetal quantum phase transition (QPT), with a particular focus on the quantum critical region. We observe the smearing of the sharp QPT linked to the appearance of rare regions where the order parameter is locally non-zero. We discuss the role of the disorder correlation and we compare our results to expectations from condensed matter theory at weak coupling. We also analyze the interplay of finite temperature and disorder.",gnd:4338132-7 gnd:4025643-1 gnd:4195351-4 gnd:4224276-9 gnd:4158819-8 gnd:4202326-9 gnd:4174149-3 gnd:4148259-1 gnd:4053793-6 gnd:7752120-1

The near infrared activity of Sagittarius A*,"The meaning of my thesis was to obtain new insights about the supermassive Black Hole in the center of our Milky Way and its accretion flow. The non-thermal radio, X-ray, and near-infrared source Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) is the electro-magnetic manifestation of the Black Hole. Sgr A* is a unique source to study the accretion onto a very massive compact object as it is the closest galactic nucleus. For this work I conducted observations as well as theoretical computations. The near-infrared camera CONICA in combination with the adaptive optics device NAOS at ESO's Very Large Telescope in Chile were used for the observations. The goal of our group was in particular to find further evidence for a quasi-periodic signal of ~17 minutes in radiation outbursts from Sgr A* that has been reported for the first time in 2003. The radiation outbursts - most often termed `flares' - are periods of ~50 - 130 minutes in which the flux of Sgr A* in the near-infrared rises up to a factor of ten. The quasi-periodic sub-structure thereby manifests itself as sub-flares with a constant separation superimposed on the larger, underlying flare.

The fate of singularities in quantum cosmology and the application of generalized effective equations to constrained quantum systems,"The first part of the thesis is concerned with the fate of singularities in quantum cosmology. The second part addresses the derivation of predictions from quantum cosmology. In the first part, two classes of cosmological models were studied. In the first class of models, the universe evolves to or emerges from a big-rip singularity. Here, energy density, pressure and scale factor diverge after a finite amount of time. This type of singularity arises rather generically in cosmological models with phantom dark energy. For each of these phantom-field models, the corresponding scenario with ordinary scalar field was studied. The scalar field induced a big-bang singularity. The second class of models studied was dominated by a big-brake singularity. At the big brake, the universe evolution comes to a halt due to an infinite deceleration. The motivation behind this choice of models was the occurrence of a singularity at large scale factor. The major question pursued was whether these types of singularity were resolved on the quantum level. If such singularities were resolved in quantum cosmology, this would imply that quantum gravitational effects can occur in the macroscopic universe. After devising classical models that contain the respective singularity, I subjected these models to quantization which was carried out in the geometrodynamical approach. The governing equation is then the WheelerDeWitt equation ...",gnd:4302168-2
The Occurrence of Separate Opinions at the Federal Constitutional Court : An Analysis with a Novel Database,"Courts with the right to constitutional review exert considerable power in a political system. However, especially for Kelsenian constitutional courts there are hardly any large-N studies. This is mainly due to a lack of data. For the German Federal Constitutional Court, this gap has been closed by building a novel database, the development of which is depicted in this book. Employing data from this database, the occurrence of separate opinions in general and their different types in particular are analyzed. The book introduces a new, universal theory that reconciles and expands existing explanations. In a second step, the theory is applied to the German Federal Constitutional Court. It can be proven that one factor that has been neglected so far plays a decisive role: The judges' behavior depends on the profession they pursue after their time in office.

Untersuchung zur Aktivierung von STAT durch Cytotoxische-Nekrotisierende Faktoren,"Zusammenfassung: RhoA is reportedly involved in signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)-dependent transcription. However, the pathway connecting the GTPase and STAT signaling has not been characterized.   Here, we made use of bacterial toxins, which directly activate Rho GTPases to analyze this pathway. Cytotoxic necrotizing factors (CNFs) are produced by pathogenic Escherichia coli strains and by Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. They activate small GTPases of the Rho family by deamidation of a glutamine, which is crucial for GTP hydrolysis.   We show that RhoA activation leads to phosphorylation and activation of STAT3 and identify signal proteins involved in this pathway. RhoA-dependent STAT3 stimulation requires ROCK and Jun kinase activation as well as AP1-induced protein synthesis. The secretion of one or more factors activates the JAK-STAT pathway in an auto/paracrine manner.

Penalized regression methods with sparse variables for modeling binary outcomes,"Abstract: Modeling binary outcomes plays an important role in epidemiology. It is often used to study the influence of risk factors on the occurrence or onset of a disease. Logistic regression via maximum likelihood (ML) has become the established analysis method of choice. However, risk factors with very low prevalences are problematic. Risk estimation of such sparse covariates via ML often suffers from strong bias. Even though this challenge is common in epidemiology, investigations into appropriate methodology exists are few in number.<br>The dissertation is a treatise of solutions in this context via penalized regression. Penalizing the likelihood function makes estimation even of very sparse covariates possible when classical ML methods often fail. In recent years, penalized regression has received increased attention in statistical literature, and as a result, a number of different variations exist. However, these methods have received little to no attention in epidemiologic studies.<br>In this dissertation penalized methods will for the first time be investigated in the context of sparse covariates. Firstly, the theory concerning state-of-the-art penalization methods will be treated. Further, the investigated methods will be studied using data from epidemiological studies.

Variation of candidate genes related to climate change in European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.),"European beech (Fagus sylvatica) is an ecologically and economically important tree species in Central Europe. Although beech is a highly competitive species, it does not colonize all habitats in its area of distribution, e.g., very dry habitats. Climate change scenarios predict higher annual mean temperatures and a decrease of precipitation in the summer months. This may increase the drought stress risk in summer and the late frost risk in spring. A candidate gene approach and the analysis of variation within these candidate genes were used in this study to investigate the genetic background of drought stress and bud phenology. Populations along a precipitation gradient in Northern Germany were studied. Additionally, a controlled drought stress experiment was conducted. The neutral genetic diversity analysed with nine microsatellite markers was found to be high for all locations and is comparable to other beech populations. Partial sequences of ten candidate genes were identified at the genomic level and SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) were analysed. The nucleotide diversity range is comparable to other tree species, whereas the mean nucleotide diversity is comparatively low. All populations were found to be significantly different with respect to genetic differentiation ...",gnd:4672756-5 gnd:4164199-1 gnd:4178516-2
Mikrostrukturelle Betrachtung des Einflusses von Poren auf die mechanischen Eigenschaften von faserverstärkten Kunststoffen,"['The subject of this work is the investigation of the influence of voids on the mechanical properties of fibre-reinforced polymers (FRP) under compression. To specify the damage accumulation of FRP in the presence of voids, the complex three dimensional structure of the composite including several voids were analysed and a reduced mechanical model composite was derived. The reduced model consists of the matrix system and a unique void, which is squeezed between two fibres by using an injection method. The experimental investigation of the model composite included the description of the stress- and strain behaviour of the matrix using photoelasticity and digital image correlation technology. Additionally, a numerical examination of a parameterised model composite and an analytical study of the stability of a single fibre was conducted. As a result of the experimental investigation of the model composite consisting of ten fibres embedded in a matrix, the failure initiation and propagation could be observed. Supported by the findings from the numerical examination and the analytical study, the most impact on the failure initiation has the foundation of the fibre as well as the bonding between fibre and matrix. Both facts are leading to a premature fibre-matrix debonding with ongoing loss of stability of the fibre finally resulting in fibre kinking. Because of the rearrangement of stresses further overloaded fibres failed. Additional studies on transparent glassfibre reinforced polymers including a unique void showed, that the gained experience made on the examination of the model composite could be transferred to real existed composites.', 'Die vorliegende Arbeit befasst sich mit der Untersuchung des Einflusses von Poren auf die mechanischen Eigenschaften von Faser-Kunststoff-Verbunden (FKV) unter Drucklast. Um die Schadensentwicklung durch Poren in einem FKV näher be\\-schrei\\-ben zu können, wurde der komplexe dreidimensionale strukturelle Aufbau des Verbundes inklusive der Poren analysiert und dieser in einen vereinfachten modellhaften Verbund überführt. Der modellhafte Verbund besteht aus der Matrix und mindestens zwei Fasern, zwischen denen eine einzelne Pore platziert wurde. Neben der experimentellen Untersuchung des modellhaften Probekörpers, welche die Betrachtung des Spannungs- und Dehnungsverhaltens der Matrix mittels der optischen Spannungsanalyse und digitalen Bildkorrelation beinhaltet, wurde zusätzlich der Verbund mit Hilfe der Finite-Elemente-Methode numerisch in einem parametrisierten Modell abgebildet und das Stabilitätsverhalten einer Faser analytisch beschrieben. Insbesondere die experimentelle Untersuchung erlaubte es, bei der Verwendung von zehn Fasern im modellhaften Probekörper die Schadensentwicklung in der unmittelbaren Umgebung einer Pore schrittweise zu beobachten. Gestützt durch Erkenntnisse aus der numerischen und analytischen Betrachtung konnte festgestellt werden, dass sowohl die Art und Weise der Stützung der Faser durch die Matrix, als auch deren Haftung untereinander versagensrelevant sind. Beide Aspekte führen zu einer frühzeitigen longitudinalen Ablösung der Faser von der Matrix mit anschließendem Stabilitätsverlust der Faser durch deren Ausknicken. Dies ist Ursache für weitere Faserbrüche, die aufgrund der Lastumlagerung initiiert werden.

Hybrid nanolayer architectures for ultrafast acousto-plasmonics in soft matter,"The goal of the presented work is to explore the interaction between gold nanorods (GNRs) and hyper-sound waves. For the generation of the hyper-sound I have used Azobenzene-containing polymer transducers. Multilayer polymer structures with well-defined thicknesses and smooth interfaces were built via layer-by-layer deposition. Anionic polyelectrolytes with Azobenzene side groups (PAzo) were alternated with cationic polymer PAH, for the creation of transducer films. PSS/PAH multilayer were built for spacer layers, which do not absorb in the visible light range. The properties of the PAzo/PAH film as a transducer are carefully characterized by static and transient optical spectroscopy. The optical and mechanical properties of the transducer are studied on the picosecond time scale. In particular the relative change of the refractive index of the photo-excited and expanded PAH/PAzo is Δn/n = - 2.6*10‐4.

Price and product-mix decisions under different cost systems,"Philipp Plank analyses the question, what drives the quality of cost-systems and is the quality of cost-systems directly and at best positively related to the firms' performance. In other words, is it worth investing in complex cost allocation systems or are there environmental and/or production settings in which less enhanced systems perform adequately. Using simulations, a benchmark firm (first-best solution) perfectly allocating cost to products is compared to firms implementing heuristic cost-allocation schemes (second-best solution) to identify the profit gap resulting from decisions based on limited information. Into this discussion, the idea of cost-stickiness is integrated, thereby indicating a new planning approach.

Introduction of nanocarbon materials into bulk-heterojunction hybrid solar cells based on colloidal CdSe quantum dots and conjugated polymers,"Abstract: Solution-processed solar cells based on organic–inorganic hybrid materials have been developed as an alternative route towards low-cost fabrication, high efficiency, light-weight and flexible large-area devices. Hybrid solar cells are in principle comparable to that of organic solar cells; the only difference is that inorganic semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are used as electron acceptors instead of fullerene derivatives such as PCBM. However, this type of solar cells reported thus far generally suffers from a low power conversion efficiency (PCE) and poor device long-term stability. These problems mainly originate from the limitation in electron conductivity and mobility of hybrid solar cells. Hence, the design of a more continuous electron-transport pathway combined with environmental stability should greatly enhance the performance of hybrid solar cells. In this context, nanocarbon-based materials such as CNTs and graphene, which possess excellent environmental stability and high charge mobility, are ideal organic compounds to be combined with inorganic semiconductor QDs. In this thesis, functionalized nanocarbon materials, graphene oxide (GO) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were combined with CdSe QDs to form a novel hybrid nanocarbon/CdSe QDs solar cell. The hybrid materials were successfully utilized in a photoactive layer of hybrid solar cells, resulting in remarkable long-term stability improvement. About 85 % of the original PCE remained after storage in a glove box for one year without any further encapsulation. In addition, a modified anode of a hybrid solar cell has been performed by incorporating solution-processable reduced GO (rGO) between transparent indium tin oxide (ITO) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(4-styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)  layers. The device with a GO buffer layer, thermally-reduced at ambient atmosphere, exhibited a remarkable improvement in PCE compared to devices without any interfacial layer, indicating that rGO can effectively decrease charge recombination processes by facilitating efficient hole collection",gnd:4263396-5 gnd:4147107-6 gnd:4181740-0 gnd:1085167224 gnd:4127243-2 gnd:7649023-3

Ostrakoden und Foraminiferen aus athalassischen Gewässern und deren Anwendung für die Rekonstruktion quartärer Ökosysteme,"Athalassic waters are characterised by elevated salinity and continental location with full separation from the sea. Faunal assemblages of athalassic waters are individually distinct and characteristic for specific salinity ranges. They are never, however, identical to fully marine assemblages. Athalassic taxa derive from the marginal marine, intertidal zone, where instable ecological conditions require a high adaptability of species. The present thesis identifies, documents and classifies athalassic foraminifer and ostracod associations and applies them for palaeoenvironmental reconstructions. The classification of athalassic waters based on ostracod and foraminifer assemblages needs a specialised methodology because of generally low diversity and high ecological tolerances of typical species, especially towards salinity. Additional methods allow to compensate for this weakness; morphological features as malformations in foraminifer tests as well as noding and sieve pore variability in Cyprideis torosa are applicable for reconstructing salinity changes of the past. Athalassic waters of the low salinity range are characterised by brackish water and tolerant freshwater taxa, dominance of brackish water species, however, is typical for higher salinities. Hypersaline waters are inhabited by a few euryhaline species only, often occurring in very high numbers because of lacking competing species. Some species of marginal marine origin, often associated with salinity-tolerant freshwater species, are typical for athalassic waters, as a generally low diversity as well. If Foraminifera occur, a high proportion of their tests is malformatted. Climatically generated athalassic waters are located in arid climate zones while those with geogenic salinity are typical for humid climate zones because of a high precipitation/evaporation ratio. Hypersaline waters are of climatogenic type and characterised by very low diversity and the exclusive occurrence of euryhaline taxa.",gnd:4170777-1 gnd:4293663-9 gnd:4488988-4

Another aim was to produce a closed and stabile crusty film of zeolites on the surface of finemeshed metal substrates.

Diamantbasierte Raman-Oszillatoren,"High-power laser sources have essential applications in the fields of industry and research. However, the spectral gain of the active medium often limits the output power of highly demanded laser sources at uncommon wavelengths. Driven by higher requirements of industry and science, laser sources with process-optimized emission wavelengths represent a key technology in our society. Among other systems, Raman lasers provide an excellent technology to shift and adapt the emission spectrum to the process. These are less complex than comparable systems based on other nonlinear effects such as optical parametric gain. In this work, high-performance diamond-based Raman oscillators are developed and realized in double and single resonant operation to shift the emissions spectrum into the infrared range. Furthermore, parasitic nonlinear effects are shown and a method of their suppression is presented. Two different fiber-based lasers were developed for oscillator operation, which were used as pump sources for the Raman frequency converters. Both pump Wavelength 1060 nm and 1018 nm and the corresponding Raman frequency converters were used to shift the output spectrum into the infrared range. Going beyond the state of the art, high continuous wave power of 105Wat 1234 nm and 56Wat 1178 nm were shown for the single resonant Diamond- Raman-Oscillator. Furthermore, a double resonant system was developed to shift the emission spectrum even further into the infrared range to 1477 nm. The Raman oscillators have been characterized at high powers in a modulated and continuous mode operation. In particular, the transient behavior of the double-resonant oscillator was investigated.

Untersuchungen zur Machbarkeit der Kultivierung von Drosera rotundifolia für medizinale Zwecke auf wiedervernässten Hochmoorflächen in Deutschland mit besonderer Berücksichtigung der Co-Nutzung bei der Torfmooskultivierung,"['The round-leaved sundew (Drosera rotundifolia L.) is typical for nutrient-poor raised bogs and plays a special role in the ecosystem. In many European countries, this plant species is considered endangered or highly endangered. This can be attri- buted to three causes: 1) For decades the management and therewith drainage and fertilization of European peatlands have led to a significant decline of wet, oligotrophic and acidic habitats, which are favoured by Drosera species.  2) Already in the Middle Ages, Drosera species were used as medicinal plants mainly for the treatment of respirator y diseases (asthma, bronchitis, whooping cough etc.).  3) Cultivation experiments with Drosera species have been conducted since 1920. Nevertheless, no method for the large-scale cultivation of sundew has yet been realized to produce the quantities of the Drosera raw material required by the pharmaceutical industry. Therefore, large quantities of European and non-European Drosera species are still being collected in natural peatlands.

Although predictive quality is essentially based on known methods of data processing and ML, there is a need for further research to establish it. On the one hand, there is a lack of implementation-oriented and transferable approaches for the successful realization of predictive quality. On the other hand, key challenges have to be overcome, especially since the collection of representative data in manufacturing processes is costly and the processes are characterized by constant changes. This dissertation addresses these research gaps. First, a generic predictive quality process model called MERLIN is presented, which describes the necessary steps to realize a predictive quality application. Then, two simulation-to-reality transfer learning approaches are presented, which consist of using low-cost data from manufacturing simulations for training predictive quality models. Finally, a novel continual learning method called MAS-Cloning is presented to train an artificial neural network over changes in the manufacturing process. The goal of this method is to maintain predictive accuracy during model updates while improving training and data efficiency. The digitization of manufacturing processes opens up the possibility of data-driven quality predictions based on machine learning (ML), also known as predictive quality. The predictions can be used by process experts to initiate quality improvement actions in the process. Although the core concepts of predictive quality are based on well-known data processing and ML methods, further research is needed to establish them in manufacturing. On the one hand, there is a lack of transferable approaches for the successful realization of predictive quality. On the other hand, there are significant challenges to overcome, especially since the collection of representative data in manufacturing processes is costly and the processes are characterized by constant change. This thesis addresses these research gaps. First, a generic process model for predictive quality, called MERLIN, is presented that describes the steps necessary to realize a predictive quality application. The process model consists of four iterative phases: formalization (definition of the process and data scope), data preparation (collection and processing of representative manufacturing data), model building (training and validation of an operational learning model), and model usage (monitoring and model updating in case of process changes). In addition, to reduce the amount of data required to train predictive quality models, two approaches are developed to incorporate data from manufacturing simulations into model training. One is a simulation-to- reality transfer learning approach, where an artificial neural network (ANN) is first pre-trained on simulation data before being finetuned onreal manufacturing data. The second is a learning-based approach to reduce the simulation-to-reality gap of manufacturing simulations. Finally, a continual training method called MAS-Cloning is developed to efficiently train an ANN across changes in the manufacturing process. The goal of this method is to maintain prediction accuracy during model updates while improving training and data efficiency. This is achieved by combining the regularization method memory-aware synapses (MAS) with a transfer of pre-trained network weights. Overall, the thesis provides important research contributions for the realization of predictive quality in real manufacturing processes. It also provides a foundation for future research to establish predictive quality as a data-driven component of quality assurance processes",gnd:4047966-3 gnd:4193754-5 gnd:4226127-2 gnd:4047390-9 gnd:4016899-2
Formation and segregation of melts during deformation : an approach with analogue material,"Zusammenfassung: Field evidence from natural partial molten systems like migmatites indicate a close relationship between melt segregation and deformation. To study this phenomena we conducted experiments with rock analogues consisting of mixtures of LiNO3 and KNO3 as a melting component and crushed baryte featuring as a non-melting framework. Four sets of experiments with strain rates from 1x10E-5 s-1 to 5x10E-4 s-1 at melt contents between 4.4 , 8.8 , 17.7  and 26.6  have been conducted. Hot isostatically pressed cylindrical samples of 35 mm diameter and approximately 60 mm height have been sintered and uni-axially deformed at 133.5°C to axial strains of 30-50  with instantaneous record of strength. With this setup we enable an efficient voluminous melt segregation in three dimensions.The chosen material is scaled to simulate the melt movement of granitic melts with a viscosity of 3.6x10E+7 Pa s and strain rates of 1.1x10E-10 s-1 in a framework with grain sizes and melt fractions similar to those in nature. Measured strengths are 10E-3 the natural constraint strength of partially molten rocks. Longest experiment duration scale to 100 years in nature.Bulk strength decreases with low strain rate and high melt content without a rapid decrease at critical melt contents asinferred from literature (Arzi, 1978). At higher melt fractions samples started to harden which was interpreted as the effect of segregation which in turn lead to hardening of the melt depleted areas.Polished sections and statistical analysis of the spatial melt distribution and melt area proportion added to the understanding of segregational features. Efficient melt segregation is initiated at melt fraction higher than 4.3, where below this limit melt sticks in interstitial pore and can not accumulate. Lower strain rates and the development of favorable structures such as shear zone further increase the efficiency of melt segregation",gnd:4409345-7 gnd:4615591-0 gnd:4144082-1 gnd:4152371-4 gnd:4049828-1 gnd:4070262-5 gnd:4180697-9
Formation navigation and relative localisation of multi-robot systems,"...The presented method enables a group of mobile robots to start at an unknown location in an unknown environment and then to incrementally estimate their own positions and the relative locations of the other robots using only sensor information. The result is a robust, fast and precise approach, which does not need any preconditions or special assumptions about the environment. To validate the approach extensive tests with both, real and simulated, robots have been conducted. For a more specific evaluation, the Mean Localisation Error (MLE) is introduced. The conducted experiments include a comparison between the proposed Extended Kalman Filter and a standard SLAM-based approach. The developed method robustly delivered an accuracy better than 2 cm and performed at least as well as the SLAM approach. The algorithm coped with scattered groups of robots while moving on arbitrarily shaped paths. - In summary, this thesis presents novel approaches to the field of coordinated navigation in multi-robot systems. The results facilitate cooperative movements of robot groups as well as relative localisation among the group members. In addition, a solid foundation for a non-environment related metric for formation navigation is introduced.",gnd:7569134-6 gnd:4191911-7

Multi-omics based characterization of various stress responses in Bacillus subtilis,"['Bacillus subtilis, Multi-omics, SRM (single reaction monitoring), Osmostress, Zentralkohlenstoffmetabolismus, Anpassungsreaktionen, Central carbon metabolism, adaptational responses', 'The soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis is capable of surviving most of the ensuing environmental stress conditions. The dynamic nature of the soil habitat is manifested with varying amounts of nutrients, frequent flooding, drying and variation of other growth parameters like temperature, acidity, aeration etc. In order to survive in these conditions, B. subtilis has evolved to employ very complex adaptational responses. These adaptational responses are often multi-faceted; hence comprehensive understanding of the adaptational responses requires generation and integration of data on multi-omics level. Hence, multi-omics based detailed analysis was performed for the molecules involved in the central carbon metabolism (CCM) and proline biosynthesis pathway. In the current study two major stress conditions were extensively investigated: 1) energy limitation/starvation which is achieved by limiting glucose in the growth medium, 2) osmostress resulting from frequent drying out of soil which is simulated by adding 1.2 M NaCl to the growth medium. In addition to osmostress, the naturally available osmoprotectant glycine betaine (GB) was supplemented to understand the simultaneous influence of osmostress and osmoprotection on cellular physiology.

Natural product biosynthesis in the genus Herpetosiphon : a genomics and chemistry-guided evaluation,"A previous study revealed the presence of a diterpene synthase in H. aurantiacus DSM 785. Feeding experiments with isotope-labeled glucose led to the discovery of its possible metabolic product herpetopanone. In addition, chemical analysis allowed the discovery of five known products from Herpetosiphon spp. including two diketopiperazines, futalosine and its derivative, as well as N-acetyl-tryptophan. In order to increase species richness and reveal metabolic diverse of the genus Herpetosiphon, three unclassified Herpetosiphon spp. and a Herpetosiphon giganteus bacterium from DSMZ were subjected to a phylogenetic analysis. Based on phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic data it was concluded that Herpetosiphon sp. Hp g472 represents a novel species of the genus Herpetosiphon. In addition, an emended description of H. giganteus was proposed in this study. All bacteria in the genus Herpetosiphon are capable of predation. Genome mining of Herpetosiphon spp. revealed that they harbor a high number of biosynthetic gene clusters. Up to now, three new compounds were reported from the type species H. aurantiacus DSM 785, but the genomic potential for natural product biosynthesis is much larger. The phylum Chloroflexi is one of the deepest bacterial lineages and consists of species with various phenotypes and genotypes. Terpene synthases, especially phytoene synthases, are widely distributed in this phylum. In addition, Ktedonobacter racemifer from the genus Ktedonobacter has the ability to produce resistomycin analogs based on genome analysis.",gnd:4006902-3 gnd:4264758-7 gnd:4326022-6

The reaction of a hexachloroiridate in oleum led to a mixed-valence compound with a trimeric, oxo-bridged Ir-unit. Furthermore the first binary rhodium sulfate could be synthesized by a reaction of elemental Rhodium in conc. sulfuric acid. Hexachloroplatinates(IV) and a platinum(III)-sulfate were converted with different kinds of crown ethers and studied thermoanalytically.

Inscription of fiber Bragg gratings in non-photosensitive and rare-earth doped fibers applying ultrafast lasers,"Up to now, Fiber Bragg Gratings(FBG) were mainly written by absorption of an UV interference pattern inducing a periodical permanent refractive index modification in the fiber core. However, this method requires the use of photosensitive fibers and is difficult to apply for the realisation of FBGs in rare-earth-doped fibers, which is necessary for the realization of stable and robust fiber lasers. Therefore, an alternative technique allowing the flexible inscription of FBGs in fibers almost independently of their chemical composition was developed based on the non-linear absorption of femtosecond pulses to induce a refractive index change into the glass material.",gnd:4222149-3 gnd:4016498-6 gnd:4337333-1

Understanding animal movement behaviour in dynamic agricultural landscapes,"The movement of organisms has formed our planet like few other processes. Movements shape populations, communities, entire ecosystems, and guarantee fundamental ecosystem functions and services, like seed dispersal and pollination. Global, regional and local anthropogenic impacts influence animal movements across ecosystems all around the world. In particular, land-use modification, like habitat loss and fragmentation disrupt movements between habitats with profound consequences, from increased disease transmissions to reduced species richness and abundance. However, neither the influence of anthropogenic change on animal movement processes nor the resulting effects on ecosystems are well understood. Therefore, we need a coherent understanding of organismal movement processes and their underlying mechanisms to predict and prevent altered animal movements and their consequences for ecosystem functions.

Partitioning of atmospheric nitrogen under long-term reduced atmospheric deposition conditions in a Norway spruce forest ecosystem,"In the past century, anthropogenic activities have increased N input drastically to terrestrial ecosystems and influenced the global N cycle. Especially temperate forest ecosystems are affected in their productivity, species composition, soil chemistry and water quality. N input to forest ecosystems is retained in trees and soil. Excessive N is leached out or released as gases. The retention of N input in soils is mainly influenced by the stability of soil organic matter (SOM). Many forests in central Europe and North America have been subjected to N saturation, i.e. excessive N appeared as nitrate in the leachate below the rooting zone. Reduction of atmospheric N emission and consequent atmospheric N deposition is proposed to be the only practical long-term solution to improve N-saturated forest ecosystems. However, responses of N-saturated forest ecosystems to reduced atmospheric N deposition have been seldom investigated. In the present study, atmospheric deposition was manipulated through roof constructions below the canopy of a mature Norway spruce forest on the Solling plateau in central Germany. A £^(5)N tracer field and a density fractionation laboratory experiment were conducted in the present study to investigate the influence of long-term reduced atmospheric N deposition on the partitioning of atmospheric N in different forest ecosystem compartments as well as on the partitioning of atmospheric N retained in the soil in different SOM pools.",gnd:4282537-4 gnd:4183276-0
"Polynomial supertree methods in phylogenomics : algorithms, simulations and software","One of the objectives in modern biology, especially phylogenetics, is to build larger clades of the Tree of Life. Large-scale phylogenetic analysis involves several serious challenges. The aim of this thesis is to contribute to some of the open problems in this context. In computational phylogenetics, supertree methods provide a way to reconstruct larger clades of the Tree of Life. We present a novel polynomial time approach for the computation of supertrees called FlipCut supertree. Our method combines the computation of minimum cuts from graph-based methods with a matrix representation method, namely Minimum Flip Supertrees. Here, the input trees are encoded in a 0/1/?-matrix. We present a heuristic to search for a minimum set of 0/1-flips such that the resulting matrix admits a directed perfect phylogeny. In contrast to other polynomial time approaches, our results can be interpreted in the sense that we try to minimize a global objective function, namely the number of flips in the input matrix. We extend our approach by using edge weights to weight the columns of the 0/1/?-matrix. In order to compare our new FlipCut supertree method with other recent polynomial supertree methods and matrix representation methods, we present a large scale simulation study using two different data sets. Our findings illustrate the trade-off between accuracy and running time in supertree construction, as well as the pros and cons of different supertree approaches. Furthermore, we present EPoS, a modular software framework for phylogenetic analysis and visualization. It fills the gap between command line-based algorithmic packages and visual tools without sufficient support for computational methods. By combining a powerful graphical user interface with a plugin system that allows simple integration of new algorithms, visualizations and data structures, we created a framework that is easy to use, to extend and that covers all important steps of a phylogenetic analysis.",gnd:4611085-9 gnd:4174591-7
Applications of hyper-spectral and radar remote sensing analysis : a case study of forest landscapes in Costa Rica,"The main objective this research was to assess two types of emerging remote sensing technology, hyper-spectral and SAR sensors, for an exploratory data analysis of land covers in the south of Costa Rica. Hyper-spectral data contain information in several narrow spectral bands in the optical domain, which give information on the biochemical and structural properties of vegetation, while the SAR data, as an active system, can penetrate the clouds making it a promising tool for ecosystem monitoring. The main hypothesis was that these two datasets would permit greater understanding of the spectral confusion between different land covers. From the hyper-spectral point of view, this knowledge could help to select and derive spectral signatures which serve as training data sets in supervised species classification in the optical domain. In the microwave domain, fusion and derived bands increase the separability and permit greater forest/non-forest classification accuracy in non-flat terrains. The hyper-spectral information is based on two information sources. The first comes from two scenes of the space-borne Earth Observing-1 mission with the Hyperion sensor and two scenes of the airborne hyper-spectral sensor HyMap. The second hyper-spectral data source was acquired from the field-based hyper-spectral clip-prove system. Furthermore, the microwave information corresponds to the TerraSAR-X HH and VV polarized images ...",gnd:4016796-3 gnd:4315379-3

The gamma rays show a good spatial correspondence with the interstellar gas, which for the first time provides strong evidence of the acceleration of cosmic ray protons. Additionally, the author determines that an interaction between the supernova shockwaves and interstellar gas, referred to as “shock-cloud interaction,” promotes the efficient acceleration of cosmic ray electrons in the supernova remnant.

Synthetic and mechanistic studies of polyazole Cyclopeptide natural products : Aurantizolicin and Urukthapelstatin A,"This PhD thesis describes the development of an effective total synthesis of the strongly cytotoxic polyazole cyclopeptide natural product aurantizolicin. The synthesis design combined building block synthesis in solution with solid-phase peptide synthesis to enable the rapid diversification of the natural product. Macrothiolactonization and aza-Wittig chemistry allowed the formation of the macrocyclically embedded thiazole. Thereby, the stereochemical assignment of the natural product and the formation of an extensive library of analogs have been achieved. Profiling the analog library for its growth inhibitory effect on human cancer cells revealed crucial structural features and significantly expanded the knowledge of the structure–activity relationships (SAR) of this natural product class. Based on the SAR, chemical probes have been designed and synthesized to enable further investigations towards the elucidation of the mechanism of action of aurantizolicin. These probes included cyclopeptide–dye conjugates, compounds for photoaffinity labeling, and immobilized cyclopeptides. Initial investigations utilizing the immobilized cyclopeptides in compound-centric chemical proteomics experiments suggested an RNA-associated mechanism of action. Beyond natural product chemistry, 5-sulfamoyloxy-oxazoles have been developed as competent C–O electrophiles for Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reactions as well as for aromatic nucleophilic substitutions/conjugate additions of various heteroatom nucleophiles. The reactivity of peptide-integrated oxazolyl-sulfamates has been profiled to allow the divergent synthesis of oxazolyl-arenes, 5-amino-oxazoles, oxazolyl-sulfides, and oxazolyl-aryl ethers.

Specific affect regulation impairments in major depression,"Impairments in affect regulation as well as cognitive reactivity have been considered to play important roles in the development, maintenance, and recurrence of major depressive disorder (MDD). However, there is a lack of studies investigating, (a) whether certain difficulties in emotion regulation are specific for MDD, (b) whether certain meta-mood beliefs are associated with an increased risk for MDD, and (c) whether reduced abilities to engage in mood-incongruent information processing and to disengage from negative information are associated with depression vulnerability, and whether those specific mood regulation processes underlie the mechanism of cognitive reactivity. Therefore, Study 1 of this dissertation compared patients with MDD with a clinical and a healthy control group regarding a comprehensive set of central and clinically relevant emotion regulation difficulties. Study 2 investigated two specific kinds of meta-mood beliefs [i.e., generalized negative mood regulation (NMR) expectancies and a generalized motive to avoid emotional experience (EA)] in formerly-depressed and never-depressed subjects. Finally, Study 3 tested whether two specific mood regulation processes (i.e., mood-incongruent information processing and disengagement from negative information) differentially appear in vulnerable and non-vulnerable individuals, and whether they can account for differences in cognitive reactivity. Patients with MDD reported greater emotion regulation difficulties than healthy controls and did not differ from the clinical control group regarding difficulties with the experience and differentiation of emotions, however, patients with MDD reported greater difficulties than clinical controls regarding the attenuation and modulation of emotions (Study 1). As expected, vulnerable individuals reported lower NMR expectancies and stronger EA as compared to non-vulnerable individuals, and NMR expectancies were furthermore found to be inversely associated with EA (Study 2). In the second but not in the first phase of an autobiographical memory task, vulnerable subjects retrieved fewer mood-incongruent (positively toned) emotion words than non-vulnerable subjects (Study 3). Furthermore, vulnerable subjects with a high cognitive reactivity retrieved more negatively toned emotion words. For non-vulnerable subjects a different pattern occurred: Subjects with a high cognitive reactivity retrieved less positively toned emotion words. The findings of the three studies suggest that emotion regulation difficulties constitute transdiagnostic phenomena, and that MDD may be characterized by particularly broad and pronounced deficits in this domain. The results also suggest that maladaptive meta-mood beliefs are associated with depression vulnerability and that individuals with low confidence in their negative mood regulation abilities are concurrently characterized by a stronger avoidance of emotional experience. Furthermore, the results suggest that a reduced ability of mood-incongruent information processing is associated with depression vulnerability, and that two different memory processes of mood regulation may account for cognitive reactivity in individuals who are at high versus low risk for depression. The cross-sectional designs and the use of self-report measures as well as the relatively small sample sizes in two of the studies limit the interpretation of the obtained results. Notwithstanding, the findings of these three studies call for an implementation of specific elements that foster adaptive affect regulation (e.g., computer-assisted training of cognitive processes) into existing treatment packages for MDD.",gnd:4049075-0 gnd:4135470-9 gnd:4011474-0

Phase retrieval problems in x-ray physics: from modeling to efficient algorithms,"In phase retrieval problems that occur in imaging by coherent x-ray diffraction, one tries to reconstruct information about a sample of interest from possibly noisy intensity measurements of the wave fi eld traversing the sample. The mathematical formulation of these problems bases on some assumptions. Usually one of them is that the x-ray wave fi eld is generated by a point source. In order to address this very idealized assumption, it is common to perform a data preprocessing step, the so-called empty beam correction. Within this work, we study the validity of this approach by presenting a quantitative error estimate. Moreover, in order to solve these phase retrieval problems, we want to incorporate a priori knowledge about the structure of the noise and the solution into the reconstruction process. For this reason, the application of a problem adapted iteratively regularized Newton-type method becomes particularly attractive. This method includes the solution of a convex minimization problem in each iteration step. We present a method for solving general optimization problems of this form. Our method is a generalization of a commonly used algorithm which makes it efficiently applicable to a wide class of problems. We also proof convergence results and show the performance of our method by numerical examples.",gnd:4178306-2 gnd:4006617-4 gnd:4503793-0 gnd:4114251-2
"Kastrationsfolgen beim Hund in Abhängigkeit von Alter, Größe, Gewicht und Rasse","['The aim of the following thesis was to examine the effects of neutering dogs like urinary incontinence, hypothyroidism and orthopedic problems depending of their age, size, body weight and breed. For this purpose, 6686 questions have been evaluated. The data of 3497 female and 3189 male dogs have been analyzed. 56,1 percent of the bitches and 43,9 percent of the males were castrated. The dogs belonged to 205 different breeds. There has been a connection between the occurrence of urinary incontinence and the reproduction status, the size, the body weight and the breed of the dogs. There was no relationship between the occurrence of urinary incontinence and the early or late neutering in bitches and male dogs. In 11,2 percent of the spayed bitches and 4,7 percent of the castrated males occurred urinary incontinence. 245 of the female dogs with urinary incontinence, 93 percent were spayed and 7 percent intact. The neutered female dogs had a 9,7 times higher risk and the male dogs a 1,7 higher risk to suffer from urinary incontinence than intact dogs. 20,0 percent of the male dogs which had been castrated late, at an age over eight years suffered from urinary incontinence. In female dogs of a shoulder height of over 40 centimeters there had a 12,6 percent higher risk to suffer from urinary incontinence than in spayed bitches of a shoulder height of under 40 centimeters with only 5,4 percent of incidences of urinary incontinence. The risk of urinary incontinence in spayed female dogs increases with increasing seize of the dogs. Spayed female dogs of over 60 centimeters shoulder height suffered 9,8 more often from urinary incontinence than not spayed female dogs of the same height. Spayed female dogs with a weight of over 20 kilograms suffered 16 times more of urinary incontinence (14,4 percent) than not spayed females with 0,9 percent and a weight of over 20 kilograms. In the weight range “20 to 30 kilograms body weight” even 23,6 times as much spayed female dogs suffered from urinary incontinence than intact ones. Certain breed dispositions for urinary incontinence can be identified in spayed female dogs for the breeds Bull Terrier, Giant schnauzer and the Dogue de Bordeaux and for the breed groups pinscher and Schnauzer (25,9 percent), pointing dogs (19,2 percent) and Molossoid breeds (15,6 percent). For the evaluation of hypothyroidism as a side effect of neutering, 324 dogs were found who suffered from it. There has been a connection between the occurrence of hypothyroidism and the reproduction status, the age, the size, the body weight and the breed of the dogs. Castrated male dogs were 7,7 percent more often affected by the disease than spayed bitches with 5,5 percent. In every range of age, neutered male dogs and female dogs were more often affected by hypothyroidism than intact ones, except the group of males of the age between 9 and 12 years. The risk of hypothyroidism increased in bitches and male dogs with increasing age, size and body weight. A breed predisposition can be identified for the Rhodesian Ridgeback (21,8 percent), the Magyar Vizsla (16,6 percent) and the Dobermann (12,2 percent). For the evaluation of the orthopedic problems as the secondary effect of neutering, 1209 dogs were found who suffered from it. There has been a connection between the occurrence of orthopedic problems depending of the reproduction status and the breed of the dogs. The neutered female dogs hat a 3,0 times higher risk and the male dogs a 1,8 higher risk to suffer than intact dogs. Breed predispositions can be recognized in spayed bitches for the Swiss Mountain/Cattle Dogs (43,2 percent), for the Molossoid (38,3 percent) as well as for crossbreeds (31,2 percent) with a body weight above 20 kilograms. The recommendation can be made to castrate the male dog shortly after puberty, if a medical indication exists, because the risk of urinary incontinence increases to 20 percent for the late neutered dogs with increasing age. In view of the present results there can be made no recommendation for neutering of Giant Schnauzer, because 45,0 percent of the female dogs and 28,6 percent of the males of all neutered animals suffered from urinary incontinence. Summarizing the above, it can be stated that during the consultation the owner of the dog should be fully informed about possible unwanted side effects of the neutering. Advantages and disadvantages should be discussed and the reason for the neutering should be identified. The breed, the sex, the age and the body weight of the dog have to be taken into account. It remains a decision for the individual animal. Possible alternatives like the chemical castration via an injectable hormone implant (Suprelorin®) should as well be considered in case of neutering a male dog.', 'Ziel der vorliegenden Arbeit war es, die Kastrationsfolgen Harninkontinenz, Hypothyreose und Probleme mit dem Bewegungsapparat beim Hund in Abhängigkeit von Alter, Größe, Gewicht und Rasse zu untersuchen. Dazu wurden 6686 Fragebogen ausgewertet. Es wurden Daten von 3497 Hündinnen und 3189 Rüden analysiert. 56,1% der Hündinnen und 43,9 % der Rüden waren kastriert. Die Hunde gehörten 205 verschiedenen Rassen an. Es bestanden Zusammenhänge zwischen dem Auftreten von Harninkontinenz und dem Reproduktionsstatus, der Größe, dem Gewicht und Rasse der Hunde. Es bestand kein Zusammenhang zwischen dem Auftreten von Harninkontinenz und einer Früh- oder Spätkastration bei Hündinnen und Rüden. Bei 11,2 % der kastrierten Hündinnen und 4,7 % der kastrierten Rüden trat Harninkontinenz auf. Von den 245 inkontinenten Hündinnen waren 93 % kastriert und 7 % intakt. Kastrierte Hündinnen hatten ein 9,7-fach und kastrierte Rüden ein 1,7-fach erhöhtes Risiko an Harninkontinenz zu erkranken als intakte Hunde. Rüden welche mit über acht Jahren spätkastriert wurden, zeigten zu 20,0 % Harnträufeln. Hündinnen über 40 cm Schulterhöhe hatten mit 12,6 % Erkrankungen ein 2,3-fach höheres Risiko, an Harninkontinenz zu erkranken als kastrierte Hündinnen unter 40 cm Schulterhöhe mit nur 5,4 % Erkrankungsfällen. Das Risiko für kastrierte Hündinnen an Harninkontinenz zu erkranken, stieg mit zunehmender Größe an. Kastrierte Hündinnen über 60 cm Schulterhöhe waren 9,8-mal häufiger erkrankt als intakte Hündinnen derselben Größenklasse. Kastrierte Hündinnen über 20 Kilogramm Körpergewicht waren mit 14,4 % 16-mal häufiger erkrankt als intakte Hündinnen mit 0,9 % und einem Körpergewicht über 20 Kilogramm. In der Gewichtsklasse „20 bis 30 Kilogramm Körpergewicht“ waren sogar 23,6-mal so viele kastrierte Hündinnen an Harninkontinenz erkrankt als intakte. Rassedispositionen für Harninkontinenz lassen sich bei den kastrierten Hündinnen für die Einzelrassen Bull Terrier, Riesenschnauzer und Bordeauxdogge aussprechen und für die Rassegruppen der Pinscher und Schnauzer (25,9 %), Vorstehhunde (19,2 %) und Molosser (15,6 %). In die Auswertung der Kastrationsnebenwirkung Hypothyreose gingen 324 erkrankte Hunde ein. Es bestanden Zusammenhänge zwischen dem Auftreten von Hypothyreose und dem Reproduktionsstatus, dem Alter, der Größe, dem Gewicht und Rasse der Hunde. Kastrierte Rüden waren mit 7,7 % häufiger als kastrierte Hündinnen mit 5,5 % Erkrankungsfällen betroffen. Kastrierte Rüden und Hündinnen erkrankten in jeder Altersklasse häufiger an Hypothyreose als intakte, mit Ausnahme der Gruppe der „9 bis 12-jährigen Rüden“. Das Risiko für Hypothyreose stieg bei Hündinnen und Rüden mit zunehmender Alter, Größe und Gewicht an. Rassedispositionen können für den Rhodesian-Ridgeback (21,8 %), Magyar Vizsla (16,6 %) und Dobermann (12,2 %) ausgesprochen werden. Für die Auswertung der Kastrationsnebenwirkung ""Probleme mit dem Bewegungsapparat“ gingen 1209 erkrankte Hunde ein. Es bestanden Zusammenhänge zwischen dem Auftreten von Problemen mit dem Bewegungsapparat in Abhängigkeit vom Reproduktionsstatus und der Rasse der Hunde. Kastrierte Hündinnen hatten ein 3,0-fach und kastrierte Rüden ein 1,8-fach erhöhtes Risiko zu erkranken als intakte Hunde. Rassedispositionen lassen sich bei kastrierten Hündinnen für die Rassegruppe der Sennen- und Treibhunde (43,2 %), Molosser (38,3 %), sowie Mischlinge mit einem Körpergewicht über 20 Kilogramm (31,2 %) feststellen. Es kann die Empfehlung ausgesprochen werden, Rüden möglichst frühzeitig nach der Pubertät kastrieren zu lassen, wenn eine medizinische Indikation vorliegt, da das Risiko der Spätkastrierten mit zunehmendem Alter für Harninkontinenz bis auf 20 % ansteigt. Im Hinblick auf die vorliegenden Ergebnisse kann keine Empfehlung der Kastration von Riesenschnauzern ausgesprochen werden, da die Hündinnen mit 45,0 % und Rüden mit 28,6 % aller kastrierten Tiere von Harninkontinenz betroffen waren. Das Risiko für die Kastrationsfolgen Harninkontinenz, Hypothyreose und Probleme mit dem Bewegungsapparat war bei kastrierten Hunden im Gegensatz zu intakten erhöht und stieg mit zunehmendem Gewicht, Größe und Alter der Hunde an. Zusammenfassend bleibt festzustellen, dass bei der Kastrationsberatung für seinen Hund der Besitzer umfassend über mögliche unerwünschte Nebenwirkungen aufgeklärt werden muss. Vor- und Nachteile sollten besprochen werden und der Grund für die Kastration herausgearbeitet werden. Die Rasse, das Geschlecht, das Alter und das Gewicht des Hundes müssen Berücksichtigung finden. Es bleibt eine Einzeltierentscheidung. Ebenso sollte bei Rüden über die mögliche Alternative der medikamentellen Kastration mittels Suprelorin® Implantat nachgedacht werden.']",gnd:4029906-5 gnd:4026181-5 gnd:4317914-9
"Isolation, structure elucidation and characterization of bacterial siderophores","In this thesis a genome mining approach including bioinformatic predictions of natural product biosynthesis gene clusters was used to detect and isolate putative siderophores (small molecule iron transporters) from underexplored ß-proteobacteria.

Namely, in the first part a general aggregation dynamics model is formulated, and used to show that fragmentation crucially affects the efficiency of the self-assembly process of proteins. In the second part, by mapping the membrane-mediated forces into a simplified many-body system, the dynamic and equilibrium behaviour of interacting mechanosensitive channels is derived, showing that protein agglomeration strongly impacts its desired function.

Modern constraint answer set solving,"Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a declarative problem solving approach, combining a rich yet simple modeling language with high-performance solving capabilities. Although this has already resulted in various applications, certain aspects of such applications are more naturally modeled using variables over finite domains, for accounting for resources, fine timings, coordinates, or functions. Our goal is thus to extend ASP with constraints over integers while preserving its declarative nature. This allows for fast prototyping and elaboration tolerant problem descriptions of resource related applications. The resulting paradigm is called Constraint Answer Set Programming (CASP). We present three different approaches for solving CASP problems. The first one, a lazy, modular approach combines an ASP solver with an external system for handling constraints. This approach has the advantage that two state of the art technologies work hand in hand to solve the problem, each concentrating on its part of the problem.

Practicing the Correspondence Principle in the Old Quantum Theory : a Transformation through Implementation,"['This book presents a history of the correspondence principle from a new perspective. The author provides a unique exploration of the relation between the practice of theory and conceptual development in physics. In the process, he argues for a new understanding of the history of the old quantum theory and the emergence of quantum mechanics. The analysis looks at how the correspondence principle was disseminated and how the principle was applied as a research tool during the 1920s. It provides new insights into the interaction between theoretical tools and scientific problems and shows that the use of this theoretical tool changed the tool itself in a process of transformation through implementation. This process, the author claims, was responsible for the conceptual development of the correspondence principle. This monograph connects to the vast literature in the history of science, which analyzed theoretical practices as based on tacit knowledge, skills, and calculation techniques. It contributes to the historical understanding of quantum physics and the emergence of quantum mechanics. Studying how physicists used a set of tools to solve problems, the author spells out the ‟skillful guessing” that went into the making of quantum theoretical arguments and argues that the integration and implementation of technical resources was a central driving force for the conceptual and theoretical transformation in the old quantum theory', '1.

On the interplay of spin dynamics and chemical kinetics in the nuclear spin hyperpolarization technique signal amplification by reversible exchange (SABRE) : a simulation and experimental NMR study,"Abstract: In this thesis, The nuclear hyperpolarization technique ""Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange (SABRE)"" is studied. SABRE utilizes externally supplied parahydrogen (pH2) to generate hyperpolarized molecules in a transient, SABRE active organometallic complex which can result in several orders of magnitude enhanced NMR signals of the target molecules. The main focus of this work is the interplay of chemical kinetics and spin dynamics in these complexes and their effect on the SABRE hyperpolarization process at high magnetic fields. For this purpose, a theoretical model was developed and implemented which is presented in chapter 4. In contrast to previous approaches, this model explicitly takes into account both spin dynamics and chemical exchange. Subsequently, the model was used to analyze several aspects of SABRE hyperpolarization. In chapter 5, the dependence of the ’classical’ SABRE scheme, generating hyperpolarization at low magnetic fields, on coherent and incoherent parameters of the spin system (e.g. J-couplings and relaxation rates) as well as exchange rates is analyzed. Chapter 6 presents a study of the evolution of spin state of freely dissolved parahydrogen in the SABRE system. This study revealed that pH2 suffers an unexpected loss of coherence. Upon further investigation, it was found that two low concentrated, intermediate catalytic complexes exist in the SABRE system studied here which are the source of the coherence loss. This hypothesis was substantiated by theoretical modelling of the obtained data and by experiments where these intermediates wereselectively isolated and studied. In Chapter 7, the previously unexplained phenomena of spontaneous formation of hyperpolarized molecules at high magnetic fields (here meaning > 1 Tesla) is analyzed and a pathway for the formation proposed which is supported by experiments and theoretical calculations. The last two chapters of this work are dedicated to the analysis of high field hyperpolarization transfer schemes for SABRE. In chapter 8, a previously proposed scheme based on continuous radio-frequency irradiation (RF) is studied with regards to the influence of ongoing exchange and loss of coherences of freely dissolved pH2.

Protective and adjuvant environments in the context of allergic diseases : a study on the role of small organic compounds,"Studies demonstrated a low prevalence of allergy and asthma among farmer children compared to non-farmer children. We targeted small respirable compounds in the gas and particulate phase of distinct farming aerosols to gain first insights of a potential allergy-protective effect of such small organic compounds. Specific differences between a potential protective (cow shed) and non-protective (sheep shed) environment were identified and biologically tested.

Anwendungseigenschaften glaskeramik-basierter Lithiumionenleiter,"Festkörperbatterien mit nicht-entflammbaren Festkörperelektrolyten sind eine mögliche Lösung, die Risiken von derzeitigen Lithiumionenbatterien zu überwinden. Im Rahmen dieser Promotion werden die Anwendungseigenschaften von zwei vielversprechenden Festkörperelektrolyten, Lithium-Lanthan-Zirkonium-Oxid (LLZO) und Lithium-Aluminium-Titan-Phosphat (LATP) untersucht. Die SCHOTT AG kann diese über einen skalierbaren Schmelzprozess als glaskeramische Pulver herstellen. Die einzigartige amorphe Phase (φa) dieser Pulver wurde entwickelt, um mehrere Herausforderungen rein keramischer Festkörperelektrolyte zu meistern. Im ersten Teil der Arbeit werden die Bulk- und Oberflächeneigenschaften von mehreren LLZO- und LATP-Pulvern mit unterschiedlichen Anteilen an φa studiert. XRD-Messungen zeigten, dass für die LLZO-Pulver die gezielte Auswahl des Anteils von φa wichtig ist, um schlecht-leitfähige Nebenphasen zu vermeiden. Im Gegensatz dazu kann φa bei LATP variiert werden, ohne dass die hoch-leitfähige kristalline Phase beeinflusst wird. Desweiteren wurde nachgewiesen, dass die Kontamination mit kritischen Oberflächenverunreinigungen, wie H2O und CO2, vergleichbar oder kleiner ist als für typische aus der Literatur bekannte Pulver, welche auf Laborskala hergestellt worden sind. Dennoch ist die Reaktionsgeschwindigkeit mit diesen Gasen sehr schnell, sodass die Prozessierung unter inerten Bedingungen (Taupunkt <= -55 ºC) empfohlen wird. Im zweiten Teil der Arbeit wurde ein Sinterprozess für LLZO und LATP entwickelt und optimiert. Die besten Proben erreichen eine relative Dichte von bis zu 100 % und eine sehr hohe Leitfähigkeit im Bereich von ~ 10-3 S/cm. Sowohl die Sintertemperatur als auch Zeit konnten im Vergleich zu klassischen Sinterrouten für kristalline Elektrolyte reduziert werden. Insbesondere LATP kann bereits ab 750 ºC gesintert werden, ohne dass die Leitfähigkeit und Dichte reduziert werden. Folglich übertrifft das glaskeramische LATP die Eigenschaften aller derzeit bekannter kristalliner LATP-Pulver aus der Literatur. Dies wurde zusätzlich durch eine Messung der auÿerordentlich hohen Kornleitfähigkeit von 6 · 10-3 S/cm im GHz-Bereich demonstriert, welche mit dem Wert für ideale Einkristalle übereinstimmt. Im dritten Teil der Arbeit wurde die Kombination von glaskeramischen LLZO/LATP mit einem flexiblen Polymerelektrolyten, Polyethylenoxid (PEO) mit Li-N(SO2CF3)2 (LiTFSI), untersucht. Auf makroskopischer Skala konnte kein nennenswerter Grenzflächenwiderstand zwischen PEO-LiTFSI und gesinterten Tabletten aus LLZO/LATP detektiert werden. Dennoch führte ein einfaches Mischen der anorganischen Pulver mit PEO-LiTFSI zu einer reduzierten Leitfähigkeit dieser Hybridelektrolyte. Mittels Rasterelektronenmikroskopie konnte die Reduktion der Leitfähigkeit mit der Anwesenheit von isolierenden Löchern und Partikelagglomeraten korreliert werden. Mittels eines nachfolgenden Knetprozesses wurden homogene Hybridelektrolyte hergestellt, welche eine erhöhte Leitfähigkeit verglichen mit dem reinen PEO-LiTFSI Elektrolyt aufweisen. Die Resultate dieser Arbeit zeigen, dass die glaskeramischen Elektrolyte vielversprechende Kandidaten für eine gesinterte und auch für eine polymer-basierte Festkörperbatterie sind. ; All-solid-state batteries with non-flammable solid electrolytes are one possible solution to overcome the risks of state-of-the-art lithium ion batteries. In the framework of this dissertation the application properties of two promising solid electrolytes, Lithium-lanthanum-zirconium-oxide (LLZO) and Lithium-aluminium-titan-phosphate (LATP) were investigated. The SCHOTT AG is able to produce these electrolytes with a scalable process as glass-ceramic powders. The unique amorphous phase (φa) of these powders is intended to overcome several challenges of pure ceramic solid electrolytes. In the first part of this thesis the bulk and surface properties of several glass-ceramic LLZO and LATP powders with different content of φa were studied. X-ray-diffraction measurements revealed that for the LLZO powders the right choice of the amount of φa is important to avoid secondary phases with low conductivity. In contrast φa of LATP could be varied without any influence on the highly conductive crystalline phase. Furthermore, it was proven that the contamination with detrimental surface impurities like H2O or CO2 is equal or less compared to typical powders from literature, which were produced at lab-sale. However, it was found that the reaction with these gases is still very fast, which means processing under inert conditions (dew point <= -55 °C) is recommended. In the second part of this thesis a sintering process for LLZO and LATP was developed and optimized. For the best samples, a relative density up to 100 % and a very high conductivity of ~10-3 S/cm could be achieved. Both sintering temperature and time could be reduced compared to classical sintering routes for the ceramic electrolytes. Especially, LATP could be sintered at 750 °C without decreasing conductivity and density. Thus, the glass-ceramic LATP powder outperforms every known pure ceramic LATP reported so far. This was further demonstrated by measuring the exceptionally high grain-core conductivity of 6 · 10-3 S/cm in the GHz-regime, that corresponds very well to the value of ideal LATP single-crystals. In the third part of this thesis the combination of glass-ceramic LLZO/LATP with a flexible polymer electrolyte, Polyethylenoxide (PEO) with Li-N(SO2CF3)2 (LiTFSI), was investigated. On a macroscopic scale no significant interface resistance between PEOLiTFSI and sintered discs of LLZO/LATP could be detected. However, a simple mixing process of the inorganic powders with PEO-LiTFSI resulted in a decreased conductivity of these hybrid-electrolytes. Via scanning electron microscopy the decrease in conductivity could be correlated to the imperfect microstructure consisting of insulating voids and particle agglomerates. With a further kneading process homogenous hybrid electrolytes were obtained, which revealed an increased conductivity compared to the pure PEO-LiTFSI electrolyte. The results of this dissertation indicate that the glass-ceramic electrolytes are promising candidates for both a sintered and a polymer-based all-solid-state battery.",gnd:4154168-6 gnd:1222782014
Aerosols and boundary layer structure over Arctic sea ice based on airborne lidar and dropsonde measurements,"The atmosphere over the Arctic Ocean is strongly influenced by the distribution of sea ice and open water. Leads in the sea ice produce strong convective fluxes of sensible and latent heat and release aerosol particles into the atmosphere. They increase the occurrence of clouds and modify the structure and characteristics of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) and thereby influence the Arctic climate.

Processes of magmatic and tectonic accretion of oceanic lithosphere at mid-ocean ridges : constraints from a seismic refraction study at he Mid-Atlantic Ridge near 21.5° N,"Mid-oceanic ridges are plate boundaries where new oceanic crust is created. Especially slow-spreading ridges, like the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR), reveal a complex structure denoted by magmatic and tectonic processes. In the working area of this seismic refractions study both types of crustal accretion are present. The northern segment (22.2ʿ N) compensates tectonically the tensional stresses caused by the plate tectonic movements of the African and the Northern American plates. So called detachment faults or oceanic core complexes (OCCs) develop during that tectonic phase. In the meantime the southern segment (21.5ʿ N) is a magmatically robust segment. The peculiarity of this segment is that it growths south- and northwards along the ridge axis, starting at about 5 m.y. ago. Ridge propagation was strong enough to break through a stable small offset transform fault. During propagation the transform migrated southwards, leaving behind a V-shaped structure the so called inner and outer pseudofaults. From five seismic refraction and wide-angle profiles, ridge-parallel and ridge-crossing, the seismic velocity structure was observed. The results show a strong crustal variation. The ridge-crossing profiles illustrate the temporal evolution of the crustal accretion within the magmatic robust segment. Past magmatic activities can be reconstructed. The different morphological and geological features of the area required different inversion and modelling procedures. A broad variety of methods for interpretation of the collected geophysical data were applied to gain a subsurface image and to allow a geological reconstruction ...",gnd:4261537-9 gnd:4139001-5

Thermokarst dynamics in central-eastern Beringia : insights from permafrost and lacustrine sediment cores,"Widespread landscape changes are presently observed in the Arctic and are most likely to accelerate in the future, in particular in permafrost regions which are sensitive to climate warming.

Causes and interactions of environmental variability can hardly be resolved by instrumental records covering modern time scales. However, long-term environmental variability is recorded in paleoenvironmental archives.

Socio-economic vulnerability to climate change : a regional assessment in the context of water stress and tourism development in north-eastern Morocco,"['Water resources in north-eastern Morocco are increasingly under pressure from a growing human demand and a regional drying trend caused by changing climate patterns. Recently, water resources have reached or already fallen below critical limits. The human exploitation of water resources represents the main reason for an alarming decrease of freshwater resources: caused by population growth, high agricultural irrigation water needs, and the recent implementation of a water-intense tourism sector. The lack of appropriate policies to respond to these challenges determines regional vulnerability und puts socio-economic development at risk. The overarching research objective of this thesis is the identification of human and climateinduced rivers for increasing water stress in north-eastern Morocco with a focus on regional tourism development. With particular regard to climate change and to the water-intense regional development plans, it is necessary to analyse how this will influence the near-term water situation and water demand, respectively. The key economic sectors with the highest share of working population are highly waterdependent,thus sufficient water availability represents the basis for socio-economic development.

Molecular Characterisation of Feline Mammary Tumours,"FMCs are highly malignant tumours characterised by local invasion and early dissemination. Considering the poor outcome of affected cats, identification of useful biomarkers to predict clinical behaviour and suitable therapeutic targets is of major importance. In this study, we used massive-parallel DNA and RNA sequencing to identify structural rearrangements and differentially expressed genes enriching key biological processes characterising FMC-associated malignancy and poor outcome. Important structural rearrangements (CNLs in FCA B1 and CNGs in FCAs B4 and F2) were detected and correlated with poor prognosis. Immunohistochemical and transcriptomic findings showed a high level of correlation with genomic aberrations detected. Different potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets were identified including TUSC3, RRM2, ESRP1, HMGA2 and MYC as well as different components of the p53 and PI3K-Akt signalling pathways. Amplified and upregulated genes were typically involved in pathways correlated with cell motion (SBDS, ITGAM, PDGFA, RAC1, FGFR1, APC and ITGB2), transcription modulation (GATA3, HMGN1, ZEB1, MYC and MYCN), DNA replication and repairing (RFC3, AK2, NUDT5. MCM2, RRM2 and TYMS) and EMT-elicitation (VIM, ZEB1, KRAS, HMGA2, ESRP1, MTDH, YWHAZ, and MYC). On the other hand, deleted and down-regulated genes were typically tumour-suppressors (CSMD1, MSR1, MTUS1, TUSC3, DLC1, NRG1 and LZTS1) or genes involved in biological processes that would normally prevent tumour spreading such as tight junction components (CLDN4, CLDN5 CLDN7, CLDN8, CLDN23, LMO7, PCDH17, PCDH20 and PCDH9) and cell adhesion molecules (CD2, CD8A, CD34, CD40, CDH1, CDH4, CDH5, ICAM2, ITGAM, ITGB2, PECAM1, ESAM and JAM2). FMCs included in this study shared some clinical and molecular similarities with specific molecular subtypes of human breast cancer characterised by worse outcome (i.e. hTNBCs, metaplastic breast carcinomas, and claudin-low breast tumours). Cellular models analysed shared a considerable amount of similarities with original tumours; however, specific alterations mainly correlated with endocrine regulation, circadian rhythm and metabolic pathways showed important differences. Despite the genomic characteristics associated with poor prognosis in solid carcinomas, no separation for the different histological grouping (tubular carcinomas, comedocarcinomas and solid carcinomas) was observed at the transcriptomic level. Molecular characteristics associated with malignancy were more typically observed in solid carcinomas and comedocarcinomas. However, specific cases with tubular carcinomas also shared these molecular characteristics and had a poor survival.

High power ultra-short pulse lasers based on fiber driven OPCPA,"Ultrashort laser pulses enable fundamental studies on small length and time scales. Additionally, high pulse energies allows the access to new regimes of light matter interaction and the investigation of nanometer scale structures on attosecond time scales by XUV pulses produced via high harmonic generation (HHG). Unfortunately, the XUV photon flux is typically very low. Hence, high power and high repetition rate driving laser sources are required in order to improve the performance of current studies and to open the way for new exiting applications, such as seeding of free electron lasers. Regrettably, conventional (Ti:Sa) laser technology is limited in output power due to the thermo optical effects in the amplifier crystals. The objective of this thesis is the development of a new power scalable laser concept merging OPCPA technology with state-of-the-art high power fiber lasers. Based on modeling of the optical parametric amplifier, important requirements on the OPCPA pump are found which are adopted in choice and development of the pump laser later. Furthermore, the geometry of the optical parametric amplifier is optimized for ultra-broadband amplification. Gain narrowing and saturation effects are investigated in order to achieve high conversion efficiency. In addition, parasitic nonlinear effects, such as second harmonic generation of signal and idler wave, are studied and configurations are found which effectively avoid these unwanted effects.",gnd:4264163-9 gnd:4260327-4 gnd:4222149-3
Impacts of climate change on hydrodynamic conditions and salinity of the Weser estuary,"[""Coasts and estuaries are especially impacted by the anthropogenic climate change, as they are not solely influenced by changes in atmospheric conditions, but also by a rise of mean sea level, changes in river runoff regimes and intensification of storm surges. Hence, an integral part in the investigation of climate change on estuaries is to assess impacts on adjacent systems such as coastal shelf seas and watersheds. This complicates deriving reliable projections as uncertainties from the different levels of the analysis may accumulate. In this thesis, impacts of climate change on hydrodynamic conditions and salinity of the Weser estuary, Germany, are investigated. The employed impact model is a 3D hydrodynamic estuary model which is based on a semi-implicit finite element solver. A comprehensive skill assessment shows the good ability of the developed model to reproduce the complex hydrodynamic conditions and the salt intrusion in the estuary. Uncertainty due to natural variability, model parameters and boundary conditions is evaluated and visualized. The results of the simulations are evaluated regarding changes of tidal characteristics and harmonic constituents. Changes of salinity are investigated based on instantaneous intrusion of isohalines and an empirical model to predict depth and tide averaged salinity depending on the location and the runoff. Emphasis is put on analysis of the underlying physical processes. Key results for special focus regions are presented separately for planners and decision makers. An evaluation of studies shows that climate change will impact the Weser estuary mainly by means of a mean sea level rise. A medium confidence and a high end scenario of mean sea level rise are investigated and additionally compared to two scenarios of human interventions and interactions of both. Other possible changes are either in the range of today's variability (North Sea storm surge climate, river runoff) or literature shows no agreeing projections (North Sea regional mean sea level change and tidal dynamics). The results show that the mean sea level rise leads to an increase of tidal range in the inner estuary. This is accompanied by a transition to more flood dominant current due to decreased intertidal storage volume in the outer estuary. An increase of salinity is observed."", 'Küsten und Ästuare sind vom anthropogenen Klimawandel in besonderer Weise betroffen, da nicht nur die Änderungen der atmosphärischen Randbedingungen, sondern auch der Meeresspiegelanstieg sowie Änderungen im Abflussregime oder Intensivierung des Sturmflutklimas einen Einfluss haben.

Instead of vapor pressure, the hydrophobicity or lipophilicity of the volatile organic substrate dominates the mass transfer and the sonolysis. Also, most of products stem from the pyrolysis of substrate in collapsing cavitation bubbles, and the reactivity of organic substrate with the active intermediates generated in situ during the sonication, profoundly affects the sonochemical reaction in bulk liquid.

The GABAB proteome: a differential view on GABAB1a-specific interaction partners,"Abstract: GABAB receptors are the most abundant G protein-coupled receptors in the mammalian brain that mediate important aspects of the action of GABA. They show a pronounced diversity in subcellular distribution, functional properties and cellular signaling. The heterodimeric receptor consists of GABAB1, which is responsible for agonist binding, and GABAB2, which triggers GDP/GTP exchange in a Gi/o-type G protein and therefore activates signaling. Alternative promoter usage creates two distinct GABAB1 subtypes, B1b and B1a. The latter contains two sushi-type protein domains at the extracellular N-terminus. This 160 amino acid extension drives trafficking of GABAB1a to axonal compartments, which is arguably mediated through protein-protein interactions at the sushi domains of GABAB1a.<br>In this thesis, GABAB1a-specific interactors were identified by comparing proteomic data from wild-type and GABAB1a knock-out mice with a mass spectrometric approach. For this purpose, GABAB receptors were effectively solubilized from membrane-enriched fractions of adult brain and subsequently purified with specific antibodies targeting the receptor. In addition, a method to express and purify the sushi domains as recombinant protein in mg-scale has been established. The domains were used as a bait in pull-down experiments and together with heterologous complex reconstitution verified these protein interaction strings. The approaches demonstrated unequivocally that adherence-junction associated protein-1 (AJAP1), amyloid precursor protein (APP) and PILRα-associated neural protein (PIANP) directly interact with GABAB1a-containing receptors. The dynamics of the receptor assembly was evaluated in a further step by a differential proteomic analysis. The comparison of the individual knock-outs of AJAP1 and APP with wild-type mice revealed that the GABAB1a-specific proteins split into distinct GABAB(1a/2) receptor assemblies. In contrast to AJAP1 and PIANP, APP recruits further proteins putatively responsible for the axonal transport machinery. In addition, structural analysis helped to decipher binding sites of the B1a-interactors and revealed a common WG sequence preceded by hydrophobic amino acids and followed by G/P and A/T that interacts with sushi domain 1, but not sushi domain 2, at the N-terminal end of GABAB1a.<br>Further characterization of these proteins point toward their functional relevance.

Development of whole cell-based biosensor in 3D environment for nanoparticles cytotoxicity detection,"The emergence of human-based models is incontestably required for the study of complex physiological pathways and validation of reliable in vitro methods as alternative for in vivo studies in experimental animals for toxicity assessment. With this objective, three dimensional environments for human cells were developed and tested using three different types of hydrogels including transglutaminase-crosslinked gelatin, collagen type I and growth-factor depleted Matrigel. Cells grown in Matrigel exhibited the greatest cell proliferation and spheroid diameter. Moreover, urea and albumin analysis indicated that the created system allows the immortalized liver cell line (HepG2) to re-establish normal hepatocyte-like properties which are not observed under the conditions of conventional cell cultures. This study presents a reproducible technology for production of complex-shaped liver multicellular spheroids as a system which improves the predictive value of cell-based assays for safety and risk assessment. The time- and dose-dependent toxicity of nanoparticles demonstrates higher cytotoxic effects when HepG2 cells grown as monolayer than embedded in hydrogels. The experimental setup provided evidence that cell environment has significant influence on cell sensitivity and that liver spheroids are useful and novel tools to examine NP dosing effect even at the level of in vitro studies. Moreover, the created cell-based biosensor responds optimally to bioactive analytes, has a fast response time, offers label-free experimentation and simple procedures. Besides, the developed NF-κB_HepG2 cells enable detect cytotoxicity of variety nanoparticles with different chemical composition, size, tendency of agglomeration or cytotoxic potential and other stimuli which activate NF-κB signaling (e.g. heavy metals), in very early stage, before cell death, in short time even after 2 h time exposure as opposed to widely used commercially available cell-based assays like MTT, XTT Alamar Blue or LDH. Successful modification of HepG2 cells resulted in generation of novel NF-κB_HepG2 sensor cells with extracellular reporter protein (human secreted alkaline phosphatase) and its application in cytotoxicity of nanomaterials detection has not been investigated before. The developed NF-κB_hepG2 cells may also provide a useful tool to study distinct molecular mechanisms of inflammation and cellular stress using low exposure concentrations of cell irritants. The presented sensor based on human cells in three dimensional milieu provides a novel application for nanoparticles screening that joins the complex in vitro model imitating living tissue with high throughput analytical methods. This system can be applied to a wide diversity of potentially hostile compounds in basic screening to provide initial warning of adverse effects and trigger subsequent analysis and remedial actions.",gnd:4067547-6

Analysis of the role of Heat shock factors and Mediator subunits in heat stress memory in Arabidopsis thaliana,"In nature, plants often encounter biotic and abiotic stresses, which can cause reduced crop yield and quality, and threaten the nutrition of a growing human population. As heat stress (HS) is one of the main abiotic stresses, and is projected to increase due to global warming, it is necessary to better understand how plants respond and survive under HS. In Arabidopsis thaliana, plants can survive under severe HS if primed by a non-lethal HS, a process called acquisition of thermotolerance. This primed stated can be maintained for several days, and the ability of plants to maintain the primed state is called maintenance of acquired thermotolerance (mATT) or HS memory. According to current research, two Heat shock factors (HSFs) HSFA2 and HSFA3 are known to account for the majority of mATT capability, and there are other HSFs e.g. HSFA1b and HSFA6b in HSF complexes containing HSFA2 and/or HSFA3, however, the roles of these HSFs in HS memory is not clearly understood. Moreover, the mechanism of these HSFs in regulating HS memory is ...",gnd:4391224-2 gnd:4326741-5
Comparative mitochondrial genomics in basal metazoans : new phylogenetic and functional approaches,"The phylum Placozoa is crucial for understanding the early evolutionary pathways of animal mitochondrial genomes. The studies conducted in this thesis target early metazoan mitochondrial phylogenetics, placozoan mitochondrial mRNA processing and comparative placozoan mitochondrial genomics and its implications for placozoan taxonomy. In order to test the effect of taxon sampling on metazoan mitochondrial phylogenies, five comprehensive whole mitochondrial data sets were generated and analyzed. The outcomes of the analyses support some well-known topologies, but also reveal some problematic taxa. In sum, with respect to phylogenetics, mitochondrial data sets perform best below the phylum-level, as current evolutionary models struggle with data heterogeneity and long-branch attraction artifacts. Deep RNA sequencing revealed the existence of a single base pair cox1 micro exon but does not support mRNA editing in Placozoa. This cox1 micro exon is the first mitochondrial single base pair exon reported from an animal. The comparative analyses of nine new placozoan mitochondrial genomes revealed an unexpected diversity and complex evolutionary history of mitochondrial DNA characteristics within Placozoa. Complemented by nuclear genome data, this mtDNA diversity yielded the formal description of the new placozoan genus Polyplacotoma. The analyses also provided new important insights into enrichment patterns of GC-rich hairpins, the evolution of gene orders and complex fragmentation patterns of placozoan mitochondrial genes.",gnd:4076110-1 gnd:4200230-8 gnd:4012494-0 gnd:4113937-9 gnd:4268645-3 gnd:4420917-4

Characteristics of salt flow and syn-kinematic sedimentary structures in extensional basins,"Salt tectonics can significantly affect structure and depositional patterns of evaporite-bearing sedimentary basins, because rock salt deformation behaviour corresponds to that of a viscous fluid. Consequently, salt is able to flow according to an internal hydraulic-head gradient and produce local subsidence centres in regions of salt expulsion and topographic uplifts (e.g. salt diapirs, salt pillows) in regions of salt influx. In many world-wide salt-bearing sedimentary basins, e.g. the Southern Permian Basin in central Europe, a hydraulic-head gradient and consequent salt flow is induced by phases of regional tectonic extension. In such a tectonic setting, differential basement subsidence, e.g. due to normal faulting of sub-salt basement, may result in gravitationally driven flow towards the basin centre, and differential loading between basin lows and their flanks potentially squeezes salt away from imposed loads and causes upward directed salt flow. In order to investigate effects of syn- and post-extensional salt flow on structure and subsidence pattern of a basin, analogue experiments as well as analytical and numerical modelling are frequently applied. Existing analogue modelling studies dealing with processes of extensionally driven salt tectonics mostly examined brittle deformation and sedimentary structures in the supra-salt overburden, but rarely investigated flow pattern in the viscous substratum. Numerous analytical and numerical modelling studies, in contrast, addressed dynamics of flow in the salt, but only a few included sub-salt normal faulting as a trigger for salt flow. ...",gnd:4178956-8 gnd:4157973-2 gnd:4144249-0 gnd:4786449-7 gnd:4020227-6 gnd:4170297-9 gnd:4180610-4 gnd:4225664-1 gnd:4137469-1 gnd:4238903-3 gnd:4173820-2

Modeling and simulation of population balances for particulate processes,"This work focuses on the modeling and numerical approximations of population balance equations (PBEs) for the simulation of different phenomena occurring in process engineering. The population balance equation (PBE) is considered to be a statement of continuity. It tracks the change in particle size distribution as particles are born, die, grow or leave a given control volume. In the population balance models the one independent variable represents the time, the other(s) are property coordinate(s), e.g., the particle volume (size) in the present case. They typically describe the temporal evolution of the number density functions and have been used to model various processes such as granulation, crystallization, polymerization, emulsion and cell dynamics. The semi-discrete high resolution schemes are proposed for solving PBEs modeling one and two-dimensional batch crystallization models. The schemes are discrete in property coordinates but continuous in time. The resulting ordinary differential equations can be solved by any standard ODE solver. To improve the numerical accuracy of the schemes a moving mesh technique is introduced in both one and two-dimensional cases ...",gnd:4033215-9 gnd:4144119-9 gnd:4114528-8

Transformation processes of redox-sensitive trace metals in the water column and sediments of temperate tidal systems,"['Tidal flats represent the transition zone between the terrestrial and marine realm. They are subject to pronounced dynamics due to distinct tidal and seasonal variations of physical, chemical, and biological parameters significantly influencing redox-sensitive element cycles. Thus, redox-sensitive trace metals may be suitable indicators for variations in bioproductivity and microbial activity. Therefore, seasonal and tidal dynamics of manganese, iron, molybdenum, uranium, and vanadium were studied in the water column and sediments of tidal systems of the German Wadden Sea (southern North Sea) in the years 2007 to 2009 involving also previously analysed data from year 2002. To demonstrate the response of the trace metal cycles on phytoplankton blooms and enhanced biological activity time series data of nutrients and phytoplankton dynamics were also involved in this study. Pronounced cycling is seen for pelagic manganese revealing distinctly higher values during low tide. Complex seasonal cycling showing maxima of dissolved manganese in spring and late summer and a depletion period in early summer is caused by benthic-pelagic coupling and reflection of exhaustion and replenishing periods in the surface sediments. Vanadium dynamics are coupled to the manganese cycling due to vanadium scavenging and release during manganese oxide formation and reduction, respectively.

Ultrashort pulse induced nanostructures in transparent materials,"Glass fascinates mankind since its first discovery about 30 thousand years ago. Besides the challenging conditions for fabricating glasses with homogeneous properties the technological prospects for precise machining were first developed in the last millennium. While core areas of glass processing were dominated by well-established mechanical techniques such as scribing, grinding, sawing and polishing the technological progress and ongoing miniaturization demanded alternative processing tools. Within the end of the 20th century the development of ultrashort pulse laser systems paved the way for precise and cost-efficient solutions for materials processing in key technologies such as computer chips, medical surgery or in the field of automotive. Even more, the short pulse duration represents the key to locally process transparent materials within the bulk to induce modifications with feature sizes smaller than the wavelength of light [1, 2].  When focusing ultrashort laser pulses in the bulk of glass nonlinear absorption leads to extreme non-equilibrium states within a confined volume mediating the localized deposition of the laser pulse energy. Fused silica turned out as versatile platform to study the laser-induced modifications. Typically three different kinds are distinguished. First, isotropic refractive index changes allow for inscribing waveguides [3, 4] that may serve to realize complex photonic networks [5, 6]. Second, a confined micro-explosion within the focal volume may leave a region devoid of any material [7, 8] that can be used for data storage [9] or microfluidic purposes [10]. Finally, one of the key findings of laser materials processing is the local inscription of strong birefringence due to a sub-wavelength grating structure within an otherwise isotropic host material [11, 12].",gnd:4176622-2 gnd:4122915-0 gnd:4222149-3 gnd:4204530-7 gnd:4125030-8 gnd:4048455-5 gnd:4150434-3 gnd:4178309-8 gnd:4135379-1 gnd:4146360-2
The role of trapping in black hole spacetimes,"In the here presented work we discuss a series of results that are all in one way or another connected to the phenomenon of trapping in black hole spacetimes. First we present a comprehensive review of the Kerr-Newman-Taub-NUT-de-Sitter family of black hole spacetimes and their most important properties. From there we go into a detailed analysis of the bahaviour of null geodesics in the exterior region of a sub-extremal Kerr spacetime. We show that most well known fundamental properties of null geodesics can be represented in one plot. In particular, one can see immediately that the ergoregion and trapping are separated in phase space. We then consider the sets of future/past trapped null geodesics in the exterior region of a sub-extremal Kerr-Newman-Taub-NUT spacetime. We show that from the point of view of any timelike observer outside of such a black hole, trapping can be understood as two smooth sets of spacelike directions on the celestial sphere of the observer. Therefore the topological structure of the trapped set on the …",gnd:4139912-2 gnd:4302626-6 gnd:7550173-9 gnd:4045922-6 gnd:4349942-9 gnd:4156669-5 gnd:4053793-6
Light-driven diffusioosmosis : the manipulation of colloids using azobenzene containing surfactant,"The emergence of microfluidics created the need for precise and remote control of micron-sized objects. I demonstrate how light-sensitive motion can be induced at the micrometer scale by a simple addition of a photosensitive surfactant, which makes it possible to trigger hydrophobicity with light. With point-like laser irradiation, radial inward and outward hydrodynamic surface flows are remotely switched on and off. In this way, ensembles of microparticles can be moved toward or away from the irradiation center. Particle motion is analyzed according to varying parameters, such as surfactant and salt concentration, illumination condition, surface hydrophobicity, and surface structure. The physical origin of this process is the so-called light-driven diffusioosmosis (LDDO), a phenomenon that was discovered in the framework of this thesis and is described experimentally and theoretically in this work.

Higher order rectifiability in Euclidean space,"The first main goal of this thesis is to develop a concept of approximate differentiability of higher order for subsets of the Euclidean space that allows to characterize higher order rectifiable sets, extending somehow well known facts for functions. We emphasize that for every subset A of the Euclidean space and for every integer k ≥ 2 we introduce the approximate differential of order k of A and we prove it is a Borel map whose domain is a (possibly empty) Borel set. This concept could be helpful to deal with higher order rectifiable sets in applications. The other goal is to extend to general closed sets a well known theorem of Alberti on the second order rectifiability properties of the boundary of convex bodies. The Alberti theorem provides a stratification of second order rectifiable subsets of the boundary of a convex body based on the dimension of the (convex) normal cone. Considering a suitable generalization of this normal cone for general closed subsets of the Euclidean space and employing some results from the first part we can prove that the same stratification exists for every closed set.",gnd:4149807-0 gnd:4309127-1
On the fracture toughness of polymeric nanocomposites : Comprehensive stochastic and numerical studies,"Polymeric nanocomposites (PNCs) are considered for numerous nanotechnology such as: nano-biotechnology, nano-systems, nanoelectronics, and nano-structured materials. Commonly , they are formed by polymer (epoxy) matrix reinforced with a nanosized filler. The addition of rigid nanofillers to the epoxy matrix has offered great improvements in the fracture toughness without sacrificing other important thermo-mechanical properties. The physics of the fracture in PNCs is rather complicated and is influenced by different parameters. The presence of uncertainty in the predicted output is expected as a result of stochastic variance in the factors affecting the fracture mechanism. Consequently, evaluating the improved fracture toughness in PNCs is a challenging problem. Artificial neural network (ANN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) have been employed to predict the fracture energy of polymer/particle nanocomposites. The ANN and ANFIS models were constructed, trained, and tested based on a collection of 115 experimental datasets gathered from the literature. The performance evaluation indices of the developed ANN and ANFIS showed relatively small error, with high coefficients of determination (R2), and low root mean square error and mean absolute percentage error. In the framework for uncertainty quantification of PNCs, a sensitivity analysis (SA) has been conducted to examine the influence of uncertain input parameters on the fracture toughness of polymer/clay nanocomposites (PNCs). The phase-field approach is employed to predict the macroscopic properties of the composite considering six uncertain input parameters. The efficiency, robustness, and repeatability are compared and evaluated comprehensively for five different SA methods. The Bayesian method is applied to develop a methodology in order to evaluate the performance of different analytical models used in predicting the fracture toughness of polymeric particles nanocomposites. The developed method have considered the model and parameters uncertainties based on different reference data (experimental measurements) gained from the literature. Three analytical models differing in theory and assumptions were examined. The coefficients of variation of the model predictions to the measurements are calculated using the approximated optimal parameter sets. Then, the model selection probability is obtained with respect to the different reference data. Stochastic finite element modeling is implemented to predict the fracture toughness of polymer/particle nanocomposites. For this purpose, 2D finite element model containing an epoxy matrix and rigid nanoparticles surrounded by an interphase zone is generated. The crack propagation is simulated by the cohesive segments method and phantom nodes. Considering the uncertainties in the input parameters, a polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) surrogate model is construed followed by a sensitivity analysis.",gnd:4245375-6 gnd:4130868-2 gnd:4046699-1 gnd:4129730-1 gnd:4768127-5 gnd:4136911-7 gnd:4186957-6
"Catastrophic sediment pulses in the Pokhara Valley, Nepal","Fluvial terraces, floodplains, and alluvial fans are the main landforms to store sediments and to decouple hillslopes from eroding mountain rivers. Such low-relief landforms are also preferred locations for humans to settle in otherwise steep and poorly accessible terrain. Abundant water and sediment as essential sources for buildings and infrastructure make these areas amenable places to live at. Yet valley floors are also prone to rare and catastrophic sedimentation that can overload river systems by abruptly increasing the volume of sediment supply, thus causing massive floodplain aggradation, lateral channel instability, and increased flooding. Some valley-fill sediments should thus record these catastrophic sediment pulses, allowing insights into their timing, magnitude, and consequences. This thesis pursues this theme and focuses on a prominent ~150 km2 valley fill in the Pokhara Valley just south of the Annapurna Massif in central Nepal. The Pokhara Valley is conspicuously broad and gentle compared to the surrounding dissected mountain terrain, and is filled with locally more than 70 m of clastic debris. ...",gnd:4136552-5 gnd:4113593-3 gnd:4130033-6 gnd:4169027-8 gnd:4121639-8

Diagnostic of laser produced plasmas and investigation of laser-solid interactions using X-ray diffraction from bent crystals,"This thesis is composed of two parts. The objective of the first part was to investigate the influence of the intermediately coupled plasma environment on the radiating hydrogen-like aluminium ions by using high resolution, high dispersion vertical geometry Johann spectrometer. Benefiting from the high spectral and spatial resolution of the spectrometer as well as from optimized sandwich-target geometry, the influence of the ionization potential lowering and the influence of electron-plasma waves in the emission spectra are observed. These results have both practical and theoretical importance. Practical, because some signatures observed in the emission spectrum lead to a new density diagnostic, and, theoretical, because they can be used to test different theoretical formulations of radiator-plasma interactions. The second part of the thesis reports about the quantitative investigations of atomic motions in semiconducting samarium mono-sulphide (SmS) using optical pumping and X-ray probing. Coherent acoustic phonon propagation in semiconducting SmS is observed. The observed acoustic phonons have frequencies up to about 0.08 THz. The time resolved diffraction data are in good agreement with theoretical predictions for coherent phonon excitation, demonstrating that, up to the laser fluence of about 10 mJ/cm2 SmS behaves as a standard semiconductor, i.e., a semiconductor which (at the laser fluences used) shows no interplay between valence fluctuations and lattice vibrations.",gnd:4336833-5 gnd:4260997-5 gnd:4139081-7
Characterizing Entanglement and Quantum Correlations Constrained by Symmetry,"['This thesis focuses on the study and characterization of entanglement and nonlocal correlations constrained under symmetries.

Entanglement and nonlocal correlations constitute two fundamental resources for quantum information processing, as they allow novel tasks that are otherwise impossible in a classical scenario. However, their elusive characterization is still a central problem in quantum information theory. The main reason why such a fundamental issue remains a formidable challenge lies in the exponential growth in complexity of the Hilbert space as well as the space of multipartite correlations. Physical systems of interest, on the other hand, display symmetries that can be exploited to reduce this complexity, opening the possibility that some of these questions become tractable for such systems.', 'Introduction -- Background -- PPT Entangled Symmetric States -- Nonlocality in Multipartite Quantum States -- Relating Entanglement and Nonlocality -- Atomic Monogamies of Correlations -- Conclusions and Outlook.']",gnd:4356922-5 gnd:4842734-2 gnd:4058724-1 gnd:4334476-8 gnd:4705961-8 gnd:4409616-1 gnd:4653929-3 gnd:4596917-6

A macroeconomic model of West German unemployment : theory and evidence,"The book offers an explanation of unemployment based on a model of wage bargaining between a trade union and an employers' association. The theoretical model emphasizes the importance of distributional fairness in wage negotiations, especially with regard to factor taxation. This is achieved by the application of the proportional solution to the bargaining problem. It is shown, that this solution concept delivers a reasonable model of long run wage determination in which the natural rate of unemployment is independent of productivity growth. Taxes on labour and capital are identified as important determinants of equilibrium employment, the labour tax having a negative, the capital income taxhaving a positive effect. The latter result distinguishes the model from the standard literature. An empirical test using cointegration methods with West German data confirms the theoretical predictions.

Large scale tunneling junctions for electrically driven plasmonics,"This work focuses on the fabrication of light emitting tunneling junctions in planar configuration comprised of thin-film material stacks analog to metal-insulator-semiconductor plate capacitors. Electrical and structural properties are studied by different experimental techniques (current-voltage analysis, impedance spectroscopy) and compared to existing theories. Assessment of the junction quality is done in comparison to known features of electrically-driven plasmons, such as the bias dependent cut-off frequency, the dependency of the emission intensity on the tunneling current and tuneability of the spectra by implementation of different materials. Enhanced scattering and tuneability of light emission features from tunneling junctions by adsorption of chemically-synthesized nanoparticles is demonstrated and localization of the emission hot spots by correlation with measurements in external illumination and topography scans are discussed. Operational stability is increased by decoupling of the fabrication sub-steps, i.e. deposition of high quality thin-film stacks and chemical synthesis of particles with tailored optical properties. The role of nanoparticle geometry and material as hot spots in light emitting tunneling junctions is described and distinguished to reference experiments with external illumination. Emission instabilities in low-frequency regimes from hot spots with uncorrelated phases have been observed and are discussed. Potential transferability of electrically-driven plasmons to established detection schemes is demonstrated exemplary by mimicking a study of a plasmonic nanoruler. Additionally, a first proof-of-principle study on the emission from light emitting tunneling junctions in direct water immersion is described.",gnd:4333369-2

Stalk structures in lipid bilayer fusion studied by x-ray diffraction,"The fusion of two biological membranes is an important step in many processes on the cellular and sub-cellular level. Understanding the involved interplay of different lipid species, a specialized protein machinery and water on length scales of few nanometers poses a significant challenge to current structural biology. Among several complementary approaches, one strategy is to study the structural rearrangements of the lipid matrix. As the initial step, lipid bilayers must be forced into close contact to form a non-bilayer intermediate termed a stalk. This has been the subject of numerous theoretical studies and simulations, but experimental data on stalks are largely lacking. Currently, the only way to obtain structural information at the required sub-nanometer resolution is x-ray diffraction on the recently discovered stalk phaseʺ formed by certain lipids. We apply this method to elucidate the effect of lipid composition on stalk geometry and the repulsive forces between lipid bilayers prior to stalk formation. An approach based on differential geometry of electron density isosurfaces is introduced to analyze the curvatures and bending energies of the lipid monolayers. For the first time, this connects experiment-based structures of stalks and the associated bending and hydration energies. In addition, this thesis aims to provide a self-contained introduction to the required background in x-ray diffraction on lipid mesophases and electron density reconstruction.",gnd:4167790-0 gnd:4210049-5
Die Tankstelle : ein Bautypus im Wandel seiner Symbolhaftigkeit,"['From early modernist designs like Hans Poelzig’s archetypal gas station to the Stuttgarter Schule standardized filling stations on the Reichsautobahn, and through to Lothar Götz’s modular post-war constructions—which paved the way for the standardized corporate designs that flourished later—gas stations have been a key element of our surroundings since the 1920s. While the design and construction of gas stations has since become a significant area of work for well-known architecture and engineering firms, this type of building has thus far received barely any attention in academic discourse. Franz Arlart examines and systematizes the development of gas stations in Germany with reference to the architects that designed them. Taking into account functional, technical, and symbolic considerations, this book presents the architectural development of the building type from 1920 to 2020 and outlines the trends that will shape gas station design going forward', 'Von frühen modernistischen Designs wie der Typentankstelle von Hans Poelzig, den Reichsautobahn-Normentankstellen der Stuttgarter Schule bis zu Lothar Götz’ modularen Nachkriegstypenbauten als Wegbereiter späterer standardisierter Corporate Designs: Seit den 1920er Jahren prägen Tankstellen unsere Umgebung.

Non-perturbative renormalization on the lattice,"Strongly-interacting theories lie at the heart of elementary particle physics. Their distinct behaviour shapes our world sui generis. We are interested in lattice simulations of supersymmetric models, but every discretization of space-time inevitably breaks supersymmetry and allows renormalization of relevant susy-breaking operators. To understand the role of such operators, we study renormalization group trajectories of the nonlinear O(N) Sigma model (NLSM). Similar to quantum gravity, it is believed to adhere to the asymptotic safety scenario. By combining the demon method with blockspin transformations, we compute the global flow diagram. In two dimensions, we reproduce asymptotic freedom and in three dimensions, asymptotic safety is demonstrated. Essential for these results is the application of a novel optimization scheme to treat truncation errors. We proceed with a lattice simulation of the supersymmetric nonlinear O(3) Sigma model. Using an original discretization that requires to fine tune only a single operator, we argue that the continuum limit successfully leads to the correct continuum physics. Unfortunately, for large lattices, a sign problem challenges the applicability of Monte Carlo methods. Consequently, the last chapter of this thesis is spent on an assessment of the fermion-bag method. We find that sign fluctuations are thereby significantly reduced for the susy NLSM. The proposed discretization finally promises a direct confirmation of supersymmetry restoration in the continuum limit. For a complementary analysis, we study the one-flavor Gross-Neveu model which has a complex phase problem. However, phase fluctuations for Wilson fermions are very small and no conclusion can be drawn regarding the potency of the fermion-bag approach for this model.",gnd:4014414-8 gnd:4177773-6 gnd:4128574-8
Mountain-range uplift & climate-system interactions in the Southern Central Andes,"Two of the most controversial issues concerning the late Cenozoic evolution of the Andean orogen are the timing of uplift of the intraorogenic Puna plateau and its eastern border, the Eastern Cordillera, and ensuing changes in climatic and surface-process conditions in the intermontane basins of the NW-Argentine Andes. The Eastern Cordillera separates the internally drained, arid Puna from semi-arid intermontane basins and the humid sectors of the Andean broken foreland and the Subandean fold-and-thrust belt to the east. With elevations between 4,000 and 6,000 m the eastern flanks of the Andes form an efficient orographic barrier with westward-increasing elevation and asymmetric rainfall distribution and amount with respect to easterly moisture-bearing winds. This is mirrored by pronounced gradients in the efficiency of surface processes that erode and re-distribute sediment from the uplifting ranges. Although the overall pattern of deformation and uplift in this sector of the southern central Andes shows an eastward migration of deformation, a well-developed deformation front does not exist and uplift and associated erosion and sedimentary processes are highly disparate in space and time. In addition, periodic deformation within intermontane basins, and continued diachronous foreland uplifts associated with the reactivation of inherited basement structures furthermore make a rigorous assessment of the spatiotemporal uplift patterns difficult.",gnd:4317123-0 gnd:4073512-6 gnd:4442915-0 gnd:4054080-7 gnd:4159340-6 gnd:4180614-1 gnd:4132462-6 gnd:4172850-6 gnd:4169027-8 gnd:4144249-0 gnd:4015366-6
"Exciting imperfection : real-structure effects in magnesium-, cadmium-, and zinc-oxide","Computational condensed-matter physics, as a branch of modern solid-state physics, comprises the field of ab-initio calculations. Nowadays, challenging parameter-free studies can be carried out that deal with the many-body aspects due to the involved electron-electron interaction. Theoretical-spectroscopy techniques provide insight into electronic excitations, paving the way towards computer-aided materials design, e.g., for photovoltaics. In this thesis the transparent conductive oxides MgO, ZnO, and CdO are investigated; they are important materials for transparent-oxide electronics. Initially, a hybrid functional is used to model exchange and correlation. Subsequently, quasiparticle energies are calculated using Hedin's GW approximation of the electronic self energy. This leads to band structures, densities of states, spin-orbit splittings, effective band masses, and natural band discontinuities. Solving a Bethe-Salpeter equation for the optical polarization function yields the complex dielectric function including excitonic and local-field effects. All underlying atomic geometries result from density-functional theory based on local or semi-local approximations to exchange and correlation.",gnd:4136176-3 gnd:4143994-6
Route and operating optimization of maritime vessels using machine learning techniques,"The shipping industry handles over 90% of the global trade volume and is responsible for approximately 3% of global COâ emissions. Meanwhile, trade by the shipping industry is expected to increase by up to 130% by 2050 compared to 2008. At the same time, the goal is to reduce Green House Gas (GHG) emissions from the shipping industry to half of the 2008 level by 2050. In support of this goal, this thesis is concerned with a comprehensive approach for optimizing the ship's operation, i.e., an optimization approach that simultaneously involves route selection, energy management, propeller pitch, and engine control. In addition, this thesis also analyses the application of wind propulsion systems. The optimization of the ship's operation is implemented in the form of Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods. The use of RL-based methods to simultaneously optimize various aspects of the ship's trajectory and controls is a novel approach compared to the current state-of-art and embodies this thesis' inherent innovation.The results specifically highlight the importance of parallelizing route optimization with the optimization of other control aspects.Ultimately, it is found that the solution emanating from a purely RL-based approach can be further enhanced when the optimized route, speed, and power profiles are used to perform individual DP-based optimizations on the energy management in a post-processing step",gnd:7578671-0 gnd:4124833-8 gnd:4267628-9 gnd:4052385-8 gnd:4052411-5 gnd:4043664-0 gnd:4825546-4

Although the method creates the model directly and automatically from the given data, it is necessary to prepare the data correctly and support an environment in which the model could be stored, analyzed and executed in an efficient way. <engl.>', 'In dieser Arbeit geht es um die Modellierung des Fahrerverhaltens von Autofahrern.

Earthquake-induced landsliding : earthquakes as erosional agents across timescales,"Earthquakes deform Earth's surface, building long-lasting topographic features and contributing to landscape and mountain formation.However, seismic waves produced by earthquakes may also destabilize hillslopes, leading to large amounts of soil and bedrock moving downslope. Moreover, static deformation and shaking are suspected to damage the surface bedrock and therefore alter its future properties, affecting hydrological and erosional dynamics. Thus, earthquakes participate both in mountain building and stimulate directly or indirectly their erosion. Moreover, the impact of earthquakes on hillslopes has important implications for the amount of sediment and organic matter delivered to rivers, and ultimately to oceans, during episodic catastrophic seismic crises, the magnitude of life and property losses associated with landsliding, the perturbation and recovery of landscape properties after shaking, and the long term topographic evolution of mountain belts. Several of these aspects have been addressed recently through individual cas…",gnd:4169027-8 gnd:4126903-2 gnd:4015134-7

The impact of climate change law on the principle of state sovereignty over natural resources,The overarching objective of this book is to make a positive contribution to the global efforts to address the problem of climate change by considering the possible contribution of the international law principle of sovereignty over natural resources. The legal principle of sovereignty over natural resources is considered in this book as a means by which to address the lack of state compliance to climate commitments made in terms of the international legal climate change regime. The gravity of the effects of climate change justify a reinterpretation and reconfiguration of the principle of sovereignty over natural resources in terms of which the right of people to economic self-determination is promoted and constitutes a basis upon which states can be held accountable to climate commitments made in terms of the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement.,gnd:4164199-1 gnd:4075236-7 gnd:4048737-4 gnd:4132367-1

The calculations were carried out for the whole of Germany. The advantage of the method lies in the comprehensive inclusion of parameters, which determine the risk and exposure of non-target areas. In order to keep these parameters as realistic as possible, various data sources were made accessible and appropriate analysis methods were developed. This was achieved in particular by modeling the temporal and spatial relationships between target areas, non-target areas and refuges as well as by the use of temporally and spatially high-resolution data.

Numerical investigation of the turbulent ISM,"In this work we introduced basic turbulence theory into the framework of the interstellar medium. In many cases turbulence simulations are applied to the interstellar medium (ISM) merely because it is a medium, where extremely high Reynolds numbers are actually realised, and the parameters of the ISM are only taken into account as far as they are needed for the turbulence research. Here, however, we investigated the basic turbulence properties, while at the same time we modelled the properties of the ISM as thoroughly as possible. The important point is that there are many physical processes going on in the ISM, which should be incorporated in the corresponding simulations. These processes reachfrom external influences of the radiation field originating from hot stars to the internal interaction of the particles culminating in the intricate chemistry of the molecular cloud medium. Each of the different phases of the ISM has its own dominant processes to be taken into account for a realistic modelling ...",gnd:4128130-5 gnd:4117265-6 gnd:4162140-2
"Security Engineering with Patterns : Origins, Theoretical Model, and New Applications","For quite some time, in systems and software design, security only came as a second thought or even as a nice-to-have add-on. However, since the breakthrough of the Internet as a virtual backbone for electronic commerce and similar applications, security is now recognized as a fundamental requirement. This book presents a systematic security improvement approach based on the pattern paradigm. The author first clarifies the key concepts of security patterns, defines their semantics and syntax, demonstrates how they can be used, and then compares his model with other security approaches. Based on the author's model and best practice in security patterns, security novices are now in a position to understand how security experts solve problems and can basically act like them by using the patterns available as building blocks for their designs",gnd:4011144-1 gnd:4139375-2 gnd:4546895-3 gnd:4133586-7 gnd:4116522-6

The HILITE setup for high-intensity-laser experiments with highly charged ions : design and commissioning,"Quantitative studies of the interaction of atomic and molecular ions with laser radiation at high laser intensities and / or high photon energies are a novel area in the field of laser-matter-interaction. They are facilitated by precise knowledge of the properties of the ions as a target for the laser. This refers to the location, composition, density and shape of the ion cloud as a target, as well as to the capability of characterising the ion target before and after the laser interaction. Ion traps are versatile instruments when it comes to localising ions with a defined particle composition, density and state within a specific and small volume in space. They allow in particular the combination of ions in well-defined quantum states with intense photon fields. The present thesis contains the detailed description of the setup and commissioning of the HILITE Penning trap, which is dedicated to providing a well-defined cloud of highly charged ions for a number of different experiments with intense lasers. In the present thesis, the experimental setup is described in detail and the components required for ion target preparation, characterisation and non-destructive ion detection inside the trap are characterised. Special attention is paid to the counting limits of the detection electronics, because knowledge of the exact number of stored ions is essential for the planned experiments. Highly charged ions are produced in an electron-beam ion trap (EBIT), decelerated, dynamically captured and stored. For the preparation of a well-defined ion cloud, the initially high energetic ions must be slowed and cooled to an energy of less than 1 meV. This thesis describes the applied methods of active-feedback cooling and resistive cooling and examines their potential cooling efficiencies.",gnd:4153930-8 gnd:4246725-1 gnd:4034610-9 gnd:4245919-9 gnd:4226687-7
Innovative techniques for the characterization and interpretation of coastal aquifers : pumping test interpretation by means of the drawdown derivative to estimate aquifer heterogeneity,"Aquifers are intrinsically heterogeneous, but the interpretation of pumping tests to estimate hydraulic aquifer parameters, such as transmissivity and storativity, is commonly performed under the assumption of homogeneity, by utilizing Theis’ equation. This yields interpreted parameters whose relation to aquifer heterogeneity is uncertain. To optimize Theis-based pumping test interpretation techniques for the application to heterogeneous systems, this study investigates the relationship between the interpreted parameters and the underlying heterogeneity of aquifers. Two time-dependent spatial weighting functions are derived which enable the estimation of upscaled transmissivities from a given heterogeneous transmissivity distribution. The comparison of the upscaled transmissivities to the interpreted Theis-based transmissivities from synthetically generated pumping tests reveals that their meaning depends on the properties of the Theis solution, used during the interpretation process. If the interpreted transmissivity is estimated from the drawdown derivative it relates to an upscaled heterogeneous transmissivity field, but to an upscaled homogeneous transmissivity if the drawdown itself is used. This procedure is applied to infinite aquifers and to aquifers delimited by a linear constant head boundary (BCH). It is shown that Theis-based interpretation methods allow for assessing aquifer heterogeneity. Moreover, a new pumping test interpretation method for BCH aquifers is developed which allows for estimating the transmissivity continuously from the transient drawdown. The theoretical investigations are supplemented by the evaluation of real pumping tests in an aquifer system strongly affected by tectonics. In this regard, this study confirms that pumping test interpretation can provide fundamental information on reservoir boundaries and hydrogeological.",gnd:4022375-9 gnd:4672962-8 gnd:4026307-1

New anode- and cathode-active materials for organic batteries,"The development and synthesis of new polymers for organic batteries is a long and difficult process rife with challenges. However, the reward for this are suitable materials for the next generation of secondary batteries. The investigations within the scope of this thesis are focused on the discovery of new redox-active polymers suitable as active materials in batteries. These organic battery materials can compete with inorganic materials in terms of theoretical capacity, power and energy density. The most beneficial features of these compounds like light weight, flexibility, printability and environmental friendliness make them promising candidates for secondary organic batteries. With the vast repertoire of known redox-active species the transfer of those into a polymeric structure and their subsequent electrochemical testing can provide access to a wide variety of different electrode materials. In this thesis new polymers were developed as active battery-materials and tested for their capabilities in batteries. This includes the functionalization and optimization of well-known polymers like galvinoxyles and the incorporation of less-known redox-materials in polymeric compounds. Several new polymers, containing anode- or cathode-active compounds were synthesized. Galvinoxyl- and phenoxyl-compounds are addressed as well as quinones, anthraquinones and nitroxides. These polymeric compounds were subsequently intensively tested for their application as electrode material and incorporated into batteries, including the fabrication of a battery using inkjet-printing. By changing the functional groups of the polymers, their redox-potentials, stability or solubility are changed and new batteries were created. Those different batteries show the versatility of polymers as electrode-materials and the possibility to adjust a batteries capability to the desired specifications.",gnd:4004687-4 gnd:4403842-2 gnd:4319759-0 gnd:4155916-2
Quantum chemical investigation towards Raman enhancement effects,"A well-known drawback of Raman spectroscopy is the low signal intensity. Therefore, the present thesis aims to elucidate the fundamental principles in state-of-the-art signalenhanced Raman spectroscopy, i.e. resonance Raman (RR), surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) and tip-enhanced Raman scattering (TERS). Firstly, a new approach to evaluate RR scattering is discussed. This new approach, called real-time method, can evaluate the polarizabilitiy tensor in the time domain. The new method is benchmarked by being compared to other two well-known methods. All three methods give comparable results, and consequently, the novel computational approach is validated. Afterwards, the chemical e_ect of SERS is studied by means of a theoretical spectroscopic analysis of the cis/trans-isomers of a molecular switch, the penta-2,4-dienoic acid, attached to gold clusters of di_erent size (1, 2 and 20 gold atoms). By simulation of vibrational (IR, Raman and RR) and electronic spectroscopy (UV-vis), the e_ect of the molecule-metal nanoparticle interaction can be studied. Special emphasis is put on the resonance Raman spectra for the study of the isomers. In the present case, resonance Raman scattering is best suited to discriminate between the isomers on the gold clusters. Finally a full quantum chemical description of the non-resonant chemical e_ects of the Raman spectrum of an adenine molecule mapped by a silver tip is presented. The tip is modeled as a single silver atom and as a small silver cluster. Pronounced changes in the Raman pattern and its intensities depending on the conformation of the nanoparticlesubstrate system are found, concluding that the spatial resolution of the chemical contribution in TERS can be in the sub-nm range.",gnd:4176916-8

This work follows and draws together current trends amongst ancient historians who take a more positive view than hitherto of the value of rivers as natural barriers and of the defensive qualities of late-Roman frontier units. The Danube frontier, which was more than 2,500 kilometers long, simultaneously presented both advantages and disadvantages to its defenders. The formation of a large number of well-equipped naval units tasked with monitoring and protecting the river banks moved the first line of defence forward from the region immediately behind the rivers onto the rivers themselves. These units also compensated, at least partially, for the weakening of frontier defences brought about by the new strategy of Diocletian and especially that of Constantine, which located comitatenses troops in the hinterland.

The provision of local public goods and demographic change,"The main contribution of this thesis is a comprehensive analysis of the influence of changes in the population structure on local communities, in particular with respect to the provision of publicly provided goods. The focus is placed on the consequences of two of the major processes of demographic change, namely aging and shrinking. The three main chapters of this contribution consider the effects at the local level from both a theoretical and an empirical perspective. The first model focuses on the influence of population aging on the provision of local publicly provided goods, when the young population may relocate. When aging advances, gerontocracies and social planners substitute publicly provided goods aimed at the mobile young for publicly provided goods for the elderly. However, due to fiscal competition, gerontocracies will provide even more of the publicly provided good for the young than the social planner. The second model considers in a two-period setting, the interaction of a shrinking population when the investments made by the previous generation are long lived. The laissez-faire and welfare maximizing outcomes are computed for two cases; first with no costs of upkeep and second for the case when costs of upkeep accrue. A comparison of the solutions shows that public provision for the first generation is inefficiently low in laissez-faire when there are no costs of upkeep. However, if costs of upkeep accrue, the laissez-faire outcome for the intergenerational publicly provided good may be too high. Chapter four contains an empirical analysis. In a two-stage analysis the efficiency of the provision of child care services in municipalities is evaluated in the German State of Saxony. First, the results of the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) show substantial efficiency differences; the median municipality is up to 28% inefficient. In a second stage bootstrapped truncated regression, determinants of the inefficiency are identified. Explanatory variables such as an uncompensated mayor or a larger share of over 65-year-olds significantly increase inefficiency.",gnd:4511937-5
ABC fürs Leben - Sind Achtsamkeitsprogramme im Schulkontext ein wirksamer Ansatz?,"['Introduction: Mindfulness programs for schools are popular. Currently, the enthusiasm for this approach outweighs the evidence supporting its application. In this dissertation I present a) a meta-analytic review of the existing evidence and b) further empirical data regarding the efficacy of mindfulness-based school programs, also considering the me- thodological quality of evaluation studies in this nascent field. Methods: a) In order to locate both published and unpublished studies a comprehensive search strategy was applied. Data on methodology and outcomes of included studies were extracted. Effect sizes were combined using the random-effect model. b) In two pilot stu- dies, effects of a mindfulness-based school program on measures of attention, self- regulation, empathy, mental health and well-being were examined in a controlled pre-post design. In study I, n = 20 fourth grade students took part in a 6 week-mindfulness pro- gram; in study II, n = 25 second grade students participated in a modified version of the mindfulness program (20 weeks). Parallel classes served as the control. Results: a) Twenty-four studies were located, of which eleven were unpublished. Nineteen studies used a controlled design. Altogether, 1,348 students were instructed in mindful- ness, with 863 serving as comparison groups, ranging from school grades 1 to 12. Overall effect sizes were g = 0.41 within groups and g = 0.40 between groups. Domain specific, controlled, effect sizes varied from g = 0.80 for measures of cognitive performance to g = 0.19 for measures of emotional problems. However, heterogeneity was significant and could partly be explained by the intensity of mindfulness programs. b) In study I, interac- tion effects (time x group) occurred in three subscales of teacher ratings on mental health (hyperactivity/inattention, peer relationship problems, prosocial behaviour), indicating the superiority of the control (all p ≤ .05). In study II, interaction effects (time x group) occur- red in one subscale of teacher questionnaires in mental health (conduct problems, p ≤ .01) and in two subscales of after-school-care teachers (peer relationship problems, prosocial behaviour (both p ≤ .05)), reflecting improvement in the mindfulness class. In general, the feasibility of this evaluation can be confirmed, but the adequacy of some measures being applied in this field of research need to be adressed. Conclusion: Preliminary evidence supports the efficacy of mindfulness programs, but replication in rigorous research designs is required. Future research should consider the special features of students and the school setting.…', 'Einleitung: Obwohl Achtsamkeitsprogramme für den Bildungsbereich zunehmend an Popularität gewinnen, ist die empirische Basis für deren Anwendung noch unzureichend.

Methode: a) Um auch nicht-publizierte Studien ausfindig machen zu können, wurde eine weitläufige Suchstrategie gewählt. Informationen zur Studienqualität sowie quantitative Daten wurden extrahiert und Effektstärken auf Basis des Modells zufallsvariabler Effekte ermittelt. b) In 2 Pilotstudien wurde die Wirksamkeit eines Achtsamkeitsprogramms in Bezug auf spezifische Aufmerksamkeitsfähigkeiten, die Selbstregulationsfähigkeit, die Empathiefähigkeit, psychische Gesundheit und das Wohlbefinden in einem kontrollierten Prä-post-Design untersucht. In Studie I nahm eine 4. Klasse (n = 20) an einem sechswö-chigen Achtsamkeitsprogramm teil, während in Studie II eine 2. Klasse (n = 25) an einer modifizierten Version des Programms (20 Wochen) teilnahm. Die jeweilige Parallelklasse fungierte als Kontrollgruppe. Ergebnisse: a) 24 Studien konnten ausfindig gemacht werden, von denen 11 nicht publi-ziert sind. Größtenteils wurden kontrollierte Designs (k = 19) verwendet. Von Klasse 1 bis Klasse 12 nahmen insgesamt 1348 Schülerinnen und Schüler an einem Achtsamkeits-training teil und 871 fungierten als Kontrollgruppe. Die globalen Effekte beliefen sich auf g = 0.40 für kontrollierte und g = .41 für Prä-post-Effektgrößen. Domänenspezifische, kontrollierte Effektgrößen variierten zwischen g = 0.80 für Maße der kognitiven Perfor-manz und g = 0.19 für emotionale Probleme. Jedoch war die Varianz der Studieneffekte überzufällig groß. Sie konnte zum Teil durch die unterschiedliche Intensität der Pro-gramme aufgeklärt werden. b) In Studie I ergaben sich hypothesenkonträre Interaktionsef-fekte (Zeit x Gruppe) für drei Subskalen eines Lehrkräftefragebogens (Hyperaktivi-tät/Unaufmerksamkeit, Probleme mit Gleichaltrigen, prosoziales Verhalten, alle p ≤ .05). In Studie II zeigten sich hypothesenkonforme Interaktionseffekte (Zeit x Gruppe) für die von den Klassenlehrerinnen eingeschätzte Subskala Verhaltensprobleme (p ≤ .01) sowie für die von den Horterzieherinnen eingeschätzten Subskalen Probleme mit Gleichaltrigen und Prosoziales Verhalten (beide p ≤ .05).

Improved flood risk assessment : new data sources and methods for flood risk modelling,"Rivers have always flooded their floodplains. Over 2.5 billion people worldwide have been affected by flooding in recent decades. The economic damage is also considerable, averaging 100 billion US dollars per year. There is no doubt that damage and other negative effects of floods can be avoided. However, this has a price: financially and politically. Costs and benefits can be estimated through risk assessments. Questions about the location and frequency of floods, about the objects that could be affected and their vulnerability are of importance for flood risk managers, insurance companies and politicians. Thus, both variables and factors from the fields of hydrology and sociol-economics play a role with multi-layered connections. One example are dikes along a river, which on the one hand contain floods, but on the other hand, by narrowing the natural floodplains, accelerate the flood discharge and increase the danger of flooding for the residents downstream. Such larger connections must be included in the assessment of flood risk. ...",gnd:4220751-4 gnd:4131972-2 gnd:4025289-9

"""Villages"" in Shenzhen : persistence and transformation of an old social system in an emerging mega city","In the history of 'villages' in Shenzhen, rich traditional cultural resources that are directly related to the folk life in urban corporate community still exist today, synchronously agricultural economy of urban corporate community is transformed into joint-stock economy, and natural villages are transformed into 'heterogeneous' space of city. The most significant fact in the modern social transition is that modern societies have surpassed traditional societies, and cities have surpassed the country. Weber, Durkheim, Tönnies, Simmel and others devoted themselves to cultivating the essence of social transition. The most influential theory to observe and analyze it is the two-tiered approach of ideal type. Tönnies made distinction between 'Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft', Durkheim distinguished 'mechanical solidarity and organic solidarity', and Redfield analyzed 'folk society and urban society'. In those classical theories, the former transit to the later is considered to be a general rule of transition from traditional society to modern society, and from traditional community to modern community. However, ever since Redfield used the dependent relationship and interactive framework of 'great tradition' and 'little tradition' to explain various complicated phenomena in the transition from tradition to modern in 1950s, he suggested that a folk-urban continuum can be formed in the transition from folk society to urban society. ...",gnd:4055764-9 gnd:4022233-0 gnd:4063234-9 gnd:4012775-8

The metagalactic UV background at z < 3,"The high ionization state of the intergalactic medium (IGM) is maintained by the metagalactic UV background radiation. This ionizing radiation field is supposed to be the integrated radiation of quasars and young star-forming galaxies, which is reprocessed and attenuated by the intergalactic gas. Since the UV background is inaccessible to direct observations, it is impossible to test theoretical predictions of its spectral energy distribution in great detail. However, constraints can be derived from studies of metal absorption systems, the HI Lyman alpha opacity, or the HeII Lyman alpha forest, respectively. Observations of the HeII/HI column density ratio eta particularly probe the variations of the UV background. Since unobscured quasars permitting observation of HeII absorption are rare, there are only two lines of sight, towards the quasars HE2347-4342 and HS1700+6416, where the HeII Lyman alpha forest can be resolved. This work presents a study of the UV background at redshifts z < 3 investigating the HeII absorption towards the quasars HS1700+6416 (z = 2.72), which provides the second line of sight where the HeII Lyman alpha forest is resolved. The numerous metal line systems detected in the spectra of this QSO are studied in order to avoid biases due to unrecognized metal line absorption in the HeII forest. In this connection, several shapes of the ionizing radiation are tested for each system. The majority of the considered systems, in particular those at z > 2, is best reproduced with an ionizing radiation similar to the UV background of Haardt & Madau (2001), where the HeII break, formally located at 4 Ryd, is shifted to lower energies (~ 3 Ryd), probably due to the opacity of the higher HeII Lyman series lines ...",gnd:4326736-1 gnd:4382334-8

Kinetics of phase separation and thin film formation of multiresponsive polymers,"In this thesis, we were interested in studying the deposition of layers formed by stimuli-responsive colloidal soft particles using a surface acoustic wave method: “Quartz Crystal Microbalance with Dissipation Monitoring, (QCM-D)”. This thesis is divided into four chapters: chapter 1 gives an introduction to the structural properties of polymers and glasses in solution and at interfaces, chapter 2 presents the principles of the QCM-D monitoring technique in terms of the physical meaning of its main output (the normalized resonance frequency shift Δfn/n and dissipation factor shift ΔDn) and important parameters to consider while carrying out our study (temperature and light control). Chapter 3 is dedicated to deposition control of soft layers formed out of dual stimuli-responsive colloidal particles of Poly (triethylene glycol acrylate-co-Spiropyran acrylate) (P(TEGA-co-SPA)). In this chapter, we examine the concomitant effect of light and temperature in order to manipulate the formation process of soft glassy films and their subsequent structural response. Chapter 4 presents the kinetics of the deposition of Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) P(NIPAAm) soft glassy layers. In this chapter, we focus on the effect of temperature and concentration on the isothermal glass formation below and above the phase separation temperature using a twostep kinetic model. We also provide a subsequent analysis of the viscoelastic properties of the deposited layers in non-isothermal mode and compare it with their properties in isothermal mode. The present study extends the state of the art in two main disciplines. The first discipline is fundamental research in glass sciences and the second discipline is the research of multi stimuli-responsive polymers, where our findings would be of great interest for applications that need remote-controlled switching, especially in microfluidic chips and biomedical applications.",gnd:4175236-3 gnd:4021142-3
"Understanding trans-basin floods in Germany : data, information and knowledge","Large Central European flood events of the past have demonstrated that flooding can affect several river basins at the same time leading to catastrophic economic and humanitarian losses that can stretch emergency resources beyond planned levels of service. For Germany, the spatial coherence of flooding, the contributing processes and the role of trans-basin floods for a national risk assessment is largely unknown and analysis is limited by a lack of systematic data, information and knowledge on past events. This study investigates the frequency and intensity of trans-basin flood events in Germany. It evaluates the data and information basis on which knowledge about trans-basin floods can be generated in order to improve any future flood risk assessment. In particu-lar, the study assesses whether flood documentations and related reports can provide a valuable data source for understanding trans-basin floods. An adaptive algorithm was developed that systematically captures trans-basin floods using series of mean daily discharge at a large number of sites of even time series length (1952-2002). It identifies the simultaneous occurrence of flood peaks based on the exceedance of an initial threshold of a 10 year flood at one location and consecutively pools all causally related, spatially and temporally lagged peak recordings at the other locations. A weighted cumulative index was developed that accounts for the spatial extent and the individual flood magnitudes within an event and allows quantifying the overall event severity. The parameters of the method were tested in a sensitivity analysis. An intensive study on sources and ways of information dissemination of flood-relevant publications in Germany was conducted. Based on the method of systematic reviews a strategic search approach was developed to identify relevant documentations for each of the 40 strongest trans-basin flood events. A novel framework for assessing the quality of event specific flood reports from a user’s perspective was developed and validated by independent peers. The framework was designed to be generally applicable for any natural hazard type and assesses the quality of a document addressing accessibility as well as representational, contextual, and intrinsic dimensions of quality. The analysis of time-series of mean daily discharge resulted in the identification of 80 trans-basin flood events within the period 1952-2002 in Germany. The set is dominated by events that were recorded in the hydrological winter (64%); 36% occurred during the summer months. The occurrence of floods is characterised by a distinct clustering in time. Dividing the study period into two sub-periods, we find an increase in the percentage of winter events from 58% in the first to 70.5% in the second sub-period. Accordingly, we find a significant increase in the number of extreme trans-basin floods in the second sub-period. A large body of 186 flood relevant documentations was identified. For 87.5% of the 40 strongest trans-basin floods in Germany at least one report has been found and for the most severe floods a substantial amount of documentation could be obtained. 80% of the material can be considered grey literature (i.e. literature not controlled by commercial publishers). The results of the quality assessment show that the majority of flood event specific reports are of a good quality, i.e. they are well enough drafted, largely accurate and objective, and contain a substantial amount of information on the sources, pathways and receptors/consequences of the floods. The inclusion of this information in the process of knowledge building for flood risk assessment is recommended. Both the results as well as the data produced in this study are openly accessible and can be used for further research. The results of this study contribute to an improved spatial risk assessment in Germany. The identified set of trans-basin floods provides the basis for an assessment of the chance that flooding occurs simultaneously at a number of sites. The information obtained from flood event documentation can usefully supplement the analysis of the processes that govern flood risk.",gnd:4025289-9
On the spectral theory of operators on trees,"We study a class of rooted trees with a substitution type structure. These trees are not necessarily regular, but exhibit a lot of symmetries. We consider nearest neighbor operators which reflect the symmetries of the trees. The spectrum of such operators is proven to be purely absolutely continuous and to consist of finitely many intervals. We further investigate stability of the absolutely continuous spectrum under perturbations by sufficiently small potentials. On the one hand, we look at a class of deterministic potentials which include radial symmetric ones. The absolutely continuous spectrum is stable under sufficiently small perturbations of this type if and only if the tree is not regular. On the other hand, we study random potentials. In this case, we prove stability of absolutely continuous spectrum for both regular and non regular trees provided the potentials are sufficiently small.",gnd:4046939-6 gnd:4149798-3

"Do microbial or biochemical settlement cues on the sediment surface mediate larval settlement of Polydora cornuta and Streblospio benedicti (Polychaeta, Spionidae)?","['Distinctive, patchy abundance patterns of spionid polychaetes i.e. Polydora cornuta and Streblospio benedicti with indirect larval development were found in sediments of tidal flats in the German Wadden Sea.

Autonome Sensorsysteme in der Transport- und Lebensmittellogistik,"Autonomous agents, transport telematics, wireless sensor networks, intelligent container. - A concise supervision of food products during transport is an essential precondition for the improvement of their quality and reduction of losses. However, existing remote or telemetric systems implement only parts of the entire supervision task. Standard systems measure temperature only at one or two points, and the evaluation of sensor data has to be done manually. This thesis presents a system which measures a spatial profile of temperature and other parameters. The idea of remote transport supervision is extended to a self-contained sensor system that locally processes measurement data and detects critical situations autonomously. The algorithms for sensor data evaluation are implemented inside the means of transport; they can either share a common embedded processor unit or run separately on wireless sensors nodes, which are attached to the loaded freight objects. The system automatically adapts the supervision process to different kinds of goods. This intelligent container combines technologies from different fields, such as RFID, wireless sensor networks, and telemetric system, which have so far been applied separately. A shelf life model, based on the dynamic temperature profile, estimates the amount of quality loss during transport. The quality supervision is implemented as a set of software agents. Each freight object is supervised by an individual sensory way bill .

Behaviour of tiang tongkat foundation over Pontianak soft organic soil using 3D-finite element analysis,"Peat deposits are distributed mostly along the coast of West Kalimantan, Indonesia, particularly in and around the provincial capital of Pontianak. There are many problems with constructing over peat soil as the existence of this type of soil always generates geotechnical engineering problems for regional development. For light construction on peat land, several variations of Indonesian traditional floating wood foundations, commonly called tiang tongkat foundations, are still being used today. A tiang tongkat foundation of any dimension is constructed over different fields. The foundation was modelled as three-dimensional linear elastic and the Pontianak soft organic soil was modelled as undrained Soft-Soil-Creep Model. All of the 324 models were made to be used for simulation by means of the Plaxis 3-Dimensional Foundation Program. The purpose of this analysis is to predict the load-settlement behaviour and the capacity of traditional foundations. The comparison between field tests and numerical analysis and analytical solutions are also demonstrated.",gnd:4131134-6 gnd:4181092-2 gnd:4185722-7 gnd:4137134-3 gnd:4170520-8
The role of Desulfitobacterium spp. in the global network of O-demethylation in soil,"Bacteria that belong to the genus Desulfitobacterium are able to cleave the ether bond of lignin-borne phenyl methyl ethers via O-demethylation of the methoxy moiety. Phenyl methyl ethers occur naturally in soils and originate from lignin degradation by white rot fungi under aerobic conditions. In order to assess the possible involvement of the anaerobic desulfitobacteria in the network of lignin degradation in soils, their participation in the O-demethylation of phenyl methyl ethers in the environment was studied. In growth experiments, several Desulfitobacterium spp. were able to O-demethylate the phenyl methyl ethers 4-hydroxyanisole, syringate, vanillate and isovanillate in the presence of fumarate, nitrate, thiosulfate or Fe(III) as electron acceptor. Only D. metallireducens completely lacked this ability. Up to 18 putative demethylase operons were identified in the genomes of desulfitobacteria. Bacterial enrichment cultures that originated from five different topsoils sampled in the vicinity of Jena (Germany) were used to assess desulfitobacterial O-demethylation in anoxic consortia. Enrichment with syringate and thiosulfate triggered an increase in Desulfitobacterium-specific 16S rRNA genes in all cultures as confirmed via quantitative PCR. The enrichment was followed by a loss of desulfitobacterial gene copies over time. Community-scale sequencing suggested an outcompetion of desulfitobacteria by acetogens. To allow a better quantification of desulfitobacteria in environmental samples, a new qPCR assay was established that uses the Desulfitobacterium-specific formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase (FTHFS) gene as marker. In contrast to the 16S rRNA gene assay, which detects several gene copies per genome, the new FTHFS assay detects only one gene copy. It is concluded that Desulfitobacterium spp. are involved in the O-demethylation of phenyl methyl ethers in the environment and play an important role within the network of lignin degradation in soils.",gnd:4515439-9
Hydrogen bond lifetimes and equilibria in hydroxyl-functionalized ionic liquids,"This work investigates the hydrogen bond (HB) lifetimes and equilibrium in hydroxyl-functionalized pyridinium-based ionic liquids. Two types of intermolecular HBs are observed: typical cation-anion HBs are competing with atypical cation-cation HBs . By employing molecular dynamics simulations, the equilibrium between those HBs was examined as a function of temperature and alkyl chain length. In addition, the influence of the different HBs on the structure and dynamics of the ionic liquid are discussed. Also, HB lifetimes where examined.<eng>",gnd:4045959-7 gnd:7548899-1 gnd:4064787-0
Engineering cell membrane by liposomal treatment modulates endocytosis of nanomaterials in tumor cells,"Abstract: Nanomedicines, including liposomes and polymeric nanoparticles, can target tumor cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis. However, the role of biophysics of cell lipid bilayer in nanoparticle uptake pathway remains unexplored. Nanomedicines are taken up mainly via clathrin/caveolae-mediated endocytosis, which depends on membrane deformation. Since phase behavior influences deformability of lipid bilayers, we postulated that phase behavior of cell membranes could impact endocytosis of nanomedicines.<br>In second section of the dissertation, we inquired whether endocytosis of liposomes, a lipid bilayer-derived vesicle, depends on their phase behavior. First, it was shown that the endocytosis of liposomes was related to their phase behavior and increasing membrane fluidity diminished dynamin-dependent endocytosis of liposomes. Since liposomal treatment can modify the phase behavior of cell membranes, we further theorized that altering phase behavior of cell membranes by liposomal pre-treatment could impact endocytosis of nanoparticles. Using rhodamine-labeled PLGA nanoparticles and NBD-cholesterol labeled liposomes (100 nm) as models for nanomedicine, and employing giant plasma membrane vesicles (GPMV) derived from MDA-MB-231 as model for the cell membrane the effect of liposomal treatment on nanomedicine uptake as investigated. Characterization of the stiffness of GPMV using flicker spectroscopy revealed that liposomal treatment can modify the stiffness and lipid composition of cell membrane, thereby modulating endocytic uptake of PLGA NPs. The increased cell membrane stiffness was found to elevate cellular uptake of NPs by promoting clathrin/caveolae/dynamin-mediated endocytosis.<br>Cellular uptake of lipid vesicles is important for cell communication and drug delivery. Since lipid vesicles can be taken up by the cells upon interacting with plasma membranes, in section three of the dissertation, it was postulated that the pattern of membrane interaction would determine endocytic uptake mechanism of liposomes. Since cholesterol can influence the phase behavior and curvature of lipid bilayers, and thereby impacting interaction between lipid bilayers, the role of liposomal free cholesterol in liposome-cell interaction was investigated. We found that efficiency of nonspecific membrane interaction was associated with cellular uptake mechanisms of liposomes and liposomal free cholesterol enhanced the non-specific liposome-cell membrane interaction; resu ...",gnd:4078460-5 gnd:4333369-2 gnd:4186433-5

Die Bedeutung beruflicher Zielklarheit im Studium - eine empirische Annäherung,"['The clarity of vocational goals gains importance in the newly developed Bachelor and Master programs at German Universities. In this work an integrative theoretical model of clarity of vocational goals and adjustment to university was empirically tested. An interview study (N = 30) and an online survey with two points of measurement were conducted (first measurement: N = 306; second measurement: N = 130). Structural equation modeling shows that occupational self-efficacy (\uf062 = .18) and application-oriented career exploration (\uf062 = .26) are important predictors of clarity of vocational goals. Adjustment to university is explained by clarity of vocational goals (\uf062 = .39) and domain interest (\uf062 = .38). Latent True Change Modeling shows the influence of clarity of vocational goals on adjustment to university over a time period of five months (\uf062 = .48). Four types of students were identified based on their clarity of vocational goals and their activities in career exploration. Students lacking in clarity of vocational goals need support to specify a vocation goal and to explore their environment or themselves. These students show a lower commitment to their university studies. The majority of students rate career exploration as very important to promote clarity of vocational goals and career entry. Latent Class Analysis identified three types of career exploration: Most of the students focus on application-oriented career exploration (62 %), few students focus on mere self-exploration (11 %); 27 % of the students neither explore their environment nor themselves. The interviews and the survey show that many students need support to specify their vocational goals and that they wish university career services. In general all students expect more practical experience during studies. Furthermore, they wish specific occupational information in their field of studies. Recommendations for university curricula are derived from the results.', 'Die Klärung beruflicher Ziele während des Studiums gewinnt mit der Umstellung auf Bachelor- und Masterstudiengänge sowie aufgrund eines flexiblen und oft unbestimmten Verhältnisses von Studium und Beruf in zahlreichen Studiengängen an Bedeutung.

Interaction of atoms with twisted light,"Twisted photons are particles which carry a nonzero projection of the orbital angular momentum onto their propagation direction. During the last years, the interaction between twisted photons and atoms became an active area of fundamental and applied research. In the present work, we show how the “twistedness” of Bessel and Laguerre-Gauss photons may affect a number of fundamental light-matter interaction processes in comparison with the results for standard plane-wave radiation. In particular, we perform an analysis of the photoionization of hydrogen molecular ions by twisted photons. It is shown that the oscillations in the angular and energy distributions of photoelectrons are affected by the intensity profile of twisted photons. We also investigate the excitation of atoms by these twisted photons. We demonstrate here that the orbital angular momentum of light leads to the alignment or specific magnetic sublevel population of excited atoms. Apart from these studies, we explore the elastic Rayleigh scattering of twisted photons by hydrogenlike ions. Our results indicate that the “twistedness” of incident photons may significantly influence the polarization properties of scattered light.",gnd:4189262-8 gnd:4174506-1 gnd:4177106-0 gnd:4230288-2 gnd:4045922-6 gnd:4046482-9 gnd:4128386-7

Quantile methods for financial risk management,"This thesis develops new methods to assess two types of financial risk. Market risk is defined as the risk of losing money due to drops in the values of asset portfolios. Systemic risk refers to the breakdown risk for the financial system induced by the distress of individual companies. During the financial crisis 2007–2009, both types of risk materialized, resulting in huge losses for investors, companies, and tax payers all over the world. Therefore, considering new risk management alternatives is of interest for both financial institutions and regulatory authorities. A common feature of the models used throughout the thesis is that they adapt quantile regression techniques to the context of financial risk management in a novel way. Firstly, to predict extreme market risk, nonparametric quantile regression is combined with extreme value theory. The resulting extreme Value at Risk (VaR) forecast framework is applied to different international stock indices. In many situations, its performance is superior to parametric benchmark models. Secondly, a systemic risk measure, the realized systemic risk beta, is proposed. In contrast to exististing measures it is tailored to account for tail risk interconnections within the financial sector, individual firm characteristics, and financial indicators. To determine each company’s relevant risk drivers, model selection techniques for high-dimensional quantile regression are employed. The realized systemic risk beta corresponds to the total effect of each firm’s VaR on the system’s VaR. Using data on major financial institutions in the U.S. and in Europe, it is shown that the new measure is a valuable tool to both estimate and forecast systemic risk.",gnd:4121590-4 gnd:4323724-1 gnd:4139135-4 gnd:4339273-8
The regulation of septins in ciliogenesis and septin functions beyond the diffusion barrier,"Abstract: Primary cilia are fundamentally important organelles involved in organ development, signaling pathways and cancer. The septin family of small GTP-binding proteins have been linked to cilia and ciliopathies but their function in ciliogenesis remains elusive. A detailed understanding of the process of cilia formation is critical for therapeutic approaches in the future.<br>This thesis demonstrated that cilia formation depends on the presence and dynamics of septins. Knockdown of septins and the inhibition of septin dynamics via forchlorfenuron (FCF) resulted in significantly decreased ciliogenesis. In addition, septins were visualized at the base of primary cilia or along the full length of the axoneme. <br>In the first part, it was shown that septins are regulated by the Rho GTPases Cdc42 and TC10 via their downstream effectors of the Borg family. Here it was shown that septin filaments associate with Borg proteins in the cytoskeleton as well as within cilia. Dominant active and negative Cdc42 inhibit cilia formation indicating that the free cycling of Cdc42 between its active and inactive state is essential for Borg and septin regulation during ciliogenesis. Even though Cdc42 and TC10 are close homologues, their functions during ciliogenesis are not redundant. The expression of dominant active TC10 inhibited cilia formation, whereas dominant negative TC10 had no influence on ciliogenesis. Knockdown experiments demonstrated that Cdc42 is essential for ciliogenesis but TC10 is not. Also the double knockdown of Cdc42 and TC10 showed no additive effect on ciliogenesis. However, an influence of TC10 on ciliary length was detected. Moreover, two distinct cellular distributions at cilia were observed: active Cdc42 was predominantly located as a spot at the base whereas a TC10 accumulation surrounded the base of cilia, suggesting different functions during ciliogenesis.<br>The second part demonstrated that septins are involved in exocytotic processes during ciliogenesis. Septins colocalize with the exocyst complex at the base of cilia. Rab10 vesicles were shown to accumulate at the base of cilia and to colocalize with septins. GST pull-down experiments revealed that septins interact with Rab10, independent of the nucleotide-binding state. Knockdown experiments revealed that Rab10 is important for cilia formation. Moreover, the inhibition of septin dynamics via FCF hindered the traffic of a cilia-targeted protein to the cilium. <br>This thesis investigate ...",gnd:4190826-0 gnd:1143854551 gnd:4289693-9
Biomineralization capabilities of streptomyces mirabilis P16B-1 : insights into struvite and nickel-struvite synthesis and their implications,"Microorganisms thriving in extreme environments have evolved remarkable strategies to cope with harsh conditions, often presenting significant biotechnological potential. Former mining sites, known for their high concentrations of heavy metals and low pH, provide an extreme environment for microbial adaptation. Streptomyces mirabilis P16B-1 was previously isolated from a former uranium mine near Ronneburg, Germany. This strain presents high tolerance to nickel and other heavy metals along with the ability to produce biominerals. The objective of this research was to elucidate the underlying mechanism behind this process. The mineral produced by S. mirabilis P16B-1 was identified as struvite. In the presence of nickel, this metal is incorporated into the mineral structure, forming Ni-struvite. The biomineralization of struvite occurs with limited control by the bacterium over the process. Mineral precipitation was induced due to the increasing concentration of ammonium in the vicinity of the cell as a result of metabolic activity and consequent rise in the pH, thus increasing the supersaturation of the mineral. Moreover, the activity of the nickel exporter NreB in the presence of nickel results in an increased concentration of this metal near the cell, thereby increasing the supersaturation of Ni-struvite. Analyses of the metabolome and secretome of the strain revealed the involvement of organic molecules in the mineralization process. The precipitation of struvite provides advantages to the bacterium, such as immobilization of nutrients like nitrogen and phosphate, which can later be solubilized by the bacterium. Additionally, the precipitation of Ni-struvite adds to the extreme tolerance of this bacterium by immobilizing the metal extracellularly, which also benefits other microorganisms in the environment. This ability to immobilize nickel, coupled with its involvement in nutrient cycling, positions S. mirabilis P16B-1 as an important member of the soil community.",gnd:4611954-1 gnd:4145644-0

To study histidine phosphorylation, a newly developed NMR approach, the HNP experiment, is presented in this thesis. The HNP experiment provides speci c experimental evidence of phosphorylated histidines in proteins. It allows for the determination of the regiochemistry of phosphohistidines on the basis of three individual peak patterns for distinguishing all three phosphohistidines i.e. 1- and 3-phosphohistidine and 1,3-diphosphohistidine. This novel NMR approach allows the investigation of histidine phosphorylation in proteins under physiological conditions without resorting to chemical shift comparisons, reference compounds, or radioactively labelled phosphate. In this thesis, histidine phosphorylation in the regulatory domains PRDI and PRDII of the Bacillus subtilis antiterminator protein GlcT was intensely studied. GlcT is a transcription factor, which regulates the phosphotransferase system (PTS) by modulating the expression level of PTS-enzymes (Enzyme I, HPr, Enzyme II) on a transcriptional level.

Entscheidungsfindung in der humanitären Logistik : ein multikriterielles Transshipmentmodell zur Allokation von Hilfsgütern in laufenden Hilfsaktionen,"['Humanitarian relief operations rarely proceed smoothly and disruptions as, e.g., the outbreak of an epidemic or aftershocks, are common. Such situations are known as overlapping disasters. Relief organizations have to deal with the disruptions while at the same time the ongoing relief operation has to proceed. As future developments are uncertain, the aim cannot be to determine a unique optimal solution. Rather, various scenarios are formulated, representing possible developments of the situation. A multi-objective transshipment model is formulated to find efficient allocations of relief items for different scenarios. The model mHumLog is solved by two solution methods both considering uncertainties about future developments. Different indicators are developed for evaluating the scenarios in order to find appropriate decision rules to support the aid worker in allocating relief items.', 'Nur selten verlaufen Operationen der humanitären Hilfe gradlinig.

Structural optimization of components and joints in assemblies considering fail-safety,"['Structural optimization has become an increasingly important part of product development, especially in the aerospace industry, where weight savings due to lightweight design have a particularly strong impact on efficiency and thus economy and environmental compatibility. One area of structural optimization is topology optimization, which offers maximum design freedom and thus enables the greatest improvements. However, load-adapted designs obtained by topology optimization are usually highly sensitive to an unpredictable local loss of stiffness, like e.g. for the case of randomly inflicted damage to individual load paths of the structure. Therefore, these designs are not considered fail-safe. This thesis presents a two-stage procedure for density-based optimization towards a fail-safe design. Existing approaches are either computationally extremely expensive or do not explicitly consider fail-safe requirements in the optimization. The presented method trades off both aspects by employing a two-stage optimization approach to provide redundant designs that offer robustness to the failure of single load paths. In the first stage, a topology optimization with local volume constraints is performed. The second stage is referred to as ""density-based shape optimization"" since it only alters the outline of the structure while still acting on a fixed voxel-type finite element mesh with pseudo-densities assigned to each element. The performance gain and computational efficiency of the proposed method are demonstrated by application to various 2D and 3D examples. The results show, that the presented method can be carried out with reasonable computational effort, in contrast to existing approaches with explicit consideration of fail-safety in topology optimization. For the 2D examples considered, the number of analyses for a fail-safe optimization is reduced by three orders of magnitude compared to existing methods and is at most 5.6 times higher than for a standard topology optimization. Consequently, the proposed method is also applicable for large-scale models in an industrial context. With the possibility to compute and manufacture single optimized components, the question of how to optimize the connections between different components in an assembly arises. This thesis therefore also provides a method for the simultaneous optimization of the topology of components and their corresponding joint locations in an assembly. Therein, the joint locations are not discrete and predefined, but continuously movable. The underlying coupling equations allow for connecting dissimilar meshes and avoid the need for remeshing when joint locations change. The presented method models the force transfer at a joint location not only by using single spring elements but accounts for the size and type of the joints. When considering e.g. riveted or bolted joints, the local part geometry at the joint location consists of matching holes that are surrounded by material. For spot welds, the joint locations are filled with material and may be smaller than for bolts. The presented method incorporates these material and clearance zones into the simultaneously running topology optimization of the components. Furthermore, failure of joints may be taken into account at the optimization stage, yielding assemblies connected in a fail-safe manner. Finally, by embedding the above-mentioned efficient method for fail-safe optimization of single components in the presented assembly optimization framework, damage tolerant assemblies can be obtained that are robust to the failure of joints and single load paths of each component.', 'Die Strukturoptimierung ist ein zunehmend wichtiger Bestandteil der Produktentwicklung geworden, vor allem in der Luft- und Raumfahrt, wo sich Gewichtseinsparungen durch Leichtbau besonders stark auf die Effizienz und damit auf die Wirtschaftlichkeit und Umweltverträglichkeit auswirken. Ein Gebiet der Strukturoptimierung ist die Topologieoptimierung, die maximale Gestaltungsfreiheit bietet und damit die größten Verbesserungen ermöglicht. Lastangepasste Entwürfe aus einer Topologieoptimierung sind allerdings in der Regel sehr empfindlich gegenüber einem unvorhersehbaren lokalen Steifigkeitsverlust, etwa durch zufällig auftretende Schäden an einzelnen Lastpfaden der Struktur. Diese Entwürfe gelten daher nicht als ausfallsicher. In dieser Arbeit wird ein zweistufiges Verfahren zur dichtebasierten Optimierung von ausfallsicheren Bauteilen vorgestellt. Bestehende Methoden sind entweder extrem rechenintensiv oder berücksichtigen die Anforderungen an die Ausfallsicherheit nicht explizit in der Optimierung. Der vorgestellte Ansatz stellt einen Kompromiss zwischen beiden Vorgehensweisen dar, indem er mit Hilfe einer zweistufigen Optimierung redundante Entwürfe liefert, die robust gegenüber dem Ausfall einzelner Lastpfade sind. In der ersten Stufe wird eine Topologieoptimierung mit lokalen Volumennebenbedingungen durchgeführt. Die zweite Stufe wird als ""dichtebasierte Formoptimierung"" bezeichnet, da sie nur die Umrisse der Struktur verändert, die weiterhin durch Pseudodichten in einem voxelartigen Finite-Elemente-Netz beschrieben ist. Die erzielbaren Verbesserungen und der damit verbundene Rechenaufwand durch Anwendung der vorgeschlagenen Methode werden anhand verschiedener 2D- und 3D-Beispiele demonstriert. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die vorgestellte Methode im Gegensatz zu bestehenden Methoden mit expliziter Berücksichtigung von Ausfallsicherheit in der Topologieoptimierung mit vertretbarem Rechenaufwand durchgeführt werden kann. Für die gezeigten 2D-Beispiele verringert sich so etwa die Gesamtzahl der Rechnungen für eine Optimierung hinsichtlich Ausfallsicherheit um drei Größenordnungen und ist maximal 5,6-mal höher als bei einer gewöhnlichen Topologieoptimierung. Das unterstreicht, dass die vorgestellte Methode auch für große Modelle im industriellen Kontext anwendbar ist. Mit der Möglichkeit einzelne optimierte Komponenten zu berechnen und herzustellen ergibt sich auch die Frage, wie die Verbindungen zwischen verschiedenen Komponenten in einer Baugruppe optimiert werden können. In dieser Arbeit wird daher zudem auch eine Methode zur gleichzeitigen Optimierung der Topologie von Bauteilen und deren Verbindungen in Baugruppen vorgestellt. Dabei ist die Lage der Verbindungsstellen weder diskret noch vorgeschrieben, sondern kontinuierlich beweglich. Kopplungsgleichungen ermöglichen den Einsatz unterschiedlich vernetzter Entwurfsräume und umgehen eine Neuvernetzung, wenn sich die Positionen der Verbinder ändern. In der vorgestellten Methode ist die Kraftübertragung an einer Verbindungsstelle nicht nur durch einzelne Federelemente modelliert, sondern es werden auch die Größe und Art der Verbindung berücksichtigt. Für Niet- oder Schraubverbindungen müssen beispielsweise lokal an den Bauteilen entsprechende passgenaue Löcher, umgeben von Material, vorhanden sein. Punktschweißungen hingegen können kleiner ausfallen und erfordern nur das Vorhandensein von Material. Die vorgestellte Methode bezieht diese Material- und Freibereiche in die gleichzeitig laufende Topologieoptimierung der Bauteile mit ein. Darüber hinaus kann das Versagen von Verbindern schon während der Optimierung berücksichtigt werden, so dass sich ausfallsicher verbundene Baugruppen ergeben. Durch die Einbettung der effizienten Methode zur ausfallsicheren Optimierung von Einzelkomponenten in die vorgestellte Baugruppenoptimierung können schließlich schadenstolerante Baugruppen errechnet werden, die robust gegenüber einem Ausfall von Verbindern sowie von Lastpfaden der einzelnen Komponenten sind.']",gnd:4183811-7

Isolation of DNA from unprocessed and processed wood of Dipterocarpaceae,"Forest destruction and degradation (deforestation) remain major threats to the global biodiversity and cause enormous environmental damage in particular in tropical regions, where the highest density of species is accommodated. One third of global deforestation was caused by logging, in which more than 50% was illegally done (Brack, 2003). Dipterocarpaceae (dipterocarpsʺ) is a species-rich tree family distributed over the tropical belt of three continents of South America, Africa and Asia. Dipterocarps predominate the international tropical timber market (trade names: meranti, balau for Shorea spp., keruing for Dipterocarpus spp., kapur for Dryobalanops, etc.), and therefore play an important role in the economy of many Southeast Asian countries. However, in many regions dipterocarps are critically endangered due to forest destruction and non-sustainable forest management. Many activities have been initiated by government or non-government organizations to fight illegal logging. Several associations of wood-product manufacturers have released policy statements, in which member companies are committed to sourcing their wood or timber from legal and well-managed forests.

Improving RDF data with data mining,"Linked Open Data (LOD) comprises very many and often large public data sets and knowledge bases. Those datasets are mostly presented in the RDF triple structure of subject, predicate, and object, where each triple represents a statement or fact. Unfortunately, the heterogeneity of available open data requires significant integration steps before it can be used in applications. Meta information, such as ontological definitions and exact range definitions of predicates, are desirable and ideally provided by an ontology. However in the context of LOD, ontologies are often incomplete or simply not available. Thus, it is useful to automatically generate meta information, such as ontological dependencies, range definitions, and topical classifications. Association rule mining, which was originally applied for sales analysis on transactional databases, is a promising and novel technique to explore such data.

In the course of the first part of this study, extracts were collected from the bark by successive Soxhlet extraction with dichloro methane (DCM), methanol and water. Then the natural polyester suberin was extracted with a rather low yield (3.7 ±0.9 wt.%) from the remaining extract-free bark by methanolysis. The extracts and the predominantly aliphatic suberin monomers were investigated using the analytical methods of Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS), Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, Fourier-Transform InfraRed (FTIR) spectroscopy, UltraViolet–Visible spectroscopy, Elemental Analysis, Thermal Gravimetric Analysis and Differential Scanning Calorimetry. The DCM extract was found to consist of ""waxes"", which were primarily composed of phenolic compounds as well as long-chain alkanes with either no functionalization or simple mono functionalization, and therefore this extract was not suitable for polymerization.

Eine Methode der effizienten und verifizierbaren Programmannotation für den Transport von Escape-Informationen,"JIT compilation is frequently employed in order to speedup the execution of platform-independent and dynamically extensible mobile code applications. Since the time required for dynamic compilation directly influences a program's execution time, JIT compilers usually utilize only simple and fast techniques for program analysis and optimization. Program annotations can be used to improve the analysis and optimizitation process of a JIT compiler. Program annotations allow a mobile code system derive information about a program, on the producer side, and transmit that information along with the program to the consumer side. In this work, we present an inherently safe annotation technique for the safe transmission of escape information. The annotation technique described in this work is built on the SafeTSA mobile code format and is implemented as a simple extension of SafeTSA's type system.

Such an understanding is critical for engineers and scientists developing new materials with higher strength and toughness, developing robust designs against failure, or for those concerned with an accurate estimate of a component's design life. Defects like cracks and dislocations evolve at nano scales and influence the macroscopic properties such as strength, toughness and ductility of a material. In engineering applications, the global response of the system is often governed by the behaviour at the smaller length scales. Hence, the sub-scale behaviour must be computed accurately for good predictions of the full scale behaviour. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations promise to reveal the fundamental mechanics of material failure by modeling the atom to atom interactions. Since the atomistic dimensions are of the order of Angstroms ( A), approximately 85 billion atoms are required to model a 1 micro- m^3 volume of Copper. Therefore, pure atomistic models are prohibitively expensive with everyday engineering computations involving macroscopic cracks and shear bands, which are much larger than the atomistic length and time scales. To reduce the computational effort, multiscale methods are required, which are able to couple a continuum description of the structure with an atomistic description. In such paradigms, cracks and dislocations are explicitly modeled at the atomistic scale, whilst a self-consistent continuum model elsewhere. Many multiscale methods for fracture are developed for ""fictitious"" materials based on ""simple"" potentials such as the Lennard-Jones potential. Moreover, multiscale methods for evolving cracks are rare. Efficient methods to coarse grain the fine scale defects are missing. However, the existing multiscale methods for fracture do not adaptively adjust the fine scale domain as the crack propagates. Most methods, therefore only ""enlarge"" the fine scale domain and therefore drastically increase computational cost. Adaptive adjustment requires the fine scale domain to be refined and coarsened. One of the major difficulties in multiscale methods for fracture is to up-scale fracture related material information from the fine scale to the coarse scale, in particular for complex crack problems. Most of the existing approaches therefore were applied to examples with comparatively few macroscopic cracks. Key contributions The bridging scale method is enhanced using the phantom node method so that cracks can be modeled at the coarse scale. To ensure self-consistency in the bulk, a virtual atom cluster is devised providing the response of the intact material at the coarse scale. A molecular statics model is employed in the fine scale where crack propagation is modeled by naturally breaking the bonds. The fine scale and coarse scale models are coupled by enforcing the displacement boundary conditions on the ghost atoms. An energy criterion is used to detect the crack tip location. Adaptive refinement and coarsening schemes are developed and implemented during the crack propagation. The results were observed to be in excellent agreement with the pure atomistic simulations. The developed multiscale method is one of the first adaptive multiscale method for fracture. A robust and simple three dimensional coarse graining technique to convert a given atomistic region into an equivalent coarse region, in the context of multiscale fracture has been developed. The developed method is the first of its kind. The developed coarse graining technique can be applied to identify and upscale the defects like: cracks, dislocations and shear bands. The current method has been applied to estimate the equivalent coarse scale models of several complex fracture patterns arrived from the pure atomistic simulations. The upscaled fracture pattern agree well with the actual fracture pattern. The error in the potential energy of the pure atomistic and the coarse grained model was observed to be acceptable. A first novel meshless adaptive multiscale method for fracture has been developed. The phantom node method is replaced by a meshless differential reproducing kernel particle method. The differential reproducing kernel particle method is comparatively more expensive but allows for a more ""natural"" coupling between the two scales due to the meshless interpolation functions. The higher order continuity is also beneficial. The centro symmetry parameter is used to detect the crack tip location. The developed multiscale method is employed to study the complex crack propagation. Results based on the meshless adaptive multiscale method were observed to be in excellent agreement with the pure atomistic simulations. The developed multiscale methods are applied to study the fracture in practical materials like Graphene and Graphene on Silicon surface. The bond stretching and the bond reorientation were observed to be the net mechanisms of the crack growth in Graphene. The influence of time step on the crack propagation was studied using two different time steps. Pure atomistic simulations of fracture in Graphene on Silicon surface are presented. Details of the three dimensional multiscale method to study the fracture in Graphene on Silicon surface are discussed.",gnd:4126904-4 gnd:4121051-7 gnd:7600619-0
Identifizierung und Charakterisierung der vom Phosphoproteingen des Newcastle Disease Virus kodierten akzessorischen Proteine W und V,"['Like other members of the Paramyxoviridae, NDV enlarges its coding capacity by differential editing of transcripts. Due to co-transcriptional mRNA-editing the phosphoprotein gene encodes the phospho- (P), V-, and W protein. The three proteins share a common N-terminus but specify C-termini differing in length and amino acid composition. Whereas the expression and incorporation into NDV particles has been demonstrated for NDV P- and V proteins, evidence for the existence of a W protein was lacking. W-specific antipeptide sera were generated to analyze expression of the NDV W protein based on peptides located in the unique C-terminal W protein amino acid sequence that encompassed predicted antigenic sites. The corresponding rabbit sera enabled the detection of plasmid-expressed W protein as well as W protein expression during infection by indirect immunofluorescence and Western blot analyses. Incorporation of W protein into viral particles was indicated by Western blot and mass spectrometric analyses. In contrast, W protein was absent in infected cells and viral particles of newly generated recombinant NDV lacking W protein expression. Absence of W protein expression was achived by two different mutational approaches. Confocal microscopic analyses revealed a nuclear accumulation of W protein of NDV in infected cells, attributed to a bipartite nuclear localization sequence within its unique C-terminal part.

Electrochemical sodium storage in non-graphitizing carbons - insights into mechanisms and synthetic approaches towards high-energy density materials,"To achieve a sustainable energy economy, it is necessary to turn back on the combustion of fossil fuels as a means of energy production and switch to renewable sources. However, their temporal availability does not match societal consumption needs, meaning that renewably generated energy must be stored in its main generation times and allocated during peak consumption periods. Electrochemical energy storage (EES) in general is well suited due to its infrastructural independence and scalability. The lithium ion battery (LIB) takes a special place, among EES systems due to its energy density and efficiency, but the scarcity and uneven geological occurrence of minerals and ores vital for many cell components, and hence the high and fluctuating costs will decelerate its further distribution.

Therefore, the plasmonic nanoparticles such as gold and silver nanoparticles act as nano-reactors, where the molecules attached to their surfaces benefit from the enhanced electromagnetic field along with the generated energetic charge carriers and heat for possible chemical transformations. Hence, plasmonic chemistry presents metal nanoparticles as a unique playground for chemical reactions on the nanoscale remotely controlled by light.

The Cauchy problem for the linearised Einstein equation and the Goursat problem for wave equations,"In this thesis, we study two initial value problems arising in general relativity. The first is the Cauchy problem for the linearised Einstein equation on general globally hyperbolic spacetimes, with smooth and distributional initial data. We extend well-known results by showing that given a solution to the linearised constraint equations of arbitrary real Sobolev regularity, there is a globally defined solution, which is unique up to addition of gauge solutions. Two solutions are considered equivalent if they differ by a gauge solution. Our main result is that the equivalence class of solutions depends continuously on the corre- sponding equivalence class of initial data. We also solve the linearised constraint equations in certain cases and show that there exist arbitrarily irregular (non-gauge) solutions to the linearised Einstein equation on Minkowski spacetime and Kasner spacetime.

Relativistic interaction of ultra-short laser pulses with nanostructured solids,"Generation of hot and dense plasmas under relativistic interaction of ultra-intense high-contrast femtosecond laser pulses with solid targets is among the most exciting research topics in high energy density physics. Such plasmas would be also extremely beneficial for the area of astrophysics and nuclear physics, for the development of the efficient sources of hard-X-ray radiation. Nanophotonics opens a new chapter in this research. It was recently argued that nanowire arrays used as targets allow a larger penetration depth of the laser energy to a μm-scale leading to the volumetric plasma heating. As a result of the very efficient laser energy absorption, electron densities of 1023-1024 cm-3 with multi-keV temperatures can be reached. However, this relatively new field research is still poorly understood, while no thorough comparative studies of the interaction with flat and nanostructured solids have been conducted. This thesis investigates the influence of the target morphology on the plasma parameters and produced hard X-ray emission in different regimes of interaction. The potential of the nanowires has been studied in a number of experiments with a focus on X-ray spectroscopy techniques. Besides the commonly used approach utilizing short-wavelength laser pulses (UV, visible or near-IR spectral range) for the production of laser-induced plasmas, a novel regime of interaction with long-wavelength pulses (mid-IR) has been investigated. The performed analysis of the measured X-ray spectra together with the Particle-In-Cell code and FLYCHK (collisional radiative code) simulations have shown that the plasma dynamics in the case of the nanowire and flat targets are strikingly different. This results in the effective heating of the plasma volume. It has been demonstrated that the nanowire morphology provides a possibility to generate a larger volume of hot dense plasmas at the given laser pulse parameters.",gnd:4222149-3 gnd:4707308-1 gnd:4204530-7 gnd:4129728-3 gnd:4046249-3 gnd:4338132-7 gnd:4129534-1 gnd:4148259-1

"Expanding the ancient DNA bioinformatics toolbox, and its applications to archeological microbiomes","The 1980s were very prolific years not only for music, but also for molecular biology and genetics, with the first publications on the microbiome and ancient DNA. Several technical revolutions later, the field of ancient metagenomics is now progressing full steam ahead, at a never seen before pace. While generating sequencing data is becoming cheaper every year, the bioinformatics methods and the compute power needed to analyze them are struggling to catch up. In this thesis, I propose new methods to reduce the sequencing to analysis gap, by introducing scalable and parallelized softwares for ancient DNA metagenomics analysis. In manuscript A, I first introduce a method for estimating the mixtures of different sources in a sequencing sample, a problem known as source tracking. I then apply this method to predict the original sources of paleofeces in manuscript B. In manuscript C, I propose a new method to scale the lowest common ancestor calling from sequence alignment files, which brings a solution for the computational intractability of fitting ever growing metagenomic reference database indices in memory. In manuscript D, I present a method to statistically estimate in parallel the ancient DNA deamination damage, and test it in the context of de novo assembly. Finally, in manuscript E, I apply some of the methods developed in this thesis to the analyis of ancient wine fermentation samples, and present the first ancient genomes of ancient fermentation bacteria.

Crab flare observations with H.E.S.S. phase II,"The H.E.S.S. array is a third generation Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope (IACT) array. It is located in the Khomas Highland in Namibia, and measures very high energy (VHE) gamma-rays. In Phase I, the array started data taking in 2004 with its four identical 13 m telescopes. Since then, H.E.S.S. has emerged as the most successful IACT experiment to date. Among the almost 150 sources of VHE gamma-ray radiation found so far, even the oldest detection, the Crab Nebula, keeps surprising the scientific community with unexplained phenomena such as the recently discovered very energetic flares of high energy gamma-ray radiation. During its most recent flare, which was detected by the Fermi satellite in March 2013, the Crab Nebula was simultaneously observed with the H.E.S.S. array for six nights. The results of the observations will be discussed in detail during the course of this work. During the nights of the flare, the new 24 m × 32 m H.E.S.S.

An abstraction framework for tangible interactive surfaces,"This cumulative dissertation discusses - by the example of four subsequent publications - the various layers of a tangible interaction framework, which has been developed in conjunction with an electronic musical instrument with a tabletop tangible user interface.

Multi-Algorithmen-Rendering : Darstellung heterogener 3-D-Szenen in Echtzeit : Real-time 3D rendering of heterogeneous scenes,"['Many large virtual 3D scenes are not structured evenly, for example because they exhibit a highly varying density distribution of their polygons. For such heterogeneous data, there is no single algorithm that constantly performs well with any type of scene and that is able to render the scene at each position fast with the same high image quality. For a small set of scenes, this situation can be improved, if an experienced user is able to manually assign different rendering algorithms to particular parts of the scene. We introduce the Multi- Algorithm-Rendering method which automatically deploys different rendering algorithms simultaneously for a broad range of scene types. The method divides the scene into suitable subregions and measures the behavior of the different algorithms for each region in a preprocessing step. During runtime, this data is utilized to compute an estimate for the quality and running time of the available rendering algorithms from the observers point of view. By solving an optimizing problem embedded in a control cycle, the image quality can be optimized by the appropriate assignment of algorithms to regions, while keeping the achieved frame rate almost constant. In an experimental evaluation, we compare our methods running time and image quality with that of standard rendering algorithms.', 'Viele große virtuelle 3-D-Szenen sind nicht gleichmäßig strukturiert, z.

Exploring the Architecture of Transiting Exoplanetary Systems with High-Precision Photometry,"['This thesis develops and establishes several methods to determine the detailed geometric architecture of transiting exoplanetary systems (planets orbiting around, and periodically passing in front of, stars other than the sun) using high-precision photometric data collected by the Kepler space telescope. It highlights the measurement of stellar obliquity – the tilt of the stellar equator with respect to the planetary orbital plane(s) – and presents methods for more precise obliquity measurements in individual systems of particular interest, as well as for measurements in systems that have been out of reach of previous methods. Such information is useful for investigating the dynamical evolution of the planetary orbit, which is the key to understanding the diverse architecture of exoplanetary systems.

Development of a downscaling scheme for a coarse scale soil water estimation method : case study Great Letaba River in South Africa,"Many river basins worldwide, especially in semi-arid regions, are adversely impacted by poor hydrological infrastructure or are poorly characterized due to limited or no hydrologic data. This condition challenges water-management authorities, who benefit from reliable prediction of the hydrological dynamics that can be made by means of hydrological models. Because of the lack of sufficient or reliable data, often such models are difficult to calibrate and to validate. This study addresses this data limitation by formulating and testing an independent validation tool for hydrological models that can be applied to downscale macro-scale soil water data derived from a remotely sensed scatterometer dataset. This proposed method uses the concept of hydrological response units (HRU) to analyze the spatial variability within one scatterometer footprint. The HRUs are treated as model entities in the process oriented hydrological model J2000 that was applied to the Great Letaba River catchment (ca. 4.700 kmø) in South Africa. The soil water time series results were then compared to the remotely sensed data set and the downscaling scheme derived.",gnd:4236526-0 gnd:4137761-8 gnd:4498176-4

The effect of groundwater on benthic primary producers and their interaction,"In littoral zones of lakes, multiple processes determine lake ecology and water quality. Lacustrine groundwater discharge (LGD), most frequently taking place in littoral zones, can transport or mobilize nutrients from the sediments and thus contribute significantly to lake eutrophication. Furthermore, lake littoral zones are the habitat of benthic primary producers, namely submerged macrophytes and periphyton, which play a key role in lake food webs and influence lake water quality. Groundwater-mediated nutrient-influx can potentially affect the asymmetric competition between submerged macrophytes and periphyton for light and nutrients. While rooted macrophytes have superior access to sediment nutrients, periphyton can negatively affect macrophytes by shading. LGD may thus facilitate periphyton production at the expense of macrophyte production, although studies on this hypothesized effect are missing. The research presented in this thesis is aimed at determining how LGD influences periphyton, macrophytes, and the interactions ...",gnd:4140346-0
Identifizierung aktiver und enantioselektiver Hydrolasen für den industriellen Einsatz,"['Of all the types of enzyme-catalyzed reactions in organic synthesis, hydrolytic transformations are the easiest to perform. Hydrolases accept a broad range of substrates, exhibit high stability and cofactors are not required. Since the number of commercially available biocatalysts is raising steadily, in this thesis model substrates (secondary alcohols) are used to develop and evaluate assay systems for the fast and reliable identification of active and enantioselective Hydrolases. Under technical conditions the characterization of selected enzymes often shows, that their properties are not satisfying for the generation of profitable processes. By substrate- and medium-engineering, respectively, immobilization and the improvement of an enzyme by directed evolution it is possible to increase the effectiveness of a biocatalytic process, especially with respect to the enantioselectivity. The generation of a mutant library is performed by the classical method of directed evolution by error-prone PCR.

It also describes the electronic structure of intermolecular charge transfer excitons correlated to molecular orientation in solids. It has long been known that molecular orientation influences the electrical and optical properties of molecular films. One notable example is in liquid crystals where rigid rod or disk shaped molecules are commonly used. Understanding the origin of the molecular orientation and its control by surface treatment and electric field resulted in the development of liquid crystal displays. The same thing has happened in organic electronics, and considerable effort has been devoted to understanding and controlling molecular orientation in solid films to improve charge carrier mobility and light absorption, ultimately to improve the performance of organic solar cells and thin film transistors. In contrast, less attention has been paid to molecular orientation and its influence on the characteristics of OLEDs, probably because of the use of amorphous films rather than micro-crystalline films, and it is only in recent years that some molecular films are known to have preferred orientation. This thesis addresses this topic, focusing on OLEDs, describing the origin and control of the orientation of phosphorescent Ir complexes possessing spherical shape rather than rod or disk shape, the simulation of the optical characteristics of OLEDs influenced by preferred molecular orientation, and finally the orientation of intermolecular charge transfer excitons and its correlation to electronic structures in thin films']",gnd:4218979-2 gnd:4223130-9 gnd:4170370-4 gnd:4203832-7 gnd:4136925-7 gnd:4016091-9 gnd:4148259-1 gnd:4151823-8 gnd:4047979-1 gnd:4762455-3

But it was forgotten for nearly 30 years. Recently, Ringel showed ([28], [27]) in some way the Gabriel-Roiter measure provides a foundation for representation theory of artin algebras. The Gabriel-Roiter filtration and the Gabriel-Roiter submodule play an important role in the topic. So-called Gabriel-Roiter submodules of an indecomposable module are indecomposable submodules with a certain maximality: there do not exist proper indecomposable submodules containing a Gabriel-Roiter submodule.

3d virtual histology of neuronal tissue by propagation-based x-ray phase-contrast tomograpyh,"Deciphering the three-dimensional (3d) cytoarchitecture of neuronal tissue is an important step towards understanding the connection between tissue function and structure and determining relevant changes in neurodegenerative diseases. The gold standard in pathology is histology, in which the tissue is examined under a light microscope after serial sectioning and subsequent staining. It is an invasive and labor-intensive technique which is prone to artifacts due to the slicing procedure. While it provides excellent results on the 2d slices, the 3d anatomy can only be determined after aligning the individual sections, leading to a non-isotropic resolution within the tissue. X-ray computed tomography (CT) offers a promising alternative due to its potential resolution and large penetration depth which allows for non-invasive imaging of the sample's 3d density distribution. In classical CT, contrast formation is based on absorption of the x-rays as they pass through the sample. However, weakly absorbing samples like soft tissue from the central nervous system give nearly no contrast. By exploiting the much stronger phase shifts for contrast formation, which the sample induces in a (partially) coherent wavefront, it can be substantially increased. During free-space propagation behind the sample, these phase shifts are converted to a measurable intensity image by interference of the disturbed wave fronts. In this thesis, 3d virtual histology is performed by means of propagation-based x-ray phase-contrast tomography on tissue from the central nervous system of humans and mice. A combination of synchrotron-based and laboratory setups is used to visualize the 3d density distribution on varying lengths scales from the whole organ down to single cells. By comparing and optimizing different preparation techniques and phase-retrieval approaches, even sub-cellular resolution can be reached in mm-sized tissue blocks. The development of an automatic cell segmentation workflow provides access to the 3d cellular distribution within the tissue, enabling the quantification of the cellular arrangement and allowing for extensive statistical analysis based on several thousands to millions of cells. This paves the way for biomedical studies aimed at changes in cellular distribution, e.g., in the course of neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or ischemic stroke.",gnd:4019752-9 gnd:4113240-3 gnd:4025092-1 gnd:4038639-9 gnd:4169148-9 gnd:4041649-5 gnd:4756133-6 gnd:4171594-9 gnd:4321722-9

Molekulare Analyse des Kernfreisetzungskomplexes des Pseudorabies Virus,"['Herpesviruses use a vesicle-mediated transport for translocation of nucleocapsids from the nucleus to the cytoplasm for final virus maturation. Two conserved herpesviral proteins, designated as pUL34 and pUL31, form the nuclear egress complex, which is required for efficient nuclear egress. The crystal structures of NECs from different herpesviruses showed a tight interaction of the N-terminal domain of pUL31 forming a hook-like extension clamping the core of pUL34. Furthermore the most conserved residues of pUL31 belong to a zinc finger motif (ZNF). To clarify the functional importance of the ZNF motif in PrV pUL31, which consists of three cysteines (C73, C89 and C92) contributed by the CR1 and a histidine (H188) from CR3, cysteines were individually substituted by serine residues, and the histidine H188 was replaced by an alanine. Functional analyses of the mutant proteins performed in vitro with artificial membranes and in situ in eukaryotic cells showed that the ZNF motif is an essential prerequisite for NEC formation and the membrane remodeling activity. The N-Terminus of the pUL31 homologs is variable and highly flexible and was therefore omitted in the constructs used for crystallization. Like several other pUL31 homologs PrV pUL31 contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS) in the N-terminus for efficient nuclear targeting.

The author focuses on a particular quantity called the superconformal index (SCI), which is defined by considering the theories on the product space of two spheres and circles, in order to clarify the validity of so-called three-dimensional mirror symmetry, one of the famous duality proposals. In addition to a review of known results, the author presents a new definition of SCI by considering theories on the product space of real-projective space and circles. In this book, he explains the concept of SCI from the point of view of quantum mechanics and gives localization computations by reducing field theoretical computations to many-body quantum mechanics. He applies his new results of SCI with real-projective space to test three-dimensional mirror symmetry, one of the dualities of quantum field theory. Real-projective space is known to be an unorientable surface like the Mobius strip, and there are many exotic effects resulting from Z2 holonomy of the surface. Thanks to these exotic structures, his results provide completely new evidence of three-dimensional mirror symmetry. The equivalence expected from three-dimensional mirror symmetry is transformed into a conjectural non-trivial mathematical identity through the new SCI, and he performs the proof of the identity using a q-binomial formula.']",gnd:4047984-5 gnd:4321722-9 gnd:4047982-1 gnd:4538605-5 gnd:4128574-8 gnd:4312574-8 gnd:4382353-1

Hadamard states for bosonic quantum field theory on globally hyperbolic spacetimes,"Quantum field theory on curved spacetimes is understood as a semiclassical approximation of some quantum theory of gravitation, which models a quantum field under the influence of a classical gravitational field, that is, a curved spacetime. The most remarkable effect predicted by this approach is the creation of particles by the spacetime itself, represented, for instance, by Hawking's evaporation of black holes or the Unruh effect. On the other hand, these aspects already suggest that certain cornerstones of Minkowski quantum field theory, more precisely a preferred vacuum state and, consequently, the concept of particles, do not have sensible counterparts within a theory on general curved spacetimes. Likewise, the implementation of covariance in the model has to be reconsidered, as curved spacetimes usually lack any non-trivial global symmetry. Whereas this latter issue has been resolved by introducing the paradigm of locally covariant quantum field theory (LCQFT), the absence of a reasonable concept for distinct vacuum and particle states on general curved spacetimes has become manifest even in the form of no-go-theorems.

Nature conservation evaluation of strictly protected forest reserves : an exemplary application in Germany,"Zusammenfassung: Strictly protected forest reserves (SPFRs) in which forests are allowed to develop naturally were the focus of this study. In these reserves human interventions are excluded and it is expected that native and site specific biodiversity will be higher than in managed forests. This is mainly due to the space and time made available in the SPFRs for the development of forest structure and dynamic processes. Very little primeval forest remains in Central Europe to halt the loss of biodiversity. Therefore an aim of the German national strategy to protect biodiversity is to set aside 5% of the existing forest area by 2020 where it will be allowed to develop naturally. To find out if the aim has been reached quantitatively and qualitatively it is not enough to just sum up the areas of all SPFRs in Germany. Therefore, the objective of this study was to develop a method that can qualitatively evaluate the capability of SPFRs to protect biodiversity on the national level and to evaluate the current SPFR system’s contribution to biodiversity protection. First a literature review was done which focused on conservation evaluations and the criteria and indicators that might be useful for evaluating unmanaged forest in Central Europe. Based on the review, a framework for the selection of criteria, covering the temporal, spatial and functional dimensions of biodiversity evaluation was established. The criteria and indicators best suitable to evaluate the SPFRs were carefully selected. Afterwards a nature conservation evaluation concept was developed to determine how effective existing SPFRs contribute to the protection of biodiversity. Furthermore, the identification of nature conservation targets was needed to do a complete evaluation of the prerequisites and to evaluate the contribution of SPFRs in Germany to protect biodiversity. Due to the criteria-wise evaluation and the evaluation of the conservation targets, gaps at different levels could be made visible and the effectiveness of the current SPFR system to conserve characteristic forest biodiversity was presented. The planning and selection of additional SPFRs based on the evaluation scheme can now be accomplished systematically and effectively",gnd:4053659-2 gnd:4841998-9

Quantum to classical crossover in cavity QED and optomechanical systems,"['Modern cavity QED and cavity optomechanical systems realize the interaction of light with mesoscopic devices, which exhibit discrete (atom-like) energy spectra or perform micromechanical motion. In this thesis we have studied the crossover from the quantum regime to the classical limit of two prototypical models, the Dicke model and the generic optomechanical model. The physical problems considered in this approach range from a ground state phase transition, its dynamical response to general nonequilibrium dynamics including Hamiltonian and driven dissipative chaotic motion. The classical limit of these models follows from the classical limit of at least one of its subsystems. The classical equations of motion result from the respective quantum equations through the application of the semiclassical approximation, i.e., the neglect of quantum correlations. The approach of the results from quantum mechanics to the prediction of the classical equations can be obtained by subsequently decreasing the respective scaling parameter. In order to obtain exact results we have utilized advanced numerical methods, e.g., the Lanczos diagonalization method for ground state calculations, the Kernel Polynomial Method for dynamical response functions, Chebyshev recursion for time propagation, and quantum state diffusion for open system dynamics. We have studied the quantum phase transition of the Dicke model in the classical oscillator limit.

Computational Studies on Functionalized ZnO Surfaces and Nanostructures,"ZnO, Functionalization, Nanostructures, Surface Chemistry, DFT, SCC-DFTB. - In this work, we have used computer simulations to investigate the effect of organic functionalization on ZnO surfaces and nanostructures. Density Functional Theory has been employed to study the interactions of ZnO surfaces with different organic groups, identifying stabilization mechanisms involved in each case and the most promising anchoring groups for ZnO functionalization. Additionally, a semi-empirical model for ZnO large scale simulations has been developed and validated by comparison against DFT calculations. The was successful in simulating Zn-containing bulk solids and molecular complexes, ZnO surfaces and nanostructures, and the adsorption of organic acids on (1010)-ZnO surfaces. We have also employed this model to characterize native defects in ZnO nanowires. Finally, we have demonstrated that the interaction of surface oxygen vacancies with organic acids may explain the suppression of photoluminescence anomalies observed for polymer coated ZnO nanowires.",gnd:4190864-8 gnd:4204530-7 gnd:4126166-5
Interferometry with Interacting Bose-Einstein Condensates in a Double-Well Potential,"['This thesis demonstrates a full Mach–Zehnder interferometer with interacting Bose–Einstein condensates confined on an atom chip. It relies on the coherent manipulation of atoms trapped in a magnetic double-well potential, for which the author developed a novel type of beam splitter. Particle-wave duality enables the construction of interferometers for matter waves, which complement optical interferometers in precision measurement devices, both for technological applications and fundamental tests. This requires the development of atom-optics analogues to beam splitters, phase shifters and recombiners. Particle interactions in the Bose–Einstein condensate lead to a nonlinearity, absent in photon optics. This is exploited to generate a non-classical state with reduced atom-number fluctuations inside the interferometer. This state is then used to study the interaction-induced dephasing of the quantum superposition. The resulting coherence times are found to be a factor of three longer than expected for coherent states, highlighting the potential of entanglement as a resource for quantum-enhanced metrology.', 'Introduction -- Theoretical Framework -- Experimental Setup and Techniques -- A Mach-Zehnder Interferometer for Trapped, Interacting Bose-Einstein Condensates -- Outlook: Bosonic Josephson Junctions Beyond the Two-Mode Approximation.']",gnd:7738854-9 gnd:4168432-1 gnd:4402897-0

Novel methods for mining and learning from data streams,"Die vorliegende Arbeit befasst sich mit dem Erwerb von Wissen durch Lernen aus nichtstationären Datenströmen. Ein Datenstrom besteht aus einer kontinuierlichen Folge von Datenobjekten, wobei sich Eigenschaften des datengenerierenden Prozesses im Laufe der Zeit ändern können. Sowohl die Kontinuität und Dynamik als auch die Nichtstationarität von Datenströmen gehen einher mit neuen Herausforderungen für Methoden des maschinellen Lernens.Zwei neue Methoden zum überwachten Lernen (Klassifikation und Regression) auf Datenströmen werden in der Arbeit vorgestellt: IBL-Streams und eFPT. IBLStreams ist ein instanzbasiertes Verfahren und als solches besonders gut geeignet, inkrementell zu lernen und sich adaptiv an Veränderungen des datengenerierenden Prozesses anzupassen, vor allem im Vergleich zu modellbasierten Ansätzen. Der zweite Ansatz, ""evolving Fuzzy Pattern Trees"" (eFPT), kombiniert Konzepte der Fuzzy-Logik mit der Flexibilität nichtlinearer Aggregationsfunktionen und der Ausdrucksstärke hierarchischer Strukturen, um interpretierbare Modelle in Form kompakter Bäume zu induzieren. Für diese sogenannten ""fuzzy pattern trees"" werden Lernverfahren entwickelt, die es ermöglichen, Bäume inkrementell zu lernen und an Veränderungen des Datenstroms anzupassen.Ein weiterer Beitrag der Arbeit ist ein experimenteller Ansatz, der darauf abzielt, eine wichtige Eigenschaft von Methoden zum Lernen auf Datenströmen zu untersuchen, nämlich die Fähigkeit, auf einen so genannten ""concept change"" zu reagieren. Hierunter versteht man eine plötzliche oder graduelle Änderung des datengenerierenden Prozesses, der in der Regel zu einer (temporären) Verschlechterung der Prädiktionsgüte führt. .... - In this thesis we elaborate on knowledge acquisition and learning from non-stationary data streams. A data stream is formed by consecutively arriving data examples, whose data generating process may change in the course of time. Both the cumulative and the non-stationary nature of the data within a stream create a challenge for traditional machine learning methods.Concentrating on adaptive supervised learning from data streams, we introduce two novel learning methods: IBLStreams and eFPT. IBLStreams is an instance-based learner that shows how instance-based learning approaches, compared to model-based approaches, are naturally incremental besides their inherent ability to adapt upon the occurrence of a concept change. Evolving fuzzy pattern trees (eFPTs) utilize the potential interpretability of the fuzzy logic concepts in inducing compact trees; the induced trees offer the tradeoff between compact interpretable models and generalization performance. eFPTs attempt to dynamically evolve the induced tree in order to reflect any change in the underlying data generating process.We also introduce ""recovery analysis"" as a new type of evaluation for adaptive supervised learners on data streams. It is an experimental protocol to assess the learner's ability to learn and recover after a concept change. The resulting recovery pattern of the learning method can be analyzed both graphically and numerically using recovery measures.Apart from the full supervision offered in the streams studied in the previous approaches, we also consider streams of events: such a stream contains temporal events emitted from instances under observation. For a given instance, the survival time is the time this instance spends in the study until experiencing the event of interest. ...",gnd:4802620-7 gnd:4410055-3

Third generation SUSY and t¯t +Z production : Searches using the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider,"This thesis describes searches for new particles predicted by the supersymmetry (SUSY) theory, a theory extending beyond the current  Standard Model of particle physics, using the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The thesis focuses on searches for stop and sbottom squarks, the SUSY partners of the top and bottom quarks, which are expected to be lighter than the partners of the first and second generation quarks and therefore good candidates for the first evidence of SUSY. It describes novel techniques for estimating  and rejecting the Standard-Model backgrounds to searches for these particles. It also includes an independent analysis seeking to constrain the Standard Model ttZ background process, which also represents the first ATLAS search for this rare process at the LHC.

Gold nanotriangles : from atoms to LSPR-based sensing,"The presented work guides through a thorny path from gold atoms to nanocrystals in triangular shape and their application as optical transducers in LSPR-based sensing. Gold nanotriangles possess unique physicochemical and optical properties offering a powerful platform for precise and sensitive analyte detection. However, their true potential can be fully realized only through meticulous optimization and understanding of the synthesis techniques for achieving high purity and quality in a productive, preferably automated, and sustainable manner. Starting with the optimization of colloidal synthesis by investigating its critical parameters and employing a microfluidic system, this study develops a highly efficient procedure to manufacture gold nanotriangles of high quality. Next, the surface of manufactured material is functionalized following a rational and versatile strategy, which offers flexibility in adapting it to a wide variety of samples. The performed ligand exchange enables determining the bulk refractive index sensitivity of gold nanotriangles and proves their potential for LSPR-based sensing.  Finally, the surface of gold nanospheres is utilized by LSPR-based sensing to investigate the adsorption of proteins in a comparative study with fluorescence spectroscopy, as a well-established method in this field. Comparing both techniques validates the applicability and accuracy of LSPR-based sensing for e.g. nanotoxicological studies. The shown technique is less prone to optical interferences and is more cost-effective, which is expected to promote its wider acceptance in the field of nanomedicine and nanosafety. In conclusion, the future incorporation of novel nanomaterials into the realm of LSPR-based sensing holds tremendous promise for expanding the horizons of molecular detection and biosensing using compact bioanalytical devices in the diversity of applications from point-of-care medical diagnostics to on-site environmental monitoring and beyond.",gnd:4367529-3

An early important contribution towards the optimization of numerical methods by means of special meshes was made by N.S. Bakhvalov in 1969. His paper spawned a lively discussion in the literature with a number of further meshes being proposed and applied to various singular perturbation problems. However, in the mid 1980s this development stalled, but was enlivend again by G.I. Shishkin's proposal of piecewise- equidistant meshes in the early 1990s. Because of their very simple structure they are often much easier to analyse than other meshes, although they give numerical approximations that are inferior to solutions on competing meshes. Shishkin meshes for numerous problems and numerical methods have been studied since and they are still very much in vogue. With this contribution we try to counter this development and lay the emphasis on more general meshes that - apart from performing better than piecewise-uniform meshes - provide a much deeper insight in the course of their analysis...",gnd:4333769-7 gnd:4479539-7 gnd:4128420-3

Learning to solve manipulation tasks from non-expert users in human-centered environments,"Abstract: A key goal of robotics research is to develop intelligent service robots that are capable of undertaking a variety of tasks in our everyday environments. To realize this, robots should be equipped with the capabilities to reason about and manipulate a rich spectrum of everyday objects to achieve desirable spatial relations using them, for example to organize objects on shelves or set a table for dinner.<br><br>However, to operate intelligently in domestic environments, robots should overcome several challenges. For example, there usually are several valid ways of attending to everyday chores depending on the environment and the preferences of the end-users. Moreover, robots will constantly encounter novel objects while attending to arbitrary tasks. Such factors render it infeasible for an expert to pre-program a robot with sufficient knowledge to handle all situations. Instead, robots should be able to continuously learn from their users and attend to tasks without having to constantly query them.<br><br>In this thesis, we present several contributions that address these challenges and enable robots to acquire manipulation skills to achieve desirable object configurations by interacting with their users and environments. Firstly, we present a novel approach based on recommender system theory that allows a robot to predict user preferences by extracting patterns of organizing objects across several users. This enables the robot to tailor its behavior to a specific user when solving a task such as organizing objects in containers. Secondly, we propose novel techniques to infer the multi-modal spatial constraints necessary to model and generalize a new manipulation action using a small number of demonstrations. We build on these techniques and propose a novel approach<br>to learning sequential manipulation tasks from non-expert users. Our contribution goes beyond existing paradigms by allowing the robot to sequence actions and improvise feasible task solutions without requiring the user to provide an explicit goal state for planning. Finally, we tackle the problem of lifelong learning of spatial relations and generalizing them to objects of various shapes and sizes. For this, we propose a novel approach based on distance metric learning to allow a robot to leverage its previous knowledge of relations to efficiently learn and generalize new ones.<br><br>We extensively evaluate our proposed approaches using real-world data acquired from different user ...",gnd:4033447-8 gnd:4396128-9

Small ball estimates for the fractional Brownian sheet,"We consider the d-dimensional fractional Brownian sheet, which is the centered Gaussian process $(B_x)_{x\in [0,1]d̂$ over the d-dimensional unit cube with covariance \[ {\bf E} B_x B_y =\prod_{j=1}d̂ (|x_j|\̂gamma + |y_j|\̂gamma - |x_j-y_j|\̂gamm)/2 \] where the parameter $\gamma$ takes values in the interval $(0,2)$.

For H\""older-type and Orlicz norms we obtain upper bounds and we cite known lower bounds both of polynomial order. The gap that still remains is of logarithmic order and does not depend on the dimension d. This improves known results.

Anthropogenic actions shape biodiversity change and ecosystem functioning,"Increasing rates of carbon emission, unsustainable development, and intense land cover change, led to an inevitable environmental degradation. While much of the lost biodiversity has not been described by scientists yet, we continue to lose new species at impressive rates. In this thesis, I compiled a large dataset for vertebrate assemblages in the Amazon forest, known for its extensive understudied biodiversity. The database englobes camera trap data from mammals, birds and reptile species and represents a small but important step further in the direction of filling the gap in biodiversity information for the Amazon forest. Using this dataset, I investigated the effects of human modifications on vertebrate communities in the Amazon, and the results show that, even within the gradient of low to moderate human modification, we can detect a decrease in the richness of vertebrate species. This raises a red flag for the vulnerability of species under our current scenario of changes in climate and land use. The functioning of the ecosystems involves complex processes and interactions of different species, and understanding the relationship between biodiversity change and the contribution of biodiversity to the provision of nature’s contribution to people (NCP) remains a challenge. In this thesis, I propose a macroecological framework that integrates biodiversity models and energy flux theory to link biodiversity, ecosystem function and NCP. This novel approach allows the incorporation of different aspects (such as species interactions and environmental data) to evaluate biodiversity-based NCP. Furthermore, in order to apply this framework to belowground ecosystems, I aggregated data and developed a biodiversity model to predict species abundance based on their body mass. Additionally, I also used the compiled database to explore the effects of environmental conditions on the community-abundance distribution of the communities.",gnd:4601495-0 gnd:7583382-7 gnd:4064354-2
Das Virushüllprotein VP2 des Polyomavirus : Struktur und Funktion,"['The murine polyomavirus encodes three structural proteins, VP1, VP2 and VP3, which together form the viral capsid. The capsids outer shell is composed of the major capsid protein VP1, the inner shell consists of VP2 and VP3. In order to get a detailed insight into the structure and function of VP2 and VP3 they were produced recombinant in Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies. The success of refolding was dependent on the presence of detergent in the refolding buffer. VP2 and VP3 are monomeric and their structures exhibit a high alpha-helical content. The function of both proteins was monitored by complex formation with VP1, as well as by in vitro hemolytic activity of VP2 and VP3, which fits well into a postulated membrane interaction during viral infection. In addition, the VP1-VP2 complex retained its capability to assemble into virus like particles, unlocking studies to investigate the assembly process further.', 'Das murine Polyomavirus kodiert drei Strukturproteine - VP1, VP2 und VP3 - welche zusammen die Virushülle bilden.

Damage tolerance behaviour of integral aircraft structures obtained by stationary shoulder friction stir welding,"['Research focusing on new ways to achieve weight reduction without sacrificing the safety performances of an aircraft is the subject of a constant push in the aeronautical industry. The use of riveting to join skin and stringer is highly optimised but in order to reduce structural weight, aside from the continuous development of new materials, it is important to use the already available materials in an efficient way. For this reason, friction stir welding (FSW) was looked at for many years as a suitable replacement alternative for riveting but the focus of the research was mostly driven with a material science point of view. Therefore, the development of a new solid-state welding technology ensuring good material properties and, at the same time, being investigated as a structural joint is still a necessity. The present-study addresses the development of a new procedure for joining skin and stringers made of dissimilar aluminium alloys by stationary shoulder friction stir welding (SSFSW), which is to be applied in primary aircraft structures. Three different joint configurations were developed, and their performances were compared. At first, a fundamental analysis of the correlation between the two main process parameters, welding speed and rotational speed on heat development and joint formation, was conducted. The correlation between the generated microstructure and the mechanical properties of the three configurations was investigated on coupon-size specimens. In the following step, the fatigue behaviour in sub-component scale was studied in terms of fatigue life and crack initiation for two of the joint configurations. In the last phase of the work, 5-stringer panels were realised by SSFSW using the joint configuration, which showed the best properties in the performed analysis. These panels were investigated in the context of a damage-tolerant environment to understand fatigue crack growth and residual strength behaviour in comparison to conventional joining technologies. At the coupon level, the three joint configurations showed higher mechanical performances for different loading conditions with respect to a conventionally riveted skin and stringer. The interface between the skin and the stringer’s alloys proved to play the largest influence on the strength of the joints. The two welding parameters control the geometry of this by influencing the material flow and heat generation. The notch-skin double pass (NS-DP) configuration proved to have limitations in terms of process development and were excluded from the study for up-scaled components. The sub-components realised by SSFSW with the two remaining joint variants showed higher fatigue performances in hoop-directions with respect to riveted structures. The SSFSW technology leads to half the stress concentration of a riveted T-joint and an increase of 50% in the fatigue limit. In spite of a similar fatigue life, in the NS-SP joints, crack turning and unwanted delamination of the stringer was observed. In the longitudinal load direction, a higher fatigue life was recorded for the 3-Part joints in the high-cycle area with respect to the NS-SP variant. From the fatigue crack growth (FCG) tests of the 5-stringer panels, the optimum load redistribution between skin and stringers joined by the SSFSW led to a reduction of the FCG rate for short cracks away from the stringers. This structural behaviour improves the FCG with respect to riveted and adhesive bonded structures. An increase in lifespan over 62% for a crack length that reaches the two-bay width has been shown. The residual strength of the SSFSW panels was measured for a two-bay crack showing a significant improvement over conventional joining techniques and confirming the superior quality of structures realised by SSFSW in a damage-tolerant environment.', 'Die Forschung, die sich auf neue Wege konzentriert, um eine Gewichtsreduzierung zu erreichen, ohne die Sicherheitsleistung eines Flugzeugs zu beeinträchtigen, ist in der Luftfahrtindustrie ein ständiges Thema. Die Verwendung von Nieten zum Verbinden von Haut und Stringer ist in hohem Maße optimiert. Um jedoch das strukturelle Gewicht zu verringern, ist es wichtig, neben der kontinuierlichen Entwicklung neuer Materialien die bereits verfügbaren Materialien auf effiziente Weise zu verwenden. Aus diesem Grund wurde das Reibrührschweißen (FSW) seit vielen Jahren als geeignete Ersatzalternative für das Nieten angesehen, der Schwerpunkt der Forschung lag jedoch hauptsächlich auf materialwissenschaftlichen Gesichtspunkten. Daher ist die Entwicklung einer neuen Festkörperschweißtechnologie, die gute Materialeigenschaften gewährleistet und gleichzeitig als strukturelle Verbindung untersucht wird, weiterhin eine Notwendigkeit. Die vorliegende Studie befasst sich mit der Entwicklung eines neuen Verfahrens zum Verbinden von Haut und Stringern aus unterschiedlichen Aluminiumlegierungen durch stationäres Schulterreibungsrührschweißen (SSFSW), das in primären Flugzeugstrukturen angewendet werden soll. Drei verschiedene Verbindungskonfigurationen wurden entwickelt und ihre Leistungsfähigkeit verglichen. Zunächst wurde eine grundlegende Analyse der Korrelation zwischen den beiden Hauptprozessparametern Schweißgeschwindigkeit und Drehzahl bei Wärmeentwicklung und Ausbildung der Schweßnaht durchgeführt. Die Korrelation zwischen der erzeugten Mikrostruktur und den mechanischen Eigenschaften der drei Konfigurationen wurde an Probekörpern mit Coupongröße untersucht. Im folgenden Schritt wurde das Ermüdungsverhalten im Teilkomponentenmaßstab in Bezug auf die Ermüdungslebensdauer und die Rissentstehung für zwei der Verbindungskonfigurationen untersucht. In der letzten Phase der Arbeit wurden von SSFSW 5-Stringer-Paneele unter Verwendung der Fugenkonfiguration realisiert, die die besten Eigenschaften in der durchgeführten Analyse zeigten. Diese Platten wurden hinsichtlich der Schadenstoleranzeigenschaften untersucht, um das Ermüdungsrisswachstum und das Verhalten der Restfestigkeit im Vergleich zu herkömmlichen Verbindungstechnologien zu verstehen. Auf Couponebene zeigten die drei Verbindungskonfigurationen höhere mechanische Belastbarkeit für unterschiedliche Belastungsbedingungen in Bezug auf eine herkömmlich genietete Haut/Stringer-Verbindungen. Es zeigte sich, dass die Grenzfläche zwischen der Haut und den Stringerlegierungen den größten Einfluss auf die Festigkeit der Gelenke hat. Die beiden Schweißparameter steuern deren Geometrie durch Beeinflussung des Materialflusses und der Wärmeerzeugung. Die Notch-Skin-Double-Pass-Konfiguration (NS-DP) zeigte Einschränkungen hinsichtlich der Prozessentwicklung und wurde für hochskalierte Komponenten aus der Studie ausgeschlossen. Die von SSFSW mit den beiden verbleibenden Gelenkvarianten realisierten Unterkomponenten zeigten höhere Ermüdungsleistungen in Hoop-Richtungen in Bezug auf genietete Strukturen. Die SSFSW-Technologie führt zu einer Halbierung der Spannungskonzentration eines genieteten T-Stücks und einer Erhöhung der Ermüdungsgrenze um 50%. Trotz einer ähnlichen Ermüdungslebensdauer wurde in den NS-SP-Verbindungen eine Rissbildung und eine unerwünschte Delamination des Stringers beobachtet. In Längsrichtung der Belastung wurde für die 3-teiligen Verbindungen im Hochzyklusbereich eine höhere Lebensdauer gegenüber der NS-SP-Variante verzeichnet. Aus den Ermüdungsrisswachstumstests (FCG-Tests) der 5-Stringer-Paneele ergab sich, dass die optimale Lastumverteilung zwischen Haut und Stringern, die durch das SSFSW verbunden wurden, zu einer Verringerung der FCG-Rate für kurze Risse von den Stringern weg führte. Dieses strukturelle Verhalten verbessert das Ermüdungsrisswachstum in Bezug auf genietete und geklebte Strukturen. Bei einer Risslänge, die die Breite von zwei Feldern erreicht, wurde eine Verlängerung der Lebensdauer um mehr als 62% festgestellt. Die Restfestigkeit der SSFSW-Platten wurde für einen Zwei-Feld-Riss gemessen, der eine signifikante Verbesserung gegenüber herkömmlichen Verbindungstechniken zeigte und die überlegene Qualität der von SSFSW in einer schaden toleranten Systemmumgebung bestätigte.']",gnd:7554620-6

Interpretation of temperature signals from ice cores : insights into the spatial and temporal variability of water isotopes in Antarctica,"Earth's climate varies continuously across space and time, but humankind has witnessed only a small snapshot of its entire history, and instrumentally documented it for a mere 200 years. Our knowledge of past climate changes is therefore almost exclusively based on indirect proxy data, i.e. on indicators which are sensitive to changes in climatic variables and stored in environmental archives. Extracting the data from these archives allows retrieval of the information from earlier times. Obtaining accurate proxy information is a key means to test model predictions of the past climate, and only after such validation can the models be used to reliably forecast future changes in our warming world. The polar ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica are one major climate archive, which record information about local air temperatures by means of the isotopic composition of the water molecules embedded in the ice. However, this temperature proxy is, as any indirect climate data, not a perfect recorder of past climatic variations.

Applications of the Ugi reaction in the synthesis of cyclic and N-Alkylated peptides,"['This thesis describes a novel strategy for the solution- and solid-phase macrocyclization of peptides assisted by traceless turn inducers for increasing the macrocyclization efficacy. The approach uses Ugi-4 component ligation of a peptide carboxylic acid and an isocyanopeptide using a cleavable amine, thus leading to a peptide including an N-alkylated amino acid equidistant along the sequence. The incorporated removable N-alkyl substituent serves as a turn-inducing moiety and facilitates the macrocyclic ring closure. The facilitation of the macrocyclization by the turn inducing assistance was proved with a variety of tetra- and heptapeptides. Also, a study of the conformational s-cis / s-trans equilibrium around the peptide bond close to the N-alkylated position in two peptidic models was performed.

Nanoscale characterization of biopolymers using atomic force microscopy and plasmon-enhanced raman spectroscopy,"Proteins are large, complex macromolecules found in every cell and cell component and play a variety of roles essential to the body's functioning. There are four levels of protein structures, which can be classified as follows: primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary. Understanding the structure of proteins is often necessary to understand their biological processes. Several analytical techniques are commonly used to characterize the different structures of proteins. For example, X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and electron microscopy (EM) are established techniques. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is another imaging technique that can be used to characterize the nanoscale surface properties of materials. AFM's ability to produce images up to atomic-level resolution is one of its most significant advantages. It can also be used to examine a wide variety of materials, such as metals, semiconductors, polymers, and biological samples, and it can be used in a variety of environments, including air, liquid, and vacuum. Raman spectroscopy is a powerful analytical technique that identifies and studies the vibrational modes of molecules. Nonetheless, this Raman effect is a rare event, and proteins in the cell are present at extremely low concentrations, which contributes to the weak Raman signal. In order to improve the sensitivity and resolution of the method, scientists employ a technique based on the surface plasmon resonance effect, which increases the local electric field of the incident light and, consequently, the Raman signal (plasmon-enhanced Raman spectroscopy). When combined with the AFM technique, both high-resolution images and detailed chemical information can be retrieved, making this technique a highly effective method for characterizing protein structures. In this thesis, three levels of protein structures were characterized using AFM and plasmon-enhanced Raman spectroscopy.",gnd:4176916-8

From the extract of a Khuskia oryzae strain two oxylipins were identified, one of them was found to be new. A plant immune assay was carried out on all endophytic fungal extracts to test for the presence of elicitors of immune response of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. To examine the interaction between the endophytes, the strain extracts exerting antifungal activity were tested for their effects on the growth of the other endophytic strains in agar diffusion assays. Results of this study suggest that the endophytes of B. pilosa contribute to the known dominance of this plant through their bioactive metabolites. The one meter height observed for the plant is most probably stimulated by the production of the auxin indole carboxylic acid by all its endophytic strains. The antifungal activity of some secondary metabolites against phytopathogens suggests a plant protective effect exerted by the endophytes.",gnd:4165300-2 gnd:4300564-0 gnd:4291566-1 gnd:4152183-3 gnd:7688861-7 gnd:4312746-0

Astrometric search for extrasolar planets in stellar multiple systems,"Taking our own solar system as an archetype, most exoplanet search programs are concentrated on single and solar like stars. However, it is an accepted estimation that about the half of all stars are a member of a stellar multiple systems, but the multiplicity rate of the currently known exoplanet host stars is just about 17%. Furthermore, differences are found comparing the properties of planets around single stars and in stellar multiple systems. The mass as well as the number of planets in such stellar multiple systems depends on the separation of its host star to the nearest stellar companion. For the closest stellar systems known today harboring at least one exoplanet that separation is about 20 AU, which indicates an existing lower limit in the binary separation for stable planet formation. Astrometric imaging, assisted by an adaptive optics system, achieves an angular resolution down to 0.1 as, which is ideal to search for planets in such close binary stars where planet formation is affected by a close stellar companion. Regarding disturbing effects like e.g. atmospheric refraction and stellar aberration, an astrometric search program was developed and tested on the binary star HD19994. While trying to detect the astrometric signal of a RV planet candidate around the primary, a new low-mass star (0.335 solar masses) around the secondary was found by the astrometric observations (confirmed by speckle interferometry as well as follow-up RV observations). Looking at the astrometric residuals any further astrometric signal larger than 1 mas can be excluded, which results in an upper mass of about 12 Jupiter masses for HD 19994 Ab, thus it is a planet. The final multi-epoch precision achieved in this work is about 0.1 mas, which is one of the highest astrometric precisions reached by ground based observations. That precision enables to detect Jovian planets around nearby solar like stars and even less mass planets around nearby low-mass stars.",gnd:4456110-6 gnd:4285929-3
Terahertz metamaterials : from fundamental coupling mechanisms to new terahertz metasurfaces and functional emitters,"Zusammenfassung: The central topic of this thesis is the investigation of a new kind of optical materials, so called metamaterials. These artificially created materials consist of periodically arranged sub-wavelength sized resonant structures. Their optical properties can be designed by changing the form, size or arrangement of the sub-structures. The resonator's interaction among each other and with an incident light-field is investigated experimentally in the terahertz regime of the electromagnetic spectrum. In the first part of this thesis the fundamental electromagnetic interaction between one type of sub-structure, a single Split-Ring resonator, is investigated in two dimensional arrays.Then the complexity of interaction was increased by adding a second Split-Ring inside each unit cell, which results in the formation of a particular kind of resonance, a so called Fano resonance. The line-shape of this sharp asymmetrically shaped resonance was then controlled by the separation between the two resonators.In the third part a new type of optical materials is presented, a wave vector selective surface. This ultra thin structured surface can filter out waves, which arrive under oblique incident on the surface, operating effectively as a tunnel vision filter. In the last part a novel method is presented to excite resonant structures on semiconductor substrates using visible light. As one example this technique is than used as an inverse near-field microscope, to map the electromagnetic near-fields of those resonators with sub-wavelength resolution",gnd:4346673-4 gnd:7547278-8

Until now, mincers are not suited for producing fine comminuted emulsified meat batters at high quality, therefore choppers are used. The aim of this work was to develop a continuous process for the production of fine comminuted emulsified meat battersfor high-quality cooked sausages, based on the mincing principle. At first, the operation principles of mincing (fixed knife cut, rotating shear cut) were described and the necessary works (compression, friction, disintegration, shift) were derivedby using mathematical models. Next, the influences on works or length of meat pieces by raw material (e.g. type of tissue, temperature, sample size) and technology (drill-hole diameter, pressure) were deduced. Based on this, the new process for production of fine comminuted emulsified meat batter were developed (and patented).

Effects of above- and belowground biodiversity on the metabolome of common grassland species in different environmental contexts,"The loss of biodiversity is negatively affecting ecosystem functions and biotic interactions. However, it is those biotic interactions that are essential for ecosystem fitness, productivity, and resilience. In terrestrial ecosystems, the multitrophic above-belowground interactions among plants, their soil biota, and the aboveground herbivore community drive many important ecosystem processes. While we know of the close connections between plants and their soil biota community or plants and their herbivore community, we still lack the mechanistic understanding underlying these biotic interactions. It is here that the newly emerging research area of ecological metabolomics (eco-metabolomics) may provide new insights by uncovering the molecular processes of plant-soil-herbivore interactions. My dissertation aimed to provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying plant-soil-herbivore interaction by combining the application of eco-metabolomics with biodiversity experiments. I combined controlled pot experiments with a field experiment in a semi-natural grassland to test whether different levels of plant diversity and soil biota diversity affect plant metabolomes. Furthermore, I tested if these changes in plant metabolomes and the diversity of secondary metabolites can be linked to aboveground herbivory to explain variation therein. My dissertation provides experimental evidence that plant diversity can induce shifts in soil biota diversity that can affect the plant’s metabolome as well as the concentration and diversity of secondary metabolites. In addition, my results suggest that the plant’s metabolome is a novel and important functional trait that can link plant diversity and herbivory, and explain variation thereof. By including metabolomic analyses, we gained a better understanding for the importance of plant-soil interactions in shaping ecosystem processes, such as aboveground plant-herbivore interactions, via their effect on the plant’s metabolome.",gnd:4601495-0 gnd:4043216-6 gnd:1138059420

Data driven approaches to infer the regulatory mechanism shaping and constraining levels of metabolites in metabolic networks,"Systems biology aims at investigating biological systems in its entirety by gathering and analyzing large-scale data sets about the underlying components. Computational systems biology approaches use these large-scale data sets to create models at different scales and cellular levels. In addition, it is concerned with generating and testing hypotheses about biological processes. However, such approaches are inevitably leading to computational challenges due to the high dimensionality of the data and the differences in the dimension of data from different cellular layers.

The role of occipital temporal cortex in the formation of face familiarity and identity,"The recognition of faces holds a special role in human cognition, which reflects in multiple involved regions in the occipito-temporal cortex (OTC). One region is the Occipital Face Area (OFA), previously described as a low-level, structural encoding area. This work investigates whether the OFA plays a more complex role in face processing with a focus on the familiarity status of a face and their identity representation. For this purpose, four studies were implemented to answer if the OFA is participating in low- as well as high-level face representations and what the temporal dynamics of electrophysiological responses to familiarity and identity learning are. Further, we evaluated if the different processing of familiar and unfamiliar faces can be detected and are modulated by the OFA. In Study I we demonstrated, that Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) over the rOFA impairs encoding of trained face images. This indicates that this region is involved in the encoding of image-specific face representations. Study II lead to the conclusion, that TMS of the OFA reduces accuracy in retrieving face-associated job titles. This suggests that this region is not limited to visual information. Study III revealed, that the quality of familiarization impacts neural representations as they were visible after personal-, weaker after media-, and absent after perceptual-familiarization. Study IV connected neural signals of familiarity with TMS of the OFA and showed that this region indeed is causally involved in the differential processing of familiar and unfamiliar faces. Our findings indicate, that the OTC processes perceptual face information, identity representations and associating semantic information. Hence, the OFA is not limited to low-level feature processing, but is versatile involved in the face network. This suggests a re-evaluation of hierarchical face models and favors a non-hierarchical model with connections between the OFA and higher face processing areas.",gnd:4020687-7 gnd:4031630-0 gnd:4026482-8 gnd:4078921-4 gnd:4188097-3 gnd:1142448436

Migration and Making an Income in the Context of ‘Human Trafficking’ : Imponderable Experiences and Sense-Making at a South African Border,"The book focuses on volatile processes at the South African-Zimbabwean border that arise from practices of migration and income generating activities. The processes are influenced by neoliberal developments and controversial discourses on migration, commercial sexual services, and human trafficking. In this unstable environment, different actors continuously negotiate, trying to achieve stable positions. By addressing issues related to migration and income generating activities, they maneuver between legal rules and their own moral values and interests. In their attempt to classify incidents in the border context that are unclear to them, actors’ explanations are partly based on the concept of transnational human trafficking. Thereby, they transfer the impenetrability discursively associated with this concept to what they see as obscure cross-border migration, disconcerting sexual services, and other alienating economic activities. Alternatively, actors understand undocumented cross-border migration, commercial sexual services, and other illegalised income-generating activities as common everyday practices at the border and also assume that human trafficking does not play an important role there.

Localization of Bose-Einstein condensates in one-dimensional random potentials,"Abstract: Within the present thesis, we investigate, analytically and numerically, the expansion of initially strongly confined wave packets in one-dimensional, correlated random potentials.In the first part, we focus on single-particle wave packets, i. e. without considering interactions between particles. At long times, the expansion of the wave packet comes to a halt due to destructive interferences leading to Anderson localization. The resulting stationary density profile has been measured in experiments on Bose-Einstein condensates in one-dimensional random potentials, but existing theories are unable to explain the behaviour of the density profile at the center. To improve this situation, we develop an analytical description for the disorder averaged localized density profile. For this purpose, we employ the diagrammatic method of Berezinskii, which we generalize to the case of wave packets, present an analytical expression of the localization length which is valid for small as well as for high energies and finally, develop a self-consistent Born approximation in order to analytically calculate the energy distribution of our wave packet. By comparison with numerical simulations, we show that our theory describes well the complete localized density profile, not only in the tails but also in the center.In the second part, we discuss the influence of interactions on the spatial expansion of Bose-Einstein condesates in one-dimensional random potentials. We show, by comparison with numerical data, that the quasi stationary state reached at intermediate times can be well described within the theory developed for the non-interacting case, provided that the interactions are taken into account through the choice of an effective initial state",gnd:4402897-0

"Ultra-hoch gefüllte und orientierte CNT- und 3D-vernetzte Aerographit Epoxidkomposite : Synthese, Herstellung und Eigenschaften","[""In this work two different polymer nanocomposites (PNCs) with graphitic fillers in epoxy matrix are characterized. Both PNCs possess structural features, which are used to address open scientific questions in the field of carbon nanotube (CNT) based PNCs. The PNCs of this work use in-house synthesized nanoparticles, which are: mm-long, unidirectional aligned carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and covalently 3D interconnected graphite-based networks ('Aerographite', AG). For CNT-based PNCs (CNT-PNCs) a manufacturing method is introduced (patented), which allows to embed very high amounts of CNTs in epoxy matrix (Φ= 10-70 wt.%). Two different structures are given for these CNT-based PNCs: APNCs: PNCs with unidirectional alignment of mm-long, in-house produced CNTs (anisotropic). RPNCs: PNCs with randomly oriented CNTs (mm-long in-house produced CNTs or µm-long commercial CNT) (isotropic). AG-PNCs: Aerographite-based PNCs are PNCs with an isotropic, covalently interconnected graphite filler network embedded in epoxy matrix (Φ<1\u2009wt.%) (isotropic). Here different orientations, different aspect ratios and different qualities of CNTs are directly compared. The scaling of electrical conductivity and Young's moduli in respect to filler loadings are in focus of the investigations (σ (Φ) , E(Φ)). The piezoresistive and thermoelectric behavior of CNT-based PNCs with filler loadings Φ >5\u2009wt.% are investigated here for the first time. The findings for CNT-PNCs are combined with the results on AG-PNCs. The influence of inner network topologies on electrical conduction is discussed in detail. If the graphitic networks of AGs are infiltrated with epoxy, AG-PNCs of low filler loading and isotropic structure result. Inner graphite elements of AGs are covalently interconnected. Therefore AG-PNCs can be used to investigate the influence of reduced electron tunneling on the electrical conduction and piezoresistive behavior of PNCs. It can be shown, that highly filled APNCs can lead to highly improved material properties like electrical conductivities up to σ= 37000\u2009S/m and Youngs's moduli up to E= 36\u2009GPa. On the other hand APNCs are shown to follow similar scaling rules of electrical conduction (σ(Φ)), as they had been derived from dispersed CNT-PNCs in the last two decades of research. The inner interconnections of AG lead to -\u2009compared to all of today's CNT-based PNCs\u2009- effective electrical conduction (σ/Φ). Appendix: Aerographite (AG): In the year 2010 first time a metal oxide (ZnO) was shown to be a feasible substrate for graphite deposition via a chemical vapor deposition process (CVD). Technically no other synthesis offers following combination: (i) structuring by tailored ceramic networks & graphite deposition with in situ removal of template. The density and inner structure of AG can be altered by the CVD-process. Scientifically the details of nucleation and growth of graphite within the CVD-process is not yet fully understood.

Es werden zwei graphitische Füllstoffe in Epoxidmatrix untersucht: Kohlenstoffnanotubes (CNTs) und “Aerographit” (AG). Die PNCs dieser Arbeit unterscheiden sich hinsichtlich Füllstoffgehalt und Morphologie wie folgt: CNT-basierte PNCs (CNT-PNCs): PNCs mit unidirektionaler Ausrichtung (APNCs, anisotrop) und willkürlicher Ausrichtung (RPNCs, isotrop) von CNTs. Es wird der Bereich von Φ= 10-68\u2009wt.% Gewichtsanteil untersucht. AG-basierter PNCs (AG-PNCs): PNCs mit 3D-vernetzten Graphitnetzwerken in Epoxidmatrix. Die inneren Elemente sind isotrop orientiert und kovalent vernetzt. Es wird der Bereich Φ= 0,2-0,6\u2009wt.% Gewichtsanteil untersucht. Die Skalierung der elektrischen Leitfähigkeit und die Skalierung der E-Moduln werden bei bisher nicht vorhandener Variationsbreite der CNT-Gewichtsanteilen untersucht (σ (Φ) , E(Φ)). Eine zentrale Fragestellung ist, wie sich eine strenge Anisotropie (CNT-PNCs) oder eine kovalente Vernetzung (AG-PNCs) auf die Effizienz der elektr. Leitung pro Füllstoffanteil (σ/Φ) auswirkt. Speziellere Fragen sind u.a.: Wie wird die Piezoresistivität von CNT-PNCs beeinflusst, wenn die Abstände zwischen CNTs so weit reduziert werden, dass sie im Bereich ihrer Abmessungen liegen? Dominiert eher die Orientierung der CNTs oder der Füllstoffanteil der CNTs das piezoresistive und thermoelektrische Verhalten von CNT-PNCs? Lassen sich maximale Grenzen für E-Moduln und elektr. Leitfähigkeiten von CNT-PNCs ableiten? Methodisch ist wird die Untersuchung durch ein neues Herstellungsverfahren für APNCs/RPNCs möglich (Patent). Hierbei können sehr verschiedene Arten von CNTs verarbeitet werden. Struktur-Eigenschafts-Beziehungen werden anhand von gerichteten in-house MWCNTs (l> 1,3\u2009mm), ungerichteten in-house MWCNTs (l> 1,3\u2009mm) und ungerichteten kommerziellen MWCNTs ( l=0,01\u2009mm) betrachtet. Die APNCs u. RPNCs dieser Arbeit werden mit dem bisherigen Wissen über dispergierte CNT-PNCs verglichen. Dispergierten CNT-PNCs weisen i.d.R. nur keine Orientierung der CNTs und nur niedrige Füllstoffanteile auf. Mit den APNCs können weit gesteigerte Materialkennwerte erreicht werden (APNCs: σ= 37000\u2009S/m, E= 36\u2009GPa; RPNCs: σ= 3000\u2009S/m, E= 6\u2009GPa). Es kann hier gezeigt werden, dass die elektrische Leitfähigkeit von hoch gefüllten APNCs ähnlichen Skalierungsregeln σ (Φ) folgt, wie sie für dispergierte CNT-PNCs abgeleitet sind. Die isotropen und kovalent vernetzten Graphitnetzwerke des Aerographits können vollständig mit Epoxiden gefüllt werden. Die resultierenden AG-PNCs sind hinsichtlich Füllstoffanteile und Isotropie mit typischen dispergierten CNT-PNCs vergleichbar. Es wird die Auswirkung einer reduzierten Tunnelleitung das piezoresistive Verhalten und die elektr. Leitfähigkeit von PNCs mit graphitischen Füllstoffen untersucht. Eine gegenüber allen bisherigen CNT-PNCs (dispergierte CNT-PNCs u. hoch gefüllte APNCs/RPNCs) erhöhte Effizienz der elektr. Leitung pro Füllstoffanteil (σ / Φ) kann gezeigt werden.

Liberation of low molecular weight organic acids from sedimentary organic matter and their role on microbial activity,"Low molecular weight organic acids (LMWOAs) are important nutrients for microbes. However, most LMWOAs do not exist freely in the environment but are bound to macromolecular organic matter, e.g. kerogen, lignite and coal. During burial and geological maturation of sedimentary macromolecular organic matter biological and abiological processes promote the liberation of LMWOAs into the surrounding sediment. Through this process, microbes in sedimentary subsurface environments are supplied with essential nutrients. To estimate the feedstock potential of buried macromolecular organic matter to many environments it is important to determine the amount of LMWOAs that are bound to such a matrix. However, high-pressure and high temperature are a key feature of deep subsurface environments, and these physical parameters have a profound influence on chemical reaction kinetics. Therefore it is essential for the estimation of the feedstock potential to generate high-pressure and high temperature for the liberation of LMWOAs to recreate true in-situ conditions. This work presents a newly developed, inexpensive incubation system for biological and geological samples. It allows the application of high-pressure and high temperature as well as a subsampling of the liquid phase without loss of pressure, thereby not disturbing the on-going processes. When simulating the liberation of LMWOAs from sedimentary organic matter, the newly developed incubation system produces more realistic results than other extraction systems like Soxhlet. The extraction products remain in the extraction medium throughout the extraction, influencing the chemical conditions of the extraction medium. Sub-bituminous coal samples from New Zealand as well as lignite samples from Germany were extracted at elevated temperature (90˚C) and pressure (5 MPa). The main LMWOAs released from these low rank coals were formate, acetate and oxalate. Extraction efficiency was increased by two to four times for formate, acetate and oxalate in comparison to existing extraction methods without pressurisation and with demineralised water. This shows the importance of pressure for the simulation of true in-situ conditions and suggests that the amount of bioavailable LMWOAs is higher than previously thought. With the increase in carbon capture and storage (CCS) and the enhanced recovery of oil and gas (EOR/EGR), more and more CO2 becomes injected into the underground. However, the effects of elevated concentrations of carbon dioxide on sedimentary organic matter are rarely investigated. As the incuabtion system allows the manipulation of the composition and partial pressure of dissolved gasses, the effect of highly gas-enriched (CO2, CO2/SO2, CO2/NO2; to simulate flue gas conditions) waters on the extraction yield of LMWOAs from macromolecular organic matter was evaluated. For sub-bituminous coal the concentrations of all LMWAOs decreased upon the addition of gas, irrespective of its composition, whereas for lignite formate always and acetate mostly increased, while oxalate decreased. This suggests an positive effect on the nutrient supply for the subsurface microbiota of lignite layers, as formate and acetate are the most common LMWOAs used for microbial metabolism. In terrestrial mud volcanoes (TMVs), sedimentary material is rapidly ascending from great depth to the surface. Therefore LMWOAs that were produced from buried macromolecular organic matter at depth are also brought up to the surface, and fuel heterotrophic microbial ecosystems at the surface. TMVs represent geochemically and microbiologically diverse habitats, which are supplied with organic substrates and electron acceptors from deep-seated hydrocarbon-generating systems and intersected shallow aquifers, respectively. The main electron donor in TMVs in Azerbaijan is sulphate, and microbial sulphate reduction leads to the production of a wide range of reduced sulphur species that are key players in several biological processes. In our study we estimated the effect of LMWOAs on the sulphur metabolising activity of microorganims in TMVs from Azerbaijan. The addition of a mixture of volatile fatty acids containing acetate and other LMWOAs showed significant positive response to the sulphate reduction rate (SRR) of samples of several mud volcanoes. Further investigations on the temperature dependency of the SRR and the characterisation of thermophilic sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) showed a connection between the deep hot subsurface and the surface",gnd:4659394-9

Molecular characterization of a fungal aldehyde dehydrogenase in the Tricholoma vaccinumspruce ectomycorrhiza,"Understanding of ectomycorrhiza functioning has been slowed down by less investigations of this symbiotic association at the molecular level. In this study, the possible role of a specific fungal aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) in the host-specific mutual symbiosis between the basidiomycete fungus Tricholoma vaccinum and its compatible host plant spruce (Picea abies) was investigated. Also, the involvement of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) in ectomycorrhiza formation, which has been controversially observed and discussed in literature, was investigated in detail. As a first step, the ectomycorrhiza-specifically expressed gene ald1 was isolated from T. vaccinum. Sequence analysis showed that the ORF of ald1 is interrupted by 16 introns. The conceptually translated protein, Ald1, of 502 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 53 kDa was subsequently confirmed by Western blotting. An alignment of Ald1 with other 53 specific fungal ALDHs, representing all major phyla in the kingdom of fungi, was used to reinvestigate the evolutionary relationships in this enzyme family. The phylogenetic reconstruction, under Bayesian inference, revealed that, with the exception of chytridiomycota, fungal ALDHs, which clustered in distinct taxonomic groups in the phylogram, underwent two major duplication events during evolution resulting in multiple ALDH paralogs, with specifically high number of paralogs in higher fungi. Stress Response Elements (STREs) were observed in the promoter region of ald1, suggesting a possible role of stress induction for this gene...",gnd:4017047-0 gnd:4151671-0 gnd:4256436-0 gnd:4381523-6 gnd:4324574-2
Non-langevin recombination in fullerene and non-fullerene acceptor solar cells,"Organic solar cells (OSCs), in recent years, have shown high efficiencies through the development of novel non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs). Fullerene derivatives have been the centerpiece of the accepting materials used throughout organic photovoltaic (OPV) research. However, since 2015 novel NFAs have been a game-changer and have overtaken fullerenes. However, the current understanding of the properties of NFAs for OPV is still relatively limited and critical mechanisms defining the performance of OPVs are still topics of debate. In this thesis, attention is paid to understanding reduced-Langevin recombination with respect to the device physics properties of fullerene and non-fullerene systems. The work is comprised of four closely linked studies. The first is a detailed exploration of the fill factor (FF) expressed in terms of transport and recombination properties in a comparison of fullerene and non-fullerene acceptors. We investigated the key reason behind the reduced FF in the NFA (ITIC-based) devices which is faster non-geminate recombination relative to the fullerene (PCBM[70]-based) devices.

Non-Standard Inferences in Description Logics,"Description logics (DLs) are used to represent structured knowledge. Inference services testing consistency of knowledge bases and computing subconcept/superconcept hierarchies are the main feature of DL systems. Intensive research during the last fifteen years has led to highly optimized systems that allow to reason about knowledge bases efficiently. However, applications often require additional non-standard inferences to support both the construction and the maintenance of knowledge bases, thus making the inference procedures again incomplete. This book, which is a revised version of the author's PhD thesis, constitutes a significant step to fill this gap by providing an excellent formal foundation of the most prominent non-standard inferences.

Hydrological and erosion responses to man-made and natural disturbances : insights from forested catchments in South-central Chile,"Logging and large earthquakes are disturbances that may significantly affect hydrological and erosional processes and process rates, although in decisively different ways. Despite numerous studies that have documented the impacts of both deforestation and earthquakes on water and sediment fluxes, a number of details regarding the timing and type of de- and reforestation; seismic impacts on subsurface water fluxes; or the overall geomorphic work involved have remained unresolved. The main objective of this thesis is to address these shortcomings and to better understand and compare the hydrological and erosional process responses to such natural and man-made disturbances. To this end, south-central Chile provides an excellent natural laboratory owing to its high seismicity and the ongoing conversion of land into highly productive plantation forests.

Neue Unternehmerische Migranten aus China in Jakutsk (Russland) : lokale gesellschaftliche Inkorporation in der Migration,"['Zusammenfassung: So-called new entrepreneurial migrants have been leaving the People’s Republic of China since the 1980s in search of markets for Chinese export goods, heading to remote places all over the world. In this context, the market place Stoličny in Yakutsk, in the eastern part of Siberian Russia, has become a transfer site for articles of medium-term demand. This research is on the traders’ and employees’ local social incorporation, a term which I use to denote their embededdness in social networks at the migration site.   The migrants’ interaction with the local society is exclusively of an economic nature, while social connections are virtually non-existent. At the same time, migrants are embedded in familial and ethnic relations with their compatriots. This mode of incorporation can be considered a result of the interaction of several factors: the individual sojourner’s conception of their migration, familial and ethnic social relations that exist during migration and migrants’ experiences from their interaction with different local groups of agents in the course of trading.   My research showed that existent theories on incorporation and ethnic entrepreneurship, which are mainly based on the “classic” South-North migration, need adjustment and refinement in in this specific context of migration. In particular, the need to include different types of migration (sojourner, transmigrant, immigrant etc.) and the respective individual conceptions in theories on social incorporation became apparent. Moreover, in the case of Chinese entrepreneurial migration, future research needs to pay more attention to a differentiation of the various degrees of significance of familial and ethnic networks', 'Zusammenfassung: Seit den 1980er Jahren verlassen „neue unternehmerische Migranten“ die Volksrepublik China und erschließen weltweit neue Märkte für chinesische Exportwaren.

Diese Arbeit widmet sich der Einbettung der chinesischen Händler und ihrer Angestellten in soziale Strukturen am Migrationsort – ein Prozess, der als lokale gesellschaftliche Inkorporation bezeichnet wird.   In Bezug auf die Lokalgesellschaft ist die Inkorporation durch ein selektiv ökonomisches Interagieren und eine nicht vorhandene soziale Anbindung gekennzeichnet. Gleichzeitig sind die Migranten in Jakutsk in familiäre sowie in informelle, situationsbedingte ethnische Beziehungen eingebettet. Diese Inkorporationsform ergibt sich aus dem Zusammenspiel verschiedener Faktoren: erstens dem Migrationsplan der chinesischen sojourner, zweitens den familiären und ethnischen Sozialstrukturen während der Migration und drittens den Erfahrungen der Migranten in der Interaktion mit verschiedenen lokalgesellschaftlichen Akteursgruppen.   Die Forschung hat gezeigt, dass Theorien zur Inkorporation und zum ethnischen Unternehmertum, welche weitgehend auf der „klassischen“ Süd-Nord-Migration basieren, in diesem spezifischen Migrationskontext angepasst und differenziert werden müssen. Insbesondere sollten verschiedene Migrationstypen (sojourner, Transmigranten, Immigranten etc.) und entsprechende individuelle Konzeptionen der Migration stärkere Beachtung in der Theoriebildung finden. Im Falle neuer unternehmerischer Migration aus China muss außerdem die Bedeutung familiärer und ethnischer Netzwerke differenzierter betrachtet werden']",gnd:4027238-2 gnd:4120730-0

Multifunctional patchy silica particles via microcontact printing,"This research addressed the question, if it is possible to simplify current microcontact printing systems for the production of anisotropic building blocks or patchy particles, by using common chemicals while still maintaining reproducibility, high precision and tunability of the Janus-balance. Chapter 2 introduced the microcontact printing materials as well as their defined electrostatic interactions. In particular polydimethylsiloxane stamps, silica particles and high molecular weight polyethylenimine ink were mainly used in this research. All of these components are commercially available in large quantities and affordable, which gives this approach a huge potential for further up-scaling developments. The benefits of polymeric over molecular inks was described including its flexible influence on the printing pressure. With this alteration of the µCP concept, a new method of solvent assisted particle release mechanism enabled the switch from two-dimensional surface modification to three-dimensional structure printing on colloidal silica particles, without changing printing parameters or starting materials.

Dispersion forces : analysis of local-field effects and inclusion of excitation,"In this thesis, we have used macroscopic quantum electrodynamics to extend the concept of dispersion forces to objects in media and on excited systems.Our results facilitate a deeper understanding of dispersion interactions in the context of biological systems and colloid science.They stress the potential of amplification and left-handed metamaterials for manipulating dispersion forces on atoms and bodies in nanotechnologies.We have first studied the asimir-Polder potential of ground-state atom in front of a planar interface between two magnetodielectric media where the local-field correction is implemented via the Onsager real-cavity model.In particular, we have proposed an estimate of the on-surface value of the potential.Secondly, we have examined the Casimir-Polder interaction of a ground-state atom and a small magnetodielectric sphere in the presence of arbitrary magnetodielectric background media and bodies. We have proposed a model that is able to describe molecular systems of arbitrary size.To demonstrate the impact of negative refraction on the Casimir-Polder potential and the spontaneous decay rate of an excited atom, we have studied a superlens scenario.We have shown that an arbitrarily small but finite amount of material absorption drastically changes the Casimir-Polder potential and the decay rate compared to the ideal scenario with vanishing absorption.We have further calculated the Casimir force on an amplifying but linearly responding, magnetoelectric body. As we have shown, amplification leads to resonant force components which can be exploited to create repulsive Casimir forces.

The workability of concrete over a period of more than 90 hours can be achieved by long-term retarders. This new type of admixture is based on phosphonic acid. By systematic investigations profound knowledge about the operative mechanisms of long-term retarders could be drawn. The retarding action is due to a formation of sparingly soluble calcium phosphonate which seal upœ the particle surface. Whether the addition of long-term retarder leads to an immediate formation of calcium phosphonate or to a short termed acceleration of the hydration of reactive clinker phases depends on the supply of solved calcium. Because of the adjusted calcium sulphate content in cement the concentration of calcium is high enough for an immediate formation of sparingly soluble calcium! phosphonate. In combination with the formation of primary ettringite the calcium sulphate agent is the basis for the desired mode of action of the long-term retarder.",gnd:4193125-7 gnd:4213109-1 gnd:4174415-9 gnd:4265695-3 gnd:4067577-4 gnd:4175393-8 gnd:4120653-8
Distribution patterns and environmental drivers of methane-cycling microorganisms in natural environments and restored wetlands,"Methane is an important greenhouse gas contributing to global climate change. Natural environments and restored wetlands contribute a large proportion to the global methane budget. Methanogenic archaea (methanogens) and methane oxidizing bacteria (methanotrophs), the biogenic producers and consumers of methane, play key roles in the methane cycle in those environments. A large number of studies revealed the distribution, diversity and composition of these microorganisms in individual habitats. However, uncertainties exist in predicting the response and feedback of methane-cycling microorganisms to future climate changes and related environmental changes due to the limited spatial scales considered so far, and due to a poor recognition of the biogeography of these important microorganisms combining global and local scales. With the aim of improving our understanding about whether and how methane-cycling microbial communities will be affected by a series of dynamic environmental factors in response to climate change, this PhD thesis ...",gnd:4169678-5 gnd:4039226-0 gnd:4124348-1 gnd:4016960-1

Polyelectrolyte multilayers for plasmonics and picosecond ultrasonics,"This thesis investigates the application of polyelectrolyte multilayers in plasmonics and picosecond acoustics. The observed samples were fabricated by the spin-assisted layer-by-layer deposition technique that allowed a precise tuning of layer thickness in the range of few nanometers. The first field of interest deals with the interaction of light-induced localized surface plasmons (LSP) of rod-shaped gold nanoparticles with the particles' environment. The environment consists of an air phase and a phase of polyelectrolytes, whose ratio affects the spectral position of the LSP resonance. Measured UV-VIS spectra showed the shift of the LSP absorption peak as a function of the cover layer thickness of the particles. The data are modeled using an average dielectric function instead of the dielectric functions of air and polyelectrolytes.

Prediction based activation of vehicle safety systems : a contribution to improve occupant safety by validation of pre-crash information and crash severity plus restraint strategy prediction,"The world of transportation is rapidly changing with the introduction of partial autonomy in vehicles and the race between the manufacturers to produce a fully automated passenger vehicle. In addition, to enhance driving comfort and reduce the driving workload, these automated vehicles are also visualized as an approach to reduce the majority of accidents that are caused by human errors. However, accidents do happen and there are also some likelihoods that these automated vehicles might fail. Especially in the initial introductory years, which highlights the need for passive safety systems in safeguarding the occupants. These vehicles typically employ forward-looking sensors for the perception of the surrounding environment, which presents an opportunity to use the information from these sensors to predict an upcoming inevitable crash and further estimate the passive safety action required for the predicted crash in the pre-crash phase.

Bereichsübergreifendes wissenschaftliches Denken in der frühen und mittleren Kindheit - Entwicklungsschritte und Einflussfaktoren,"['Against the background of a growing interest in preschools on science education, the aim of this dissertation project was to contribute to a differentiated understanding of the development of childrens scientific reasoning in early and middle childhood. The focus was on domain-general scientific reasoning, that is the abilitiy to use and understand the process of making scientific findings. The dissertation starts with a chapter on the theoretical background about the development of scientific reasoning from Piaget to the Scientific Discovery as Dual Search (SDDS)- model. Then, two research questions on the development of hypothesis generation, experimentation and evidence evaluation skills are carved out and were tested in two studies. The results showed that these three scientific reasoning components develop asynchronously during early and middle childhood. The ability to evaluate perfect covariation evidence already develops during early preschool age, whereas the ability to evaluate imperfect covariation evidence and experimentation understanding does not emerge until the late preschool years. The ability to flexibly generate and adapt hypotheses according to accumulating evidence emerges at the beginning of adolescence. The theoretical analysis of these results led to the hypothesis that the components develop asynchronously because of different metacognitive demands. This hypothesis was tested in a third study that addressed the prediction of early interindividual differences in experimentation understanding. On the basis of Deanna Kuhns (1999, 2000) theoretical model, it was hypothesized that false-belief understanding could be an important predictor. The results showed a significant predictive relation between false-belief understanding at age 4 and experimentation understanding at age 5. On the basis of the results of all three studies, the SDDS-model and Kuhns (1999, 2000) model, a combined new model on the development of scientific reasoning is suggested. The discussion contains the relation between the combined model and theories on cognitive development, as well as theoretical and methodological points of criticism. The dissertation concludes with suggestions on further research projects and possibilities to implement the results in early childhood education.', 'Das Ziel des Forschungsprozesses, dem die vorliegende Arbeit zugrunde liegt, bestand darin, vor dem Hintergrund einer zunehmenden Fokussierung von Kindertageseinrichtungen auf naturwissenschaftliche Bildungsprogramme zu einer differenzierten entwicklungspsychologischen Betrachtung des wissenschaftlichen Denkens in der frühen und mittleren Kindheit beizutragen. Hierbei wurde das bereichsübergreifende wissenschaftliche Denken, d.h. die Fähigkeit zur Anwendung und das Verständnis für die kindlichen Methoden der Erkenntnisgewinns fokussiert. Zu Beginn der Arbeit wird der theoretische Hintergrund der entwicklungspsychologischen Forschung zum wissenschaftlichen Denken von den Anfängen durch Piaget bis zum Scientific Discovery as Dual Search (SDDS)- Modell dargestellt. Aus den bisherigen Befunden ergaben sich noch offene Forschungsfragen zur Entwicklung der drei Komponenten der Hypothesengenerierung, des Experimentierens und der Evidenzbewertung des SDDS- Modells, die im Rahmen zweier empirischer Studien überprüft worden sind. Die Ergebnisse der beiden Studien zeigten, dass sich die drei Komponenten im Laufe der frühen und mittleren Kindheit asynchron entwickeln. Die Fähigkeit zur Bewertung eindeutiger Evidenzen ist bereits im frühen Kindergartenalter möglich, während die Bewertung uneindeutiger Evidenzen und das basale Experimentierverständnis frühestens am Ende des Kindergartenalters nachweisbar waren. Das flexible Generieren und Adaptieren von Hypothesen an vorgegebene Evidenzen ist erst mit Beginn der Adoleszenz möglich. Die weitere theoretische Analyse dieser Ergebnisse führte zu der Hypothese, dass sich die Komponenten des wissenschaftlichen Denkens aufgrund unterschiedlicher metakognitiver Anforderungen asynchron entwickeln. Diese Hypothese floss in die theoretische Erarbeitung der dritten Studie dieser Arbeit ein, die sich mit dem Versuch einer Erklärung für die Entstehung interindividueller Unterschiede im Experimentierverständnis befasste. Auf der Basis der Modelle von Deanna Kuhn (1999, 2000) wurde das Verständnis falschen Glaubens als mögliche Vorläuferkompetenz des Experimentierverständnisses herausgearbeitet empirisch überprüft. Die Ergebnisse zeigten einen signifikanten prädiktiven Zusammenhang zwischen dem Verständnis falschen Glaubens im Alter von vier Jahren und dem basalen Experimentierverständnis im Alter von fünf Jahren. Auf der Grundlage der Ergebnisse aller drei Studien, des SDDS-Modells und der Modelle von Kuhn (1999, 2000) wurde ein verknüpftes Modell zur Entwicklung des bereichsübergreifenden wissenschaftlichen Denkens formuliert. Anschließend folgt eine Diskussion des verknüpften Modells vor dem Hintergrund ausgewählter Theorien der kognitiven Entwicklung, sowie der Erörterung theoretischer und methodischer Kritikpunkte.

Radiative transfer modeling of outbursts of massive young stellar objects,"Young stellar objects (YSOs) accrete up to half of their material in short periods of enhanced mass accretion. These episodic accretion outbursts imply afterglows, which are observable at IR wavelengths (sometimes even years after the end of the burst). They are caused by the reprocessing of the burst energy within the dense natal environments of the YSOs. Bursts can impact the surrounding cloud core on all scales, from the innermost tens of au (dust sublimation), up to a few hundreds and 1000 au (disk, the site of possible planet formation), and the more extended cloud core (reservoir of cold dust). For massive YSOs (MYSOs), accretion outbursts are of special importance, as they serve as diagnostics in highly obscured regions. Only since 2015 six MYSO bursts have been discovered. Within this work, two outbursting MYSO's within different evolutionary stages, the young source G358.93-0.03 MM1 and the more evolved one G323.46-0.08, are investigated, and the major burst parameters are derived. For both sources, follow-up observations with the airborne SOFIA observatory were performed to detect the far infrared afterglows. All together, we took three burst-/post-observations. The burst parameters are needed to understand the accretion physics and to conclude on the possible triggering mechanisms behind it. Up to today, G323's burst is the most energetic one ever observed for a MYSO (with a released energy of $\approx 10^{47}, \rm erg$). G358's burst was about two orders of magnitude weaker and shorter (2 months instead of 8 years). We suggest that G358's burst was caused by the accretion of a spiral fragment (or a small planet), where G323 accreted a heavy object (a planet or even a potential companion). To model those sources, we use radiative transfer (RT) simulations (static and time-dependent). Additionally, we develop (and benchmark) a Python routine (TFitter), which allows to fit various epochs. This is the first work to apply time-dependent RT to a real MYSO.",gnd:4183546-3 gnd:4057364-3 gnd:4130446-9

"Wege zur Artenkenntnis : eine Untersuchung mit Schülerinnen und Schülern der Mittelstufe im Kanton Bern, Schweiz","[""The loss of biodiversity is a global threat and, despite widespread agreement on the urgency of action, the loss is progressing. The protection and conservation of biodiversity is therefore regarded as one of the most urgent environmental tasks, but this cannot be done without the involvement of the public. However, especially in highly industrialized countries perception and knowledge of species is low. In consequence, people may not be able to recognize the ongoing loss of biodiversity. Little is known about the extent and quality of species education in primary schools in Switzerland and the promotion of species knowledge by families and others. In the present research project, four complementary studies were carried out to investigate how familiar primary-school students in the Canton of Berne are with local plant and animal species and how knowledge of species develops. For the first time, pictures of a large number of species (69 plant and 67 animal species) were presented to 241 primary-school students in the Canton of Berne and their 14 teach-ers. Participants were asked to indicate whether they felt familiar with the species presented and, if so, to identify the organisms by their common name. Moreover, data about students' age, gender, place of living, and nature experiences were collected. Guided interviews were used to investigate how students learn about species, what characteristics they look at when identifying plants and animals, and for how important they consider species knowledge to be. Overall, 47 of the 241 primary-school students participated in this part of the project. Five years later, 22 of the original 241 students were asked again about their species knowledge and its general relevance. There was a positive correlation between the correct naming of plant and animal species among both students and their teachers. Dandelion (Taraxacum officinale), forest straw-berry (Fragaria vesca), raspberry (Rubus idaeus), great nettle (Urtica dioica) and horse chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum) were the most often correctly named plant species, while red fox (Vulpes vulpes), hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus), dwarf bat (Pipistrellus pipistrellus), hare (Lepus europaeus) and wild boar (Sus scrofa) were the most often correctly named animal species. With increasing age of the children, species knowledge decreased. Boys could correctly identify more animal species than the girls. Children who spoke neither German nor Swiss-German with their parents at home, and children who investigated nature, plants and animals, and typical features of organisms mainly at school, had the lowest knowledge of species. The presence of trees and a garden, the responsibility for living creatures, and the naming of local plants and animals by adults fostered species knowledge. Teachers could identify more plants and animals than their students. The older and thus more experienced they were, the more species they could correctly name. However, there was no significant correlation between the number of plant and animal species correctly identified by the teachers and that of their students. When children became acquainted with plants, they mainly remembered sensual experiences such as unpleasant encounters with stinging nettles, but also the preparation of meals. In case of animals, they especially mentioned observations that they had made alone or with other people. Parents and grandparents helped more than school or the media in getting to know species. There was a positive correlation between children's knowledge of species and the number of characteristics they used when describing a plant or an animal. In case of plants, children paid particular attention to stems, hairs, leaves or fruits and less to flowers. Determination aids for children should thus place more emphasis on vegetative than generative parts of plants. Compared to plants, children mentioned more features when describing animals. However, scientifically important characteristics, such as the three-part nature of the insect body, were not part of the children's descriptions. In both the first study and the follow-up five years later, most children considered species knowledge important. They wanted to know local species as they regarded it as part of their general education and as useful. About three-quarters of students in the follow-up survey knew more plant and animal species than five years before, which is probably due to their personal interest. The results show that children's attention to characteristics of plants and animals is closely linked to their knowledge of species and thus to the perception of diversity in nature. The family environment is very important for getting to know species. If this is not the case, schools must take on this task more intensively in order to contribute to an understanding of biological diversity. The imparting of organismic knowledge in pre-service and in-service teacher education plays thus an important role."", 'Der Rückgang an biologischer Vielfalt ist eine weltweite Bedrohung und trotz weitrei-chender Zustimmung zur Dringlichkeit von Maßnahmen schreitet der Verlust voran. Der Schutz und Erhalt biologischer Vielfalt wird deshalb als eine der dringendsten Umweltaufgaben angesehen, was allerdings nicht ohne Einbezug der Öffentlichkeit geschehen kann. Untersuchungen zeigen aber, dass vor allem in hochindustrialisierten Ländern die Wahrnehmung von Arten gering ist und möglicherweise dazu führt, dass Menschen den schleichenden Verlust an biologischer Vielfalt gar nicht erkennen. Über den Umfang und die Qualität von artenkundlichem Unterricht in der Primarschule in der Schweiz und die Förderung von Artenkenntnissen durch die Familie und andere Personen ist allerdings nur sehr wenig bekannt. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wurde deshalb in vier komplementären Studien untersucht, welche Pflanzen und Tiere des Siedlungsraums Schülerinnen und Schüler der Mittelstufe im Kanton Bern kennen und wie sich Artenkenntnis entwickelt. Erstmals wurden mit Hilfe einer großen Zahl an Arten (69 Pflanzen- und 67 Tierarten), die als Bilder vorgelegt wurden, die Artenkenntnisse von 241 Schülerinnen und Schülern der Mittelstufe im Kanton Bern und ihrer 14 Lehrpersonen ermittelt. Neben soziodemografischen Daten wurden zudem auch die Naturerfahrungen der Kinder erhoben. Weiterhin wurde mit Hilfe leitfadengestützter Interviews untersucht, welche Erfahrungen 47 Schülerinnen und Schüler, die bereits an der Fragebogenstudie teilgenommen hatten, beim Kennenlernen von Arten machen, auf welche Merkmale sie sich dabei stützen und für wie bedeutsam sie Artenkenntnisse halten. Zudem wurden nach fünf Jahren 22 Schülerinnen und Schüler der ersten Kohorte erneut zu ihrer Artenkenntnis und der Bedeutung von Artenkenntnissen befragt. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass zwischen der korrekten Benennung von Pflanzen- und Tierarten sowohl bei den Schülerinnen und Schülern als auch bei ihren Lehrpersonen ein positiver Zusammenhang bestand. Am häufigsten wurden von den Kindern Löwenzahn (Taraxacum officinale), Wald-Erdbeere (Fragaria vesca), Himbeere (Rubus idaeus), Große Brennnessel (Urtica dioica) und Rosskastanie (Aesculus hippocastanum) korrekt benannt. Bei den Tieren waren es Rotfuchs (Vulpes vulpes), Igel (Erinaceus europaeus), Zwergfledermaus (Pipistrellus pipistrellus), Feldhase (Lepus europaeus) und Wildschwein (Sus scrofa). Mit zunehmendem Alter der Schülerinnen und Schüler nahm die korrekte Benennung der Pflanzen- und Tierarten im Querschnittvergleich ab, wobei Jungen eine bessere Kenntnis der vorgelegten Tierarten hatten als Mädchen. Kinder, die mit beiden Elternteilen weder Deutsch noch Schweizerdeutsch sprachen, und Kinder, die ihre Naturerfahrungen, Begegnungen mit Pflanzen und Tieren und die Auseinandersetzung mit spezifischen Merkmalen der Lebewesen hauptsächlich im schulischen Kontext gemacht hatten, wiesen die niedrigste Artenkenntnis auf. Das Vorhandensein von Bäumen und einem Garten, die Verantwortung für Lebewesen und die Benennung von Pflanzen und Tieren durch Erwachsene im engeren Umfeld war für die Artenkenntnis förderlich. Die Lehrpersonen konnten deutlich mehr Pflanzen, aber auch mehr Tiere korrekt benennen als ihre Schülerinnen und Schüler. Je älter und damit berufserfahrener eine Lehrperson war, desto besser war ihre Kenntnis der gezeigten Pflanzen- und Tierarten. Zwischen der Anzahl der durch die Lehrpersonen korrekt benannten Pflanzen- und Tierarten und derjenigen ihrer Schülerinnen und Schüler bestand allerdings kein signifikanter Zusammenhang. Mit dem Kennenlernen von Pflanzen verbanden die Kinder vor allem sinnliche Erlebnisse wie zum Beispiel den unangenehmen Kontakt mit Brennhaaren. Sie erinnerten sich aber auch an die Zubereitung von Gerichten aus Kräutern. Mit dem Kennenlernen von Tieren verbanden die Kinder vor allem Beobachtungen, die sie alleine oder mit anderen Personen gemacht hatten. Eltern und Großeltern halfen beim Kennenlernen von Arten mehr als die Schule oder die Medien. Es bestand ein positiver Zusammenhang zwischen der Artenkenntnis der Kinder und der Anzahl Merkmale, mit denen sie die Arten beschreiben konnten. Bei den Pflanzen achteten die Kinder vor allem auf den Stängel, die Behaarung, die Blätter oder die Früchte und weniger auf die Blüte. Bestimmungshilfen für Kinder sollten deshalb stärker auch vegetative Pflanzenteile in den Vordergrund stellen. Bei den Tieren wurde deutlich, dass die Kinder mehr Merkmale als bei den Pflanzen beschreiben konnten, dass aber fachwissenschaftlich entscheidende Merkmale für die Bestimmung, wie die Dreiteiligkeit des Insektenkörpers, für Schülerinnen und Schüler keine auffälligen Merkmale darstellten. Die Kenntnis einheimischer Pflanzen- und Tierarten schätzte die Mehrheit der befragten Kinder zum ersten Befragungszeitpunkt, aber auch fünf Jahre später als wichtig ein. Sie wollten häufige Arten des Siedlungsraums kennenlernen, da es zur Allgemeinbildung dazugehöre und auch nützlich sei. Dass in der Erhebung nach fünf Jahren drei Viertel der Jugendlichen eine bessere Kenntnis der ihnen vorgelegten Pflanzen- und Tierarten aufwiesen, ist vermutlich in ihrem persönlichen Interesse begründet. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die Aufmerksamkeit der Kinder für Merkmale von Pflanzen und Tieren eng mit ihrer Artenkenntnis und damit mit der Wahrnehmung von Vielfalt in der Natur verbunden ist. Das familiäre Umfeld ist für das Kennenlernen von Arten sehr wichtig. Fällt es weg, muss die Schule diese Aufgabe verstärkt wahrnehmen, um so zu einem Verständnis von biologischer Vielfalt beizutragen. Der Vermittlung organismischer Kenntnisse in der Aus- oder Weiterbildung von Lehrpersonen kommt deshalb eine wichtige Rolle zu.']",gnd:4053369-4 gnd:4131912-6 gnd:4601495-0 gnd:4054365-1 gnd:4180040-0

Compression-decompression of multivariate data via maximum entropy resampling and applications to inference,"Abstract: Individual Person Data (IPD) typically consists of repeated independent observations of a multi-dimensional dependent record. Imagine collection of a multi-variate medical record (age, height, health-status, etc ...) on several unrelated patients. IPD sharing is crucial for scientific advance- ment, that is, for experimental validation, evidence pooling, and reliable statistical inferences. While IPD disclosure is feasible it is sometimes difficult or impossible. If IPD is not available researchers still try to recover original information from disclosed IPD syntheses. For instance in meta-analysis we often focus on appraisal and combination of disclosed regression slopes. This is sometimes equivalent to perform the original pooled IPD regression but generally it is not. The implicit question is how much information about the original IPD, and IPD inference, the IPD syntheses do convey. The general opinion is that non negligible information loss should occur. Here we propose a new paradigm by which appraisal of certain IPD summaries, that is IPD marginal moments and correlation matrix, seems to generally entail small information loss at both the data and inferential level. The idea is to reconstruct original IPD from the above summaries only, and to recover an original IPD inference from such reconstructed IPD. We argue this ap- proach is well founded in an information theoretic sense which seems not fully acknowledged in the literature so far. The reconstruction method is based on maximum entropy (MaxEnt ) resampling where the basic MaxEnt formalism is extended to include record dependence by the aide of copula theory. We argue the Gaussian copula with given moment-based MaxEnt marginals and correlation matrix equals the multi-variate MaxEnt distribution from which stochastic simulations of the original IPD are drawn. By an extension of the renowned Gibbs conditioning principle there are strong hints the used Gaussian copula is asymptotically equal to the true IPD generating mechanism, given summaries on its empirical distribution. We verify such claims experimentally. So far this seems one of the strongest arguments for an objective method of IPD reconstruction from IPD summaries only. Next we build a MaxEnt bootstrap estimator by using the proposed MaxEnt joint distribution as plug-in approximation for the IPD generating process, under conditions on its empirical sum- maries. We give hints of MaxEnt bootstrap consistency and argue for good pre ...",gnd:4195680-1

Strategies to cope with risks of uncertain water supply in spate irrigation systems,"Flood based irrigation in particular spate irrigation relies on variable flood scenarios occurring every year. Management of spate flood for spate irrigation must cope with the variability and uncertainty of water supply. Coping with water supply risks is often the only way to harness the opportunities for a productive use of water in arid environment. Integrating and strengthening community responses into irrigation policies and improvement plans could ensure sustainable and productive spate irrigated systems that can achieve food security for the poor population. This research analyses and evaluates risks and coping strategies developed by farming communities in the Gash spate irrigation system in Sudan, Eastern Africa. The research has synthesized different coping strategies developed by farmers, water user associations and water managers to cope with low, high and untimely flood risks. The research provides different frameworks that can assist with the identification of risk sources, pathways and propagation as well as evaluation of locally developed strategies at field, secondary and intake systems. The findings of this study contribute to the scarce knowledge on spate irrigation systems and provide scientifically sound and evidence-based insights to aid informed policy and decision making to improve productivity and sustainability of the spate irrigation systems",gnd:4145122-3
Compact XUV and X-Ray sources from laser-plasma interactions : theoretical and numerical study,"In this thesis the generation of high order harmonics of ultrashort and high intensity laser pulses from solid density plasmas, so called surface high harmonic generation (SHHG), is studied. With SHHG, a compact source of coherent XUV and X-Ray radiation becomes possible. The results are obtained numerically using 1D and 2D Particle-In-Cell (PIC) computer simulations, which are supported by analytical models. This work focusses on two main issues of SHHG to date, pulse isolation and generation efficiency. It is shown that a single attosecond pulse (AP) can be obtained from a few-cycle incident laser pulse by choosing a suitable carrier-envelope phase (CEP), depending on the density and shape of density gradient of the target. An analytical model providing an interpretation of the results obtained from PIC simulations is presented. Spatial isolation of APs can be achieved using the attosecond lighthouse effect, but surface denting is detrimental to the separation of APs. PIC simulations are used to explain an experimental result, where a separation of pulses was not possible due to surface denting. Furthermore it is shown that the angular spectral chirp corresponds to the depth of the surface denting. The efficiency of SHHG can be enhanced greatly by reflecting the beam coming from a first target off a second target. Of major importance for the efficiency is the relative phase between harmonics on the surface of the second target. The relative phase changes even when propagating in free space due to the Gouy phase. To maximize the efficiency gain, a parametric study using PIC simulations has been performed to find the optimal distance between two targets.",gnd:4046259-6 gnd:4034610-9 gnd:4264163-9
Confident metabolite structure annotation with COSMIC,"Small molecules are key to biomarker discovery, drug development, toxicity screenings of ecosystems like rivers and lakes, and many more important research areas in multiple life sciences. Elucidating the exact structure of these metabolites is often crucial in determining their functionality, however, confident annotation of these structures remains a major challenge. To analyse samples of small molecules occurring in nature, mass spectrometry is the currently predominant technique. While mass spectrometry is used to measure the mass of a compound, tandem mass spectrometry can be used to additionally measure the mass of its fragments. The resulting spectral data however is highly non-trivial to interpret. This bottleneck accelerates the development of computational tools to annotate metabolite structures from mass spectrometry data, which enables rapid, large-scale structure annotation independent from spectral libraries. These tools return some proportion of incorrect annotations, which can vastly outnumber correct annotations. Scientists using these tools need to be able to differentiate correct from incorrect annotations. We develop an E-value computation that is based on proxy decoys drawn from the PubChem database and show that this E-value score outperforms the current CSI:FingerID hit score for the task of separating correct from incorrect annotations. To further improve on this, we develop a Percolator inspired machine learning approach, where we train linear support vector machines for this separation task. The confidence score outperforms the original CSI:FingerID hit score, the E-value score and all other tools that participated in the CASMI 2016 contest by a wide margin. Arguably, our confidence score enables confident structure annotation for a relevant portion of a dataset for the first time.

Entwurf und Modellierung eines mikroakustischen Sensors zur Analytik in Flüssigkeit,"[""Zusammenfassung: The objective of this thesis is the design and modeling of an acoustic sensor for the detection of chemical or biological substances in liquid. The principle of such acoustic sensors is based on the direct binding of an analyte on a sensitive layer, which is deposited on the oscillating sensor surface. In principal, no further laboratory equipment is needed for this detection procedure, and it is therefore well suited for portable low cost rapid tests. Admittedly, the applicability of available sensors for non-standarized liquids is limited, since the physical properties of the liquid contribute to the measurement result. In this work a microacoustic sensor is proposed, which could be more suitable for non-standarized liquids. This novel sensor construction is based on the flexural plate wave device, which was introduced in 1987 by White [WWa87], and used in its  primary design since that time. Because of the particular properties of the flexural wave, this type of sensor is very well suited for multiparametric sensing, that is the measurement of liquid properties and mass deposition at the same time. This novel sensor design should eliminate serious disadvantages of the existing design. In the construction proposed here, the electrodes are not deposited on the membrane, but are buried in the membrane. Thereby the electromechanical coupling is improved and the transducer is electrically shielded. Due to the perfect shielding, both sides of the membrane can be used for sensing and the sensor can be completely embedded in the fluid. The theoretical advantages are the increase in sensitivity and electromechanical coupling, the reduction of electrical cross talk, and the minimized disturbances arising from pressure fluctuations across the membrane. Thus, the signal to noise ratio and the detection limit should be improved.In this work simple sensor structures were designed with the purpose of process development, which was done by Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Solid State Physics Freiburg. However, the focus of this work is on the analytical modeling of wave propagation. Analytical models of flexural plate wave devices were reported in the 80's and are based on Euler-Bernoulli plate theory [WW88b]. The accuracy of Euler-Bernoulli model is certainly only sufficient for low propagation speeds and therefore not suited for new concepts like the multiparametric sensing approach or miniaturization by utilization of small wavelengths.In this work  ..."", 'Zusammenfassung: Gegenstand dieser Dissertation ist die Entwicklung und Modellierung eines akustischen Sensors zum Nachweis von chemischen oder biologischen Substanzen in Flüssigkeit. Das Prinzip solcher akustischen Sensoren beruht auf der direkten Bindung eines Analyts an eine sensitive Schicht, die auf der schwingenden Sensoroberfläche aufgebracht ist. Für dieses direkte Nachweisverfahren sind im Prinzip keine weiteren Laborapparate notwendig und es ist deshalb besonders gut für preisgünstige und tragbare Schnelltests geeignet. Allerdings ist der Anwendungsbereich vorhandener Sensoren bei nicht standardisierten Flüssigkeiten eingeschränkt, weil die physikalischen Eigenschaften der Flüssigkeit in das Analyseergebnis eingehen.In dieser Arbeit wird ein mikroakustischer Sensor vorgeschlagen, der besser zur Analytik von nicht standardisierten Flüssigkeiten geeignet sein könnte.Der mit dieser Arbeit erstmals vorgeschlagene mikroakustische Sensor baut auf den piezoelektrischen Membranbiegeschwingern auf, die 1987 von White [WWa87] erstmals beschrieben wurden und seither in nahezu unverändertem Aufbau genutzt werden.

Towards clinical translation of raman spectroscopy for tumor cell identification,"In the modern world, cancer is one of the leading causes of death, and its early diagnostics remains one of the big challenges. Since cancer starts as a malfunction on the cellular level, the diagnostic techniques have to deal with single cells. Detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs), which are present in the patient's blood, holds promise for the future theranostic applications, as CTCs represent the actual state of the primary tumor. Raman spectroscopy is a label-free technique capable of non-destructive and chemically-specific characterization of individual cells. In contrast to marker-based methods, the CTCs detected by Raman can be reused for more specific single-cells biochemical analysis methods.  This thesis focuses on technological developments for Raman-based CTC identification, and encompasses the whole chain of involved methods and processes, including instrumentation and microfluidic cell handling, automation of spectra acquisition and storage, and chemometric data analysis. It starts with a design of custom application-specific instruments that we used to evaluate and optimize different experimental parameters. A major part is software development for automated acquisition and organized storage of spectral data in a database. With the automated measurement systems and the database in place, we were able to collect about 40.000 Raman spectra of more than 15 incubated cancer cell lines, healthy donor leukocytes, as well as samples originating from clinical patients. Additionally, the thesis gives an overview of data analysis methods and provides an insight into the underlying trends of the dataset. Although the cell identification models could not reliably differentiate between individual cancer cell lines, they were able to recognize tumor cells among healthy leukocytes with prediction accuracy of more than 95%. This work demonstrated an increase in the throughput of Raman-based CTC detection, and provides a basis for its clinical translation.",gnd:4186433-5 gnd:4176916-8 gnd:4803438-1 gnd:4462534-0

The H3+ + H2 isotopic system : origin of deuterium astrochemistry,"Dense cold molecular clouds reckoned to be stellar nurseries are the scene of an extreme molecular deuteration. Despite the cosmic D/H ratio of 10^{-5}, molecular species in prestellar cores are observed to contain nearly as much deuterium as hydrogen. This astonishing deuterium enrichment promoted by low temperatures is the work of H3+. It is the key species which unlocks the deuterium from its HD reservoir via reactions like H3+ + HD -> H2D+ + H_2 and drags it further to other species in successive reactions. For this reason, the H3+ + H2 isotopic system is outstandingly critical for the astrochemistry of cold environments. However, its understanding is yet incomplete and insufficient.

Solar activity reconstruction from historical observations of sunspots,"The solar activity and its consequences affect space weather and Earth’s climate. The solar activity exhibits a cyclic behaviour with a period of about 11 years. The solar cycle properties are governed by the dynamo taking place in the interior of the Sun, and they are distinctive. Extending the knowledge about solar cycle properties into the past is essential for understanding the solar dynamo and forecasting space weather. It can be acquired through the analysis of historical sunspot drawings. Sunspots are the dark areas, which are associated with strong magnetic fields, on the solar surface. Sunspots are the oldest and longest available observed features of solar activity. One of the longest available records of sunspot drawings is the collection by Samuel Heinrich Schwabe during 1825–1867. The sunspot sizes measured from digitized Schwabe drawings are not to scale and need to be converted into physical sunspot areas. We employed a statistical approach assuming that the area distribution of sunspots was the same in the 19th century as it was in the 20th century.

"Seasonal, physiological and genetic functions in Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, at different latitudes in the Southern Ocean","[""Light regime and the endogenous timing system of Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, are known to play important roles in the regulation of its seasonal cycles of growth, maturity, metabolic activity and gene expression. This dissertation aimed to investigate the effect of different latitudinal light regimes on the seasonal cycle of Antarctic krill. It comprised two main parts: a) a field study with the goal to characterize seasonal processes on the molecular level in Antarctic krill in different latitudinal regions (Publication 1), and b) a two-year laboratory study under constant food and temperature conditions that tested the effect of the latitudinal light regimes 52¡S, and 66¡S, and constant darkness on the seasonal cycle of Antarctic krill (Publication 2 & 3). Our results suggest that the seasonal timing system of Antarctic krill is highly plastic, thereby promoting regional acclimatization to different latitudinal light regimes. We further discuss that the internal 'photoperiodic-controlled' seasonal cycles in Antarctic krill may be adjusted by other environmental cues like temperature and food supply in the field. <engl.>"", 'Lichtregime und die endogene Zeitgebung des antarktischen Krills spielen eine wichtige Rolle bei der Regulierung der saisonalen Zyklen von Wachstum, sexueller Reife, metabolischer Aktivität und Genexpression.

Discovery of Single Top Quark Production,""" The top quark is by far the heaviest known fundamental particle with a mass nearing that of a gold atom. Because of this strikingly high mass, the top quark has several unique properties and might play an important role in electroweak symmetry breaking-the mechanism that gives all elementary particles mass. Creating top quarks requires access to very high energy collisions, and at present only the Tevatron collider at Fermilab is capable of reaching these energies. Until now, top quarks have only been observed produced in pairs via the strong interaction. At hadron colliders, it should also be possible to produce single top quarks via the electroweak interaction. Studies of single top quark production provide opportunities to measure the top quark spin, how top quarks mix with other quarks, and to look for new physics beyond the standard model. Because of these interesting properties, scientists have been looking for single top quarks for more than 15 years. This thesis presents the first discovery of single top quark production.  It documents one of the flagship measurements of the D0 experiment, a collaboration of more than 600 physicists from around the world. It describes first observation of a physical process known as """"single top quark production"""", which had been sought for more than 10 years before its eventual discovery in 2009. Further, his thesis describes, in detail, the innovative approach Dr. Gillberg took to this analysis. Through the use of Boosted Decision Trees, a machine-learning technique, he observed the tiny single top signal within an otherwise overwhelming background.

Auswirkungen von H2- und CO2- Untergrundspeicherungen auf die Reservoireigenschaften von Sandsteinen : mineralogische Untersuchungen und hochauflösende Computertomographie Modellierungen aus HPHT Autoklaven-Laborexperimenten,"This study was conducted as part of the research project -Hydrogen to Store- (H2STORE) with the focus of potential reactions of reservoir sandstones and formation fluids exposed to injected hydrogen and carbon dioxide. Therefore sandstone samples of three Rotliegend drilling wells and one Buntsandstein bore hole were investigated because these stratigraphic units form the most important underground storage sites in Germany. The material was provided by industrial partners. The characterization of lithological, petrographical and geochemical features as well as the microscopical documentation (by Field Emission-Scanning Electron Microcopy - FE-SEM, Digital Microscope System - DMS, Atomic Force Microscopy - AFM) of mineral surfaces, measurements of specific surface areas and of petrophysical properties (porosity, permeability) and high resolution computed tomography (μ-CT) associated with numerical simulations were conducted before and after static autoclave experiments to evaluate potential reactions induced by these tests. The experiments are performed under specific reservoir conditions (reservoir pressure, reservoir temperature, formation fluid composition) combined with H2 or CO2 exposure and running times of four to seven weeks. After the autoclave experiments the dissolution of pore-filling carbonate, anhydrite and barite (only after H2 experiments) is established, as shown by geochemical and hydrochemical data, µ-CT scans and microscopic sample surface studies by FE-SEM, AFM and DMS. The variation of mineral surfaces and the dissolution of pore-filling cements increased the size of specific surfaces areas and modified the petrophysical properties of the sandstones. These results in a variation of the size and direction of fluid pathways and in pore size distribution are also simulated by μ-CT data. The modelled results of these analyses are in good agreement with the measured results achieved by conventional experimental methods (He-porosity, N2-permeability).",gnd:4173962-0 gnd:4321528-2 gnd:4113240-3 gnd:4170297-9 gnd:4127360-6

Monitoring of boreal forests in Siberia : integrating ground and satellite (C- and L-band SAR) data,"Anthropogenic climate change constitutes one of the main global crises in the 21st century. It manifests itself distinctly in global warming and its effects. Forests play an essential role in mitigating the effects of climate change, improving our knowledge of the distribution and changes of terrestrial carbon stocks is vital to mitigate its consequences. Therefore, remote sensing is recommended as one of the tools to ensure systematic and operational forest monitoring. Forests in the Russian Federation are of particular importance as it is the most forested country in the world and at the same time, it is the country with the highest uncertainty when calculating global carbon stocks. Remote sensing is recommended as one of the tools to ensure systematic and operational forest monitoring. It can acquire data over large areas with a high repetition rate and at a relatively low cost. In particular, microwave sensors are recommended as they can provide weather and sun independent, systematic observations with high temporal frequency. The main goal of this cumulative dissertation was to develop methods using new algorithms for estimating parameters for boreal forests from remote sensing data acquired with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). Using the SAR data acquired by the sensor with the longest wavelength available at the moment of writing this dissertation in space, the L-band, methods for estimating the above-ground forest biomass were developed. For this purpose, algorithms for machine learning (ML) were applied and validated. These methods were chosen because they are recommended for large data sets and an incomplete theoretical understanding of processes, e.g., the interaction between the forest and the radar signal, and are relatively new in forest monitoring studies. In addition, efforts have been made to establish improved mapping of large-scale forest cover change.",gnd:4064354-2 gnd:4195782-9 gnd:4006877-8 gnd:4176765-2 gnd:4016796-3 gnd:4291501-6

Collaborative projects became an important part for creating intelligent solutions, but are also challenging due to heterogeneous and knowledge-intensive relations.

The dissertation sheds light on how and to what extent heterogeneous project partners integrate knowledge from each other to develop innovation. My research revealed that knowledge integration is confronted with diverse knowledge boundaries.

"Functional traits of salt marsh plants : responses of morphology- and elemental-based traits to environmental constraints, trait-trait relationships and effects on ecosystem properties","['In this thesis, the responses of plant traits on environmental constraints were evaluated and the most responsive plant traits were identified and tested for their applicability to trait-environmental concepts. Trait-trait relationships were investigated and the effects of plant traits on ecosystem properties were assessed. The study was conducted in salt marshes along the mainland coast of Northwest Germany and on the island of Mellum. The most important findings were that nutrient availability and water-related environmental conditions most strongly influence trait expressions of salt marsh plants. Morphology-based traits were partly different from those of other terrestrial plants and trait-trait relationships of elemental-based traits were consistent to the findings of other studies. Different plant traits were found to affect different ecosystem properties. Therefore, multifunctionality of salt marshes can only be ensured by conserving functional diversity via species diversity. <engl.>', 'In der vorliegenden Arbeit wurden Merkmalsausprägungen von Pflanzen als Antwort auf Umwelteinflüsse untersucht und die Anwendbarkeit dieser auf Merkmals-Umwelt Konzepte überprüft.

Idee und Gestalt einer Schule im Urteil des Elternhauses : eine Dokumentation über die Odenwaldschule zur Zeit ihres Gründers und Leiters Paul Geheeb (1910 - 1934),"['What attitude did parents take towards the Odenwaldschule established by Paul Geheeb in 1910 and run, together with his wife Edith, nee Cassirer, until 1934? The thesis responds to that question by providing the results of research into the letters exchanged between parents and school authorities, kept in school archives. It was rather fortunate that the pupils\' files did not only contain the letters written by parents but in most cases also carbon copies of the replies by the school heads. The central theme of a short first paragraph is the parents\' reaction to the ""Gestalt"" of the school, i.e. its geographical situation, its setting in a rural landscape and the outer and inner appearance of the twelve buildings which the school complex comprised at the time. The main part of this dissertation focuses on the circumstances that affected the way in which the school community lived and worked, as those conditions made the idea of a new pedagogical concept come true, thus providing the background to an analytical appraisal by the parents related with the school. Therefore a connection is established between two spheres: 1} Paul Geheeb\'s perspective on the following issues: - What was his approach to the concept of ""school""? - What was his type of school to be for the children and adolescents entrusted to his care? - What model of learning and education did he follow? - What picture of humankind served him as guideline? - How did he translate his ideas into action? and 2)the parents\' attitude expressed in the answers to the following questions: - What in particular made parents send their children to this independent school? - What was their understanding of education and learning based on? - How did mothers and fathers judge the pedagogic scheme pursued by the school their children attended? - Why did some parents actively support the Odenwaldschule and cooperate with the Geheebs while others turned passionate opponents of the couple and their educational policies? The last chapter provides insight into the relations between the parents and the Odenwaldschule at the time of political turmoil. It presents the parents\' reactions to the events of the years 1932/33, to Paul Geheeb\'s closing the school in 1934 as well as to its re-establishment as ""Gemeinschaft der Odenwaldschule"". It finally deals with the question how parents received the news of the Geheebs\' emigration to Switzerland where they founded the ""Ecole d\'Humanité"", a successor to the Odenwaldschule.', 'Wie standen Eltern von Schülerinnen und Schülern der 1910 von Paul Geheeb gegründeten und mit seiner Frau Edith, geb. Cassirer, bis 1934 geleiteten Odenwaldschule in Oberhambach bei Heppenheim/Bergstraße gegenüber? Diese Frage beantwortet die Dissertation mit Ergebnissen aus der Aufarbeitung des im Archiv der Odenwaldschule lagernden Briefwechsels zwischen Elternhaus und Schule. Als Glücksfall erwies sich die Tatsache, dass die Schülerakten nicht nur die Schreiben der Erziehungsberechtigten, sondern in den meisten Fällen auch Durchschläge der Antwortbriefe des Schulleiterehepaares enthalten. Ein kurzer erster Teil thematisiert die Reaktion der Eltern auf die ""Gestalt"", d.h. das Erscheinungsbild der damals aus zwölf Gebäuden bestehenden Schule. Den Hauptteil der Ausführungen stellt das Erfassen der Lebenswirklichkeit der Schulgemeinschaft dar, liefert diese doch als Realisierung einer reformpädagogischen ""Idee"" die Folie für die Analyse ebendieser Wirklichkeit durch die mit ihr verbundenen Elternhäuser. Es werden somit zwei Komplexe miteinander in Beziehung gebracht: 1) die Perspektive Paul Geheebs unter folgenden Gesichtspunkten: - Wie sah seine Idee einer Schule aus? - Was sollte seine Schule für die ihm anvertrauten Kinder und Jugendlichen sein? - Weichem Bildungs- und Erziehungsbegriff folgte er? - Von welchem Menschenbild ließ er sich leiten? - Wie setzte er seine Idee in die Praxis um? und 2) die Haltung der Eltern in der Antwort auf folgende Fragen: - Was veranlasste Eriehungsberechtigte, ihre Kinder gerade in diese Reformschule zu schicken? - Welches Verständnis von Erziehung und Bildung lag diesem Schritt zugrunde? - Wie beurteilten Väter und Mütter den an der Schule ihrer Kinder beschrittenen reformpädagogischen Sonderweg? - Weshalb wurden manche Eltern zu tatkräftigen Kooperationspartnern und andere zu erbitterten Kontrahenten der Geheebs und ihrer Schule? Ein letztes Kapitel informiert über das Verhältnis zwischen Elternhaus und Schule zur Zeit des politischen Umbruchs mit elterlichen Reaktionen auf Ereignisse der Jahre 1932/33, die 1934 durch Paul Geheeb erfolgte Schließung der Odenwaldschule, deren Fortführung als ""Gemeinschaft der Odenwaldschule"" und die Emigration Paul und Edith Geheebs in die Schweiz, wo sie mit ihrer ""Ecole d\'Humanité"" eine Nachfolgeschule der Odenwaldschule gründeten.']",gnd:4511937-5

Detection and Kirchhoff-type migration of seismic events by use of a new characteristic function,"The classical method of seismic event localization is based on the picking of body wave arrivals, ray tracing and inversion of travel time data. Travel time picks with small uncertainties are required to produce reliable and accurate results with this kind of source localization. Hence recordings, with a low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) cannot be used in a travel time based inversion. Low SNR can be related with weak signals from distant and/or low magnitude sources as well as with a high level of ambient noise. Diffraction stacking is considered as an alternative seismic event localization method that enables also the processing of low SNR recordings by mean of stacking the amplitudes of seismograms along a travel time function. The location of seismic event and its origin time are determined based on the highest stacked amplitudes (coherency) of the image function. The method promotes an automatic processing since it does not need travel time picks as input data.

Die Rolle von Horizontalzellen und N-Cadherin in der Entwicklung der Photorezeptor-Bandsynapse,"['At the photoreceptor ribbon synapse, photoreceptors transfer light information to horizontal cells and bipolar cells. This thesis aimed to investigate the role of horizontal cells and N-cadherin in the formation of this synapse with the help of horizontal cell-ablated and conditional N-cadherin knock-out mice. Immunohistochemical and electron microscopic analysis of horizontal cell-ablated retinae revealed that photoreceptor terminals were lacking invaginating ON bipolar cell dendrites. Moreover, ribbon assembly and postsynaptic recruitment of mGluR6 and GPR179 was impaired. These findings demonstrate that horizontal cells are essential for the formation of synapses between photoreceptors and ON bipolar cells.

Preschooler’s attachment representations from a triadic perspective : a cross cultural study with Chilean and German families,"The following doctoral thesis pretends to be a contribution in the understanding of child development and family process, specifically of attachment representations during preschool years and family triadic interactions. The research methodology has different steps, from which five manuscripts emerged: two of them accepted for publication and three two of them submitted in research relevant journals. The five papers adopt a common systemic and ecological perspective, are thematically related, and can be divided in three parts. As a first step, it was considered necessary to evaluate in Chile, how parental mental health variables are related to family functioning and to the triad, so the first two articles referred to those topics. The third manuscript is a literature review and it evidenced the importance of paternal involvement in child development and proposes a triadic perspective in analyzing family interactions, and the last two articles incorporate sociocultural variables, searching for predictors for the triad and for the preschooler’s attachment representations in Chilean and German families. Results showed that, while maternal depressive and stress symptoms relate more to intrafamily and interactional aspects, paternal symptoms relate more to maternal mental health and the presence of environmental risks. Besides, lower levels of family psychosocial risk and more egalitarian sex role ideologies predict more functional triadic interactions. And at last, triadic family interaction and parental stress predict preschooler’s attachment security levels in Chilean and German families, which would indicate the reliability of the proposed model.",gnd:4187713-5 gnd:4188709-8 gnd:4403048-4

The dark side of primary production in temperate forest soils,"Soils are the largest terrestrial organic carbon pool and source of atmospheric CO2 . The fate of organic carbon in soils is chiefly controlled by microbial activities, mainly via mineralization by heterotrophs releasing CO2 . However, before it is released into the atmosphere, a portion of this CO2 is refixed non-phototrophically by chemolithoautotrophic microbes. This process is called dark CO2 fixation, and is expected to not only modulate CO2 fluxes, but also contribute to soil organic carbon (SOC). Thus, CO2 fixation could be linked to the increase of SOC stocks in soils like those of temperate forests, in addition to increased plant inputs. As SOC from plant litter decreases with depth, there is a reduced availability of nutrients for heterotrophs. But since CO2 concentration increases with depth, the relative impact of chemolithoautotrophy likely increases with depth. This is expected to affect SOC and soil CO2 fluxes and might vary with changes in biogeochemical and climatic factors. Thus, quantifying the inputs and chemolithoautotrophic potential for CO2 fixation across temperate forest soil depths and the factors affecting this process, is required to determine its contribution to SOC and soil CO2 fluxes, and its response to shifts in biogeochemical parameters and global climate change. The findings presented in this thesis highlight the contributions of dark CO2 fixation to SOC by recycling CO2 produced from soil respiration across temperate forest soil profiles. Dark CO2 fixation is likely a ubiquitous process among temperate forest soil microbiome and not restricted to chemolithoautotrophs. It is influenced by changes in geochemical parameters like SOC and pH. As CO2 fixation also responds to higher CO2 concentration and temperature, this thesis further highlights that dark CO2 fixation might be affected by global climate change.",gnd:7745707-9 gnd:4039226-0 gnd:4164199-1 gnd:4210099-9 gnd:4007348-8

"Community, structure, activity and ecophysiology of sulfate-reducing bacteria in deep tidal flat sediments","[""Enhanced pore water exchange facilitates the transport of pore water to deep, sandy sediments and may provide microbial communities with usable substrates. In this thesis sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) were shown to be highly abundant and metabolically active in down to 5 meters depth of a tidal sand flat (German Wadden Sea). The majority of the isolated and quantified SRB were members of two widely distributed phylogenetic groups within the Deltaproteobacteria. Many cultured representatives as well as the isolates from this study are able to utilize a broad spectrum of organic substrates as electron and carbon sources. They can also grow by fermentation and therefore probably gain sufficient energy to survive under these uncomfortable conditions. The high abundance of SRB, seasonal changes in pore water sulfate, elevated cell numbers and activity of SRB supported the hypothesis that pore water and metabolic products are transported to deep sediments. In conclusion, deep sediments of tidal sand flats were shown to be potential 'hot spots' of microbial activity and have a remarkable impact on organic matter degradation and recycling of nutrients. <engl.>"", ""Advektiver Transport von Porenwasser in sandigen Sedimenten ermöglicht die Versorgung mikrobieller Gemeinschaften mit Substraten.

Entwicklung von quantenmechanischen Simulationsmethoden zum computergestützten Materialdesign,"Computationally aided development of novel materials requires an efficient and reasonably accurate simulation methods capable of describing both molecular as well as extended systems on an equal footing. Therefore, the methodological part of this thesis is devoted to an efficient implementation of density functional theory within the TURBOMOLE program package, which enables simulations of both molecules and extended systems under periodic boundary conditions on an equal footing. Specifically, my contribution has been the improvement of efficiency and usability of the program by addressing its bottlenecks, extension to open shell systems and implementation of analytical energy gradients. In particular, an efficient, octree-based continuous fast multiple method has been implemented in order to significantly speed up Coulomb energy and gradient calculation. With the improved efficiency and usability this implementation has been applied to atomic level structural characterization of ZnO and CdO nanoclusters. As the result, not only new structures are discovered, but it is also possible to demonstrate that their extraordinary long-lived excited states are due to electron–hole pair localization combined with structural rigidity of the nanoclusters. Finally, mixed ZnO-TiO2 nanoclusters as well as ZnO clusters adsorbed on the anatase (101) surface have been investigated. Striking structural similarities between structures of mixed ZnO-TiO2 and pure TiO2 clusters are found. In case of ZnO nanoclusters adsorbed on the anatase surface a significant reduction of the band gap of the system is shown.

Such enzymes are hydroxybenzoic acid and phenolic acid (de)carboxylases, which catalyze reversible carboxylations and can be differentiated according to their regio-selectivity based on which the carboxylic group is added and removed: ortho and para, for phenolic compounds, and beta, for hydroxycinnamic acids. Because carbon dioxide and its hydrated form, bicarbonate, have considerably low standard Gibbs free energies, the equilibrium of the reactions often lie strongly on the decarboxylation side in physiological conditions. In this work, two ortho- (de)carboxylases and one beta-(de)carboxylase were studied in the reaction directions relevant for application. For ortho-selectivity, dihydroxybenzoic acid (de)carboxylases –from Rhizobium sp. and Aspergillus oryzae– were studied in the synthesis –“up-hill”– direction, which yields salicylic acids from phenols. This reaction resembles the abiotic Kolbe-Schmitt synthesis, which is conducted at elevated temperatures and pressures. Therefore, the establishment of an “enzymatic counterpart” for large scale production is highly desirable in order to achieve efficient CO2 utilization for chemical synthesis. Fundamental studies on kinetics and thermodynamics revealed the reactions bottlenecks, allowed the proposition and verification of a catalytic mechanism and gave new insights on the biocatalysts’ substrate spectra. The development of an amine-coupled method to use carbon dioxide –instead of bicarbonate, the effective co-substrate usually accepted by these biocatalysts– reveled interesting properties of ammonium ions in determining approximately five-fold increases in reaction rates and approximately two-fold equilibrium conversions for the carboxylation of catechol. Moreover, the analyses of strategies to overcome the thermodynamic equilibrium are critically discussed and demonstrate how the system may have a realistic future only on the laboratory scale. Beta-(de)carboxylases catalyze the reversible (de)carboxylation on the C–C double bonds of abundant and naturally occurring para-hydroxycinnamic acids yielding para-hydroxystyrenes, which are normally obtained by using multistep synthesis, toxic reagents and high temperatures. Therefore, these enzymes represent a promising tool for the deoxygenation of biomass-derived feedstocks. In the present work, a phenolic acid (de)carboxylase from Mycobacterium colombiense was studied as biocatalyst for the decarboxylation of ferulic acid, yielding 4-vinylguaiacol, an Food and Drug Administration-approved flavoring agent. Kinetic studies revealed the occurrence of strong product inhibition, which was then tackled by performing the biotransformation in two liquid-phase systems. The optimized reaction conditions using hexane as the organic phase were demonstrated also in gram scale, affording the target product in 75% isolated yield. A reactor concept including the integrated product separation is also presented and discussed. In order to further exploit this biocatalytic reaction for applications, a sequential Pd-catalyzed hydrogenation step was carried out in the organic layer, affording 4-ethylguaiacol, another industrially relevant flavoring agent. In gram scale, the whole reaction sequence afforded the final product in 70% isolated yield. Both biotransformation and chemo-enzymatic sequence were evaluated using the E-factor as a measurement of their environmental impact; a comparison with existing synthetic paths shows how the strategies developed in this work are promising “green” methods in view of large scale applications.', 'Kohlenstoffdioxid dient als Schlüsselkomponente im biotischen Stoffwechsel sowie in der abiotischen, chemischen Synthese. Mit einigen Ausnahmen können beide Bereiche zusammengeführt werden, indem im Hinblick auf industrielle Anwendungen Biokatalysatoren für (De)Carboxylierungs-Reaktionen zur Beschleunigung von chemischen Reaktionen eingesetzt werden. Einige Lyasen, die bezüglich phenolischer Ausgangsstoffe diese katalytische Aktivität aufweisen, sind an mikrobiellen Abbauprozessen beteiligt. Die Hydroxybenzoesäure- und Phenolsäure- (De)Carboxylasen katalysieren reversible Carboxylierungs-Reaktionen und werden anhand ihrer Regioselektivität bezüglich der Addition oder Abspaltung einer Carboxylgruppe differenziert: ortho und para für phenolische Komponenten und beta für Hydroxyzimtsäuren. Aufgrund der geringen freien Standard Gibbs-Energien von Kohlenstoffdioxid und seiner hydrierten Form als Hydrogencarbonat liegt das Gleichgewicht der Reaktionen unter physiologischen Bedingungen häufig deutlich auf der Seite der Decarboxylierung. In dieser Arbeit wurden zwei ortho- (De)Carboxylasen und eine beta-(De)Carboxylase untersucht, wobei für die Richtung der Reaktion die Relevanz für industrielle Anwendungen im Fokus stand. Bezüglich der ortho-spezifischen Selektivität wurden Dihydroxybenzoesäure-(De)Carboxylasen von Rhizobium sp. und Aspergillus oryzae in die sogenannte Syntheserichtung („uphill“) untersucht, wodurch Salizylsäuren als Produkt ausgehend von Phenol gewonnen werden. Diese Reaktion ähnelt der abiotischen Kolbe-Schmitt Synthese, die unter erhöhten Temperaturen und Drücken durchgeführt wird. Daher ist es wünschenswert, ein alternatives Konzept unter Einsatz von Enzymen (“enzymatic counterpart“) im großen Maßstab zu etablieren, um eine effiziente CO2-Nutzung zu ermöglichen. Durch detaillierte Studien der Kinetik und Thermodynamik wurden Einschränkungen der Reaktionen aufgezeigt, der katalytische Mechanismus beschrieben und verifiziert, sowie neue Einblicke in das Substratspektrum der Biokatalysatoren gewonnen. Die Entwicklung einer Amin gekoppelten Methode zur Nutzung von Kohlenstoffdioxid (anstatt von Bicarbonat, welches das effektive Cosubstrat der betrachteten Biokatalysatoren ist) zeigte einerseits erhöhte Reaktionsgeschwindigkeiten des Ammonium-Ions (ca. 5-fach) und andererseits höhere Gleichgewichts-Umsätze (ca. doppelt so hoch) für die Carboxylierung von Catechol. Darüber hinaus wurden Strategien zur Verschiebung des thermodynamischen Gleichgewichts diskutiert und ein Lösungsansatz für den zukünftigen Einsatz des Systems im Labormaßstab vorgestellt. Beta-(De)Carboxylasen katalysieren hingegen die reversible (De)Carboxylierung einer C–C-Doppelbindung natürlich vorkommender (und reichlich vorhandener) para-Hydroxyzimtsäuren. Als Produkt werden in diesen Reaktionen para-Hydroxystyrole erhalten, die in einem mehrstufigen chemischen Prozess unter Einsatz von toxischen Reagenzien bei hohen Temperaturen synthetisiert werden. Daher stellt die Anwendung der genannten Enzyme eine vielversprechende Möglichkeit zur Deoxygenierung aus Biomasse basierten Rohstoffen dar. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wurde zur Decarboxylierung von Ferulasäure eine Phenolsäure-(De)Carboxylase aus Mycobacterium colombiense untersucht, um den von der Food and Drug Administration genehmigten Aromastoff 4-Vinylguaiakol als Produkt zu gewinnen. In kinetischen Studien konnte eine starke Produktinhibierung beobachtet werden, welche durch die Überführung der Biotransformation in ein Zwei-Phasensystem umgangen werden konnte. Unter optimierten Reaktionsbedingungen mit Hexan als organischer Phase wurde das Zielprodukt mit einer isolierten Ausbeute von 75% im Gramm-Maßstab gewonnen. Zudem wurde ein Reaktorkonzept mit integrierte Produktabtrennung präsentiert und diskutiert. Um die biokatalytische Reaktion im Hinblick auf Anwendungen zu untersuchen, wurde eine sequentielle, Pd-katalysierte Hydrogenierung in der organischen Phase durchgeführt. Dadurch wurde 4-Ethylguaiakol als weiterer industriell relevanter Aromastoff mit einer isolierten Ausbeute von 70% im Gramm- Maßstab synthetisiert. Sowohl die Biotransformation, als auch die chemoenzymatische Sequenz wurden auf Basis des E-Faktors als Maß für den Umwelteinfluss bewertet.

"Pitch of voiced speech in the short-time fourier transform : algorithms, ground truths, and evaluation methods","['This dissertation investigates algorithms for estimating pitch in the human voice. Many such algorithms exist, and claim to be accurate even in high levels of noise. Pitch, however, is a human percept that strictly speaking only exists in the human brain, and is not directly available for testing algorithms. Evaluating algorithm accuracy is therefore difficult, and highly dependent on the choice of truth used for comparison. This dissertation introduces a new pitch estimation algorithm for the human voice that is accurate and robust to noise, proposes a new pitch ground truth that is a better fit for the task than previous truths, and evaluates existing pitch estimation algorithms in a comparison study of unprecedented scope. The results of this comparison reveal a surprising amount of hidden bias in existing speech corpora, as well as evaluation methods. Thus, the choice of algorithm should be highly dependent on the expected signals, with no one clear best choice for all applications.', 'Diese Dissertation untersucht Algorithmen zum Schätzen der Tonhöhe menschlicher Sprache.

"From the inside out : colloidal CdSe/CdS semiconductor nanorods : a study on the influence of their structures, surface ligands, and interactions with Redox-Active (Poly)Dopamine","The main focus of this thesis was the preparation of using nanorods (NRs) as photosensitizers, and divided into three chapters, where the structure of CdSe/CdS NRs, the phase transfer of CdSe/CdS dot-in-rod NRs and the interactions between dot-in-rod NRs and dopamine / polydopamine were discussed. Larger influence of surface defect was discovered in the inside-out NRs in the photoluminescence spectroscopy then further confirmed in the transient absorption spectroscopy. The phase transfer of the dot-in-rod NRs was successful monitored by FT-IR. And the influence of surface electron trap (ns scale) and hole trap (ps scale) was discovered in photoluminescence spectroscopy then further confirmed in time-resolved emission spectroscopy and transient absorption spectroscopy. The interaction between NRs and dopamine or polydopamine differed from surface ligands. With MUA ligand, the quenching mechanism was electron transfer which was further confirmed by transient absorption spectroscopy on the polydopamine coated MUA-NRs. With HS-PEG-OCH3 ligand, the quenching mechanism was more likely to be hole transfer.",gnd:4386873-3 gnd:7574326-7

Cognitive processing in behavior-based perception of autonomous off-road vehicles,"This work addresses the environmental recognition of autonomous off-road vehicles. Algorithms, like deep learning, offer impressive performance regarding the classification and segmentation of a scene. However, context changes, scene variabilities, or disturbances pose significant challenges to these approaches and cause perception failures. A challenge is achieving the universal applicability of perception algorithms. Usually, an algorithm fails in particular situations due to unconsidered circumstances in the design phase, and complexity prevents fully considering all details. Accordingly, this thesis aims to increase the perception s robustness through context and data incorporation. Furthermore, it derives concepts for transferring methods to other robots and scenes. A hint that such a task is achievable provides human cognition, which is remarkably skillful and adjusts to arbitrary situations. Biologically motivated perception and cognitive research indicate how an achievable perception design might function, leading to guidelines for artificial perception conception. The paradigm of behavior-based systems suits these criteria due to modularity, reactivity, and robustness. It allows realizing robust and transferable perception and control systems.Consequently, the thesis proposes a novel and reconfigurable behavior-based top-down and bottom-up perception approach. Quality assessment for data filtering and deviation control is a central aspect, resulting in improved perception and data fusion results. Attentional processing allows for selecting data based on attractiveness, task, environmental context, and history. Further, context assessment of classification results enables reasoning according to the robot s memories and knowledge. Validation uses five demonstrator vehicles operating in diverse environments and fulfilling distinct tasks. Here, a robust performance was achievable, and perception adjusted well to the tested scenes and hardware layouts",gnd:7714938-5 gnd:4261462-4

Novel Ru-photosensitizer as versatile building blocks for (molecular) architectures,"Ruthenium polypyridyl complexes are interesting for a wide range of applications. The incorporation of ruthenium complexes as modular units in larger hierarchical architectures represents a promising approach for improvements of well-known materials as shown by the formation of metallopolymeric films for catalysis and the synthesis of redox active polymeric donor-photosensitizer-acceptor triads for the conversion of light into chemical bond energy. The construction of such large well-defined architectures by convential synthetic pathways results in a large synthetic effort so that a new efficient strategy had to be developed. The stepwise assembly, where the redox active units can be used like a construction kit provides a facile access to a modular use in which single parts can be exchanged without the repetition of the complete synthesis. Hence, capable synthetic pathways for the single units as well as the coupling step are required. The chemistry-on-the-complex methodology offers an alternative pathway to classical procedures and, thus, guarantees a modular assembly. In this thesis, an efficient synthetic strategy for the assembly of polymeric D-P-A systems was presented. Therefore, the usage of the [Ru(dqp)2]2+ photosensitizer was incorporated into a D-P-A triad. In this regard the application of the complex in the architectures required the preservation of the photophysical and electrochemical behavior of the complex, which can be influenced by the functionalization. Spectroscopic measurements were investigated to confirm this preservation.",gnd:4175236-3 gnd:4266702-1 gnd:4386873-3
Dynamische Regel-und Reserveleistungsvorhaltung in zukünftigen Smart Grids,"['To ensure a constant power frequency the permanent balance of power demand and supply is the most crucial constraint in an electrical power system. Therefore there is a need for reserve and balancing power to cover prediction-deviations or unpredictable events.

Propagation of partially coherent light in optical systems,"There are in general three approaches to propagate partially coherent light. They include solving the Helmholtz equations for the correlation function, employing the Wigner function to propagate light in phase space, or using modal expansion. In this work, we investigate the interaction of partially spatially coherent light with optical systems. Our modeling methods are based on the Wigner function and modal expansion.  First, we utilize the thin element approximation in the Wigner function to propagate partially coherent light through discontinuous surfaces. Our examples include the phase step, grating, kinoform lens, axicon and lens array. Phase space provides a vivid picture for understanding the diffraction effects, e.g. the diffracted orders formed by a grating, the multiple foci of a kinoform lens, and the beam homogenizing effect of a lens array, etc. This approach facilitates the design of diffractive elements and the interpretation of optical effects. Second, we improve the propagation algorithms for the Wigner function. These implementations include removing a parabolic wavefront of a beam, and an efficient propagator based on rotating the phase space. Both algorithms increase the computational speed without losing any physical accuracy. To overcome certain limitations of our phase space propagators, we investigate the modal expansion method. We use Schell beams as examples, to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of eigenmode and shifted-elementary mode expansions. Afterward, we develop an expansion tool to efficiently propagate partially coherent light inside waveguides. This tool allows quick access to the light fields at any distance inside the waveguide. We thus obtain an accurate modeling of the diffraction effects produced by the waveguide structure. Our modeling methods pave the path to the experimental measurement of coherence. We discuss two schemes to retrieve the spatial coherence of a beam under test. The first scheme is to solve an inverse problem of the modal expansion. It requires iterative phase retrieval algorithms to recover the complex fields of individual modes. We extend this method to a beam with an arbitrary wavefront and discuss the potential and limits of this technique. The second scheme for coherence retrieval is to solve the inverse problem of the Wigner function, also known as the phase space tomography. To reconstruct a Wigner function requires an inverse Radon transform in a four-dimensional space. We present an overview of the two relevant algorithms, i.e. the filtered back projection and the ambiguity function reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose an improved algorithm for the filtered back projection.",gnd:4519405-1 gnd:4267405-0 gnd:4159528-2 gnd:4158821-6 gnd:4258960-5 gnd:4195918-8
"Das Wirken Gottes innerhalb eines evolutiven Weltbildes : Systematische Theologie, Naturwissenschaften und Religionspädagogik im Dialog","['For centuries, a religious and scientific world view seemed to be contradicting. Since the middle oft the 20th century the two disciplines have gradually approached. Meanwhile, the very vivid interdisciplinary dialogue considers reality as too complex to be explained by only one of the two sciences. In theology, theories of evolution are not regarded as a threat to the Christian belief in creation although the biblical world view is not based on evolutionary ideas. However, only little research has been conducted on the consequences for the doctrine of God. Thus, current catholic and protestant systematic theology is intensively involved in the debate of how to appropriately think and speak about God within an evolutionary context. A changed understanding of God on the basis of an evolutionary world view has to be taken into consideration not only by systematic theology but also by both religious educational theory and a modern concept of religious education in practice. The chosen research approach unfolds God’s action from the point of view of creation and considers the question from both the perspective of systematic theology and religious education.', 'Jahrhundertelang schien es, als wären das religiöse und naturwissenschaftliche Weltbild nicht miteinander zu vereinbaren. Seit Mitte des 20. Jahrhunderts sind die Fronten zwischen Theologie und Naturwissenschaften deutlich aufgebrochen. Der inzwischen sehr lebendig geführte interdisziplinäre Dialog basiert auf der Einsicht, dass die Wirklichkeit viel zu komplex ist, als dass es nur einen möglichen Zugang zu ihr geben könnte. In der Theologie hat sich darum schon seit längerer Zeit die Erkenntnis durchgesetzt, dass die Evolutionstheorie keine Bedrohung des christlichen Schöpfungsglaubens darstellt, auch wenn das biblische Weltbild nicht mit Hilfe evolutiver Kategorien formuliert wurde. Allerdings wurde bislang nur in einzelnen Ansätzen weitergedacht, welche Konsequenzen sich daraus für die Gotteslehre ergeben. So führt die gegenwärtige katholische wie evangelische systematische Theologie einen intensiven Diskurs um die Art und Weise, wie im Kontext eines evolutiven Weltbildes angemessen von Gott zu denken und zu sprechen ist und inwiefern sich eine solche Gottesrede von Beschreibungen des Wirkens Gottes in der traditionellen Theologie unterscheiden muss. Diese Problematik ist zugleich von religionspädagogischer Relevanz, denn ein verändertes Gottesverständnis auf dem Hintergrund des evolutiven Weltverständnisses kann weder in der religionspädagogischen Theoriebildung noch in der inhaltlichen und didaktischen Konzeption eines zeitgemäßen Religionsunterrichts ignoriert werden. Der gewählte Forschungsansatz entfaltet das Wirken Gottes von der Schöpfung her und bedenkt die Fragestellung zugleich aus systematisch-theologischer und aus religionspädagogischer Perspektive. Dabei sollen Religionspädagogik und Systematik in einen Dialog treten, der zu einem beidseitigen Erkenntnisgewinn beiträgt.']",gnd:4049412-3 gnd:4023277-3 gnd:4021662-7 gnd:4041421-8

In the first area, on the Higgs inflation scenario, the author successfully improves a large value problem on a coupling constant relevant to the Higgs mass in the Standard Model, in which the coupling value of the order of 105 predicted in a conventional scenario is reduced to the order of 10. This result makes the Higgs inflation more attractive because the small value of coupling is natural in the context of ultraviolet completion such as string theory. In the second area, the author provides a new answer to the naturalness problem, of why the cosmological constant and the Higgs mass are extremely small compared with the Planck scale. Based on the baby universe theory originally proposed by Coleman, the smallness of those quantities is successfully explained without introducing any additional new particles relevant at the TeV energy scale.']",gnd:7589166-9 gnd:4297710-1 gnd:4209328-4 gnd:4398783-7 gnd:4571605-5
Non-langevin recombination in fullerene and non-fullerene acceptor solar cells,"Organic solar cells (OSCs), in recent years, have shown high efficiencies through the development of novel non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs). Fullerene derivatives have been the centerpiece of the accepting materials used throughout organic photovoltaic (OPV) research. However, since 2015 novel NFAs have been a game-changer and have overtaken fullerenes. However, the current understanding of the properties of NFAs for OPV is still relatively limited and critical mechanisms defining the performance of OPVs are still topics of debate.

The work is comprised of four closely linked studies. The first is a detailed exploration of the fill factor (FF) expressed in terms of transport and recombination properties in a comparison of fullerene and non-fullerene acceptors.

Vrs4 may also regulate SISTER OF RAMOSA3 (HvSRA), a putative trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase involved in trehalose-6-phosphate homeostasis, implicated to control spikelet determinacy.

Fast and accurate supertrees : towards large scale phylogenies,"Phylogenetics is the study of evolutionary relationships between biological entities; phylogenetic trees (phylogenies) are a visualization of these evolutionary relationships. Accurate approaches to reconstruct hylogenies from sequence data usually result in NPhard optimization problems, hence local search heuristics have to be applied in practice. These methods are highly accurate and fast enough as long as the input data is not too large. Divide-and-conquer techniques are a promising approach to boost scalability and accuracy of those local search heuristics on very large datasets. A divide-and-conquer method breaks down a large phylogenetic problem into smaller sub-problems that are computationally easier to solve. The sub-problems (overlapping trees) are then combined using a supertree method. Supertree methods merge a set of overlapping phylogenetic trees into a supertree containing all taxa of the input trees. The challenge in supertree reconstruction is the way of dealing with conflicting information in the input trees. Many different algorithms for different objective functions have been suggested to resolve these conflicts. In particular, there are methods that encode the source trees in a matrix and the supertree is constructed applying a local search heuristic to optimize the respective objective function. The most widely used supertree methods use such local search heuristics. However, to really improve the scalability of accurate tree reconstruction by divide-and-conquer approaches, accurate polynomial time methods are needed for the supertree reconstruction step. In this work, we present approaches for accurate polynomial time supertree reconstruction in particular Bad Clade Deletion (BCD), a novel heuristic supertree algorithm with polynomial running time. BCD uses minimum cuts to greedily delete a locally minimal number of columns from a matrix representation to make it compatible. Different from local search heuristics, it guarantees to return the directed perfect phylogeny for the input matrix, corresponding to the parent tree of the input trees if one exists. BCD can take support values of the source trees into account without an increase in complexity. We show how reliable clades can be used to restrict the search space for BCD and how those clades can be collected from the input data using the Greedy Strict Consensus Merger. Finally, we introduce a beam search extension for the BCD algorithm that keeps alive a constant number of partial solutions in each top-down iteration phase. The guaranteed worst-case running time of BCD with beam search extension is still polynomial. We present an exact and a randomized subroutine to generate suboptimal partial solutions. In our thorough evaluation on several simulated and biological datasets against a representative set of supertree methods we found that BCD is more accurate than the most accurate supertree methods when using support values and search space restriction on simulated data. Simultaneously BCD is faster than any other evaluated method. The beam search approach improved the accuracy of BCD on all evaluated datasets at the cost of speed. We found that BCD supertrees can boost maximum likelihood tree reconstruction when used as starting tree. Further, BCD could handle large scale datasets where local search heuristics did not converge in reasonable time. Due to its combination of speed, accuracy, and the ability to reconstruct the parent tree if one exists, BCD is a promising approach to enable outstanding scalability of divide-and-conquer approaches.",gnd:4611085-9 gnd:4076110-1

Antibacterial Mg-Ag biodegradable alloys,"The use of magnesium alloys as degradable metals for biomedical applications is topic of ongoing research. As a further aspect, the demand for multifunctional materials is increasing. Hence, binary Mg-Ag alloys were designed to combine the favourable properties of magnesium with the wellknown antibacterial property of silver. In this study, three Mg-Ag alloys, Mg2Ag, Mg4Ag and Mg6Ag which contain 1.87%, 3.82% and 6.00% silver by weight respectively were casted and processed with solution and aging heat treatment. Afterwards, the samples were investigated in vitro for metallographic, mechanical, corrosive, cytocompatible and antibacterial properties. The metallurgical analysis and phase identification showed that all alloys contained Mg4Ag as the dominant second phase. The mechanical properties of the Mg-Ag alloys were dramatically improved in several parameters especially after heat treatment. Corrosion tests revealed that after heat treatment, content of silver reduced the corrosion rate and exhibited less susceptibility to pitting corrosion than pure magnesium. Mg(OH)2 and MgO presented as main magnesium corrosion products while AgCl was found as the primary silver corrosion product. Immersion tests demonstrated that content of silver did not significantly shift the pH, osmolality and magnesium ion release in the environment. Cultivation and cytotoxicity tests with both primary cells and cell lines revealed that Mg-Ag alloys induce no negative effect on cells and show minor cytotoxicity. Antibacterial testing in a dynamic bioreactor system proved the alloys to reduce the viability of two common pathogenic bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. In summary, biodegradable Mg-Ag alloys are cytocompatible biomaterials with adjustable mechanical and corrosion properties while having sound antibacterial ability.",gnd:4511937-5

Boundary value problems on manifolds with singularities,"In the thesis there are constructed new quantizations for pseudo-differential boundary value problems (BVPs) on manifolds with edge. The shape of operators comes from Boutet de Monvel’s calculus which exists on smooth manifolds with boundary. The singular case, here with edge and boundary, is much more complicated. The present approach simplifies the operator-valued symbolic structures by using suitable Mellin quantizations on infinite stretched model cones of wedges with boundary. The Mellin symbols themselves are, modulo smoothing ones, with asymptotics, holomorphic in the complex Mellin covariable. One of the main results is the construction of parametrices of elliptic elements in the corresponding operator algebra, including elliptic edge conditions.",gnd:4048395-2 gnd:4047640-6 gnd:4044779-0
Bayesian methods for small molecule identification,"Confident identification of small molecules remains a major challenge in untargeted metabolomics, natural product research and related fields. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry is a predominant technique for the high-throughput analysis of small molecules and can detect thousands of different compounds in a biological sample. The automated interpretation of the resulting tandem mass spectra is highly non-trivial and many studies are limited to re-discovering known compounds by searching mass spectra in spectral reference libraries. But these libraries are vastly incomplete and a large portion of measured compounds remains unidentified. This constitutes a major bottleneck in the comprehensive, high-throughput analysis of metabolomics data. In this thesis, we present two computational methods that address different steps in the identification process of small molecules from tandem mass spectra. ZODIAC is a novel method for de novo — that is, database-independent — molecular formula annotation in complete datasets. It exploits similarities of compounds co-occurring in a sample to find the most likely molecular formula for each individual compound. ZODIAC improves on the currently best-performing method SIRIUS; on one dataset by 16.5 fold. We show that de novo molecular formula annotation is not just a theoretical advantage: We discover multiple novel molecular formulas absent from PubChem, one of the biggest structure databases. Furthermore, we introduce a novel scoring for CSI:FingerID, a state-of-the-art method for searching tandem mass spectra in a structure database. This scoring models dependencies between different molecular properties in a predicted molecular fingerprint via Bayesian networks. This problem has the unusual property, that the marginal probabilities differ for each predicted query fingerprint. Thus, we need to apply Bayesian networks in a novel, non-standard fashion. Modeling dependencies improves on the currently best scoring.",gnd:4037882-2 gnd:1138059420 gnd:4611085-9
Memetic algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems : fitness landscapes and effective search strategies,"For many combinatorial optimization problems, no effective algorithms capable of finding guaranteed optimum solutions in short time are available. Therefore, powerful heuristics have been developed that deliver no guarantee to find the optimum, but have shown to be highly effective in many test cases. In this work, a special class of heuristics is investigated. The algorithms under consideration are called memetic algorithms, which are  roughly speaking  hybrids of evolutionary algorithms and problem-specific search algorithms, such as greedy heuristics and local search. In order to provide explanations under which circumstances these memetic algorithms are highly effective, a search space analysis relying on the concept of fitness landscapes is conducted, consisting of an autocorrelation analysis and a fitness distance correlation analysis of the peaks in the fitness landscape. It is shown that the former type of analysis enables a comparison and thus a selection of local search algorithms, while the latter type of analysis provides a guideline for the choice of evolutionary variation operators in the evolutionary meta-algorithm. The search space analysis is conducted for five combinatorial optimization problems, namely the traveling salesman problem, the graph bipartitioning problem, the quadratic assignment problem, NK landscapes, and the unconstrained binary quadratic programming problem. Based on the results of the analysis, new memetic algorithms are presented. Experimental results demonstrate that they are among the best heuristics developed so far for the five problems.",gnd:4625421-3 gnd:4024772-7 gnd:4031826-6 gnd:4132315-4
Methods for mobile robot localization using architectural floor plans,"Abstract: In the near future, mobile robots are envisioned to autonomously operate in many complex scenarios such as assembly lines, warehouses, or domestic environments for assisting or even replacing people in repetitive and tedious tasks. In this context, robot localization is a crucial technology for every mobile vehicle to be fully operational. Localization methods commonly rely on accurate maps that are built fusing sensory measurements collected with the sensor modality on board the robot. To build those maps, robots have to be teleoperated through the entire area where they are required to operate, which in turn results in increased deployment time and costs for robot manufacturers, or additional effort for customers. In addition, map representations such as occupancy grids, can be hard to interpret for inexperienced operators. To overcome these drawbacks, in this dissertation we investigate methods for mobile robot localization using 2D architectural floor plans. In this thesis, we first propose a robust LiDAR-based system that uses architectural floor plans as map for localization. During operation, the robot builds and maintains an accurate representation of the environment while keeping it aligned to the floor plan. This allows the robot to cope with occlusion produced by obstacles and large structures that are not represented in the floor plan and which can significantly affect localization methods that only compare the current LiDAR measurements with the floor plan. Second, we propose a monocular camera-based localization system. Instead of creating map of the environment during navigation, we employ a Convolutional Neural Network to estimate room layout edges from single monocular images. To track the robot pose, we use Monte Carlo Localization and compare the estimated layout with a 3D model inferred from the 2D floor plan. The methods proposed in this dissertation have been evaluated using real-world datasets in order to assess their robustness and accuracy as well as their computational performance. The experiments show that the methods can be used in complex scenarios, such industrial and service applications",gnd:4167607-5 gnd:7569134-6

Improved classification rates for localized algorithms under margin conditions,"['Support vector machines (SVMs) are one of the most successful algorithms on small and medium-sized data sets, but on large-scale data sets their training and predictions become computationally infeasible. The author considers a spatially defined data chunking method for large-scale learning problems, leading to so-called localized SVMs, and implements an in-depth mathematical analysis with theoretical guarantees, which in particular include classification rates. The statistical analysis relies on a new and simple partitioning based technique and takes well-known margin conditions into account that describe the behavior of the data-generating distribution. It turns out that the rates outperform known rates of several other learning algorithms under suitable sets of assumptions. From a practical point of view, the author shows that a common training and validation procedure achieves the theoretical rates adaptively, that is, without knowing the margin parameters in advance.

Prospects for Biochar in a Bio-Waste Cascade,"In the early 2000s the pre-Columbian, anthropologically produced black soil in the Amazon basin, „Terra Preta de Índio“, received greater scientific attention. Compared to the surrounding poor soils, this very fertile anthrosol contains significantly higher levels of microorganisms and nutrients. The reason for this was determined to be the likewise high levels of charred biomass. This stable carbon, now called biochar, has since been intensively examined as an option to improve soil and to store carbon. Although the creation of Terra Preta was most likely based on a purposeful utilization of organic residues from households and gardens, biochar plays no role in the current recycling of bio-waste. However, the implementation of biochar could lead to many improvements. Results from agricultural research suggest that not only the yield capacity of soils can be increased but also the process performance of composting and biogas plants. The latter is especially relevant since currently about 40% of all collected bio-waste in Germany is recycled in an energy-material cascade consisting of anaerobic digestion and composting. The use of biochar in this cascade could then sequentially increase biogas yields, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and improve compost quality. To realize the aforementioned advantages, the concept of biochar has to be integrated into the existing bio-waste cascade as practically as possible. This was done by the development of a theoretical scenario that allowed the analysis of energy and material flows to evaluate biochar’s recycling performance. Furthermore, the legal and economic framework were examined to assess the feasibility of the extended cascade and to suggest possible adjustments to the frameworks.",gnd:4172777-0 gnd:103216963X gnd:4164919-9 gnd:4006796-8
"Soil greenhouse gas (N2O, CO2 and CH4) fluxes from cropland agroforestry and monoculture systems","['Conventional agriculture is the dominant contributor to negative environmental impacts such as the growth in global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and the challenges are likely to increase with the increasing global food demand as well as the agricultural expansion. Agroforestry is a sustainable management practice with strong potential to provide ecosystem services and environmental benefits through increasing carbon sequestration, nutrient availability, water use efficiency and biodiversity, and reducing soil erosion and nitrogen losses. Therefore, the establishment of agroforestry practices offers an opportunity to reduce GHG emissions. Previous studies have showed the effects of agroforestry on soil nitrous oxide (N2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), and methane (CH4) fluxes in many parts of the world. In temperate Europe, the information on the GHG mitigation potential of agroforestry compared to cropland monoculture is still unclear. The present thesis consists of two studies, which was designed to explore whether the conversion of cropland monoculture to agroforestry systems reduces trace gases N2O, CO2, and CH4 emissions from the soil. The study was carried out at three sites varied with soil types in Germany. Each site had adjacent alley cropping agroforestry and cropland monoculture systems and the trees in agroforestry system were planted 1 to 11 years prior to this research. We measured soil N2O, CO2, and CH4 fluxes monthly using vented static chambers at the three sites from March 2018 to January 2020. On each day of gas sampling, soil temperature, water-filled pore space and extractable mineral nitrogen (N) were measured in the top 5 cm.The objective of our first study was to quantify the spatial-temporal dynamics of soil N2O fluxes from cropland agroforestry and monoculture systems, following different crop rotations and fertilization rates. The pattern of soil N2O fluxes were predominantly controlled by soil mineral N in both agroforestry and monoculture systems. The positive relationship between water-filled pore space with soil N2O fluxes during the cropping seasons, indicating soil moisture acts as a limiting factor under N-sufficient conditions. The entire agroforestry systems tended to reduce soil N2O emissions by 9% to 56% compared to monocultures, during the corn phase of the rotation that had typically high fertilization rates. The lowest soil N2O emissions in the unfertilized tree rows (occupied 20% of the agroforestry area) represent a potential for mitigating N2O emissions from croplands.The objective of our second study was to investigate the changes in soil CO2 and CH4 fluxes after conversion from cropland monoculture to alley cropping agroforestry systems. Our results showed that seasonal variations of soil CO2 and CH4 fluxes were strongly regulated by soil temperature and moisture, and the spatial variations were mainly controlled by texture. The establishment of agroforestry systems had no effect on reducing soil CO2 emissions, possibly because there was no significant difference in soil temperature between management systems. Annual soil CH4 uptake in the agroforestry systems was increased by up to 300% compared to monocultures, which may be related to the regulation of trees on soil moisture in agroforestry systems.The present research provides the first insight into the systematic comparison of soil N2O, CO2 and CH4 fluxes from cropland agroforestry and monoculture systems, and it provides a unique dataset for estimating the net balance of carbon emissions after conversion of cropland monoculture to alley cropping agroforestry system in temperate regions. Although soil CO2 emissions showed no differences between management systems, the total annual soil emissions of non-CO2 GHG from agroforestry systems were reduced by 0.22 Mg CO2 eq ha-1 compared to the monocultures. Considering the driving function of soil moisture and mineral N on soil GHG fluxes from cropland agroforestry and monoculture systems, our findings suggest that improved system management (e.g. optimal adjustments of the areal coverages between tree and crop rows) and optimized fertilizer input will enhance the potential of cropland agroforestry for mitigating N2O emissions and increasing CH4 uptake and C sequestration in the long run.$yLinzenz', 'Conventional agriculture is the dominant contributor to negative environmental impacts such as the growth in global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and the challenges are likely to increase with the increasing global food demand as well as the agricultural expansion.

"The evolution of knowledge spaces : innovation, indicators and drivers","This dissertation contributes on assessing how knowledge spaces change over time and on which are the factors driving their development. Technologies in innovation literature are regarded as a collection of combined components. These components are represented in the network form through knowledge spaces. Technologies follow an evolutionary process but the role of technological spaces and their evolution are still aspects not sufficiently developed in literature. The thesis focuses in Chapter 2 on the categorisation of innovation activities. Once the main features of different types of innovations responsible for changes in technological paradigms and therefore in technological spaces have been analysed, the dissertation provides newly crafted indicators to assess their evolution in Chapter 3. The reshaping and evolution of technological spaces is also influenced by some drivers, the focus is on two possible drivers that could influence the evolution of technological spaces. The first external regional driver analysed is cluster policies and the second internal regional driver is the ability of organizations in knowledge recombination activities. In Chapter 4 we measured both short term impacts and long term ones of cluster policies on the evolution of knowledge spaces. The results show that the program contributed both to increase the importance of specific technological fields in winning regions. Chapter 5 recognises the factors that influence the propensity of organizations to combine knowledge differently from others. We found that the orientation towards applied or basic research and the embeddedness in the regional innovation network matter for the way in which technologies are combined. Different empirical methods have been used to produce results spacing from Difference in Difference to Quantitative Text Analysis to Social Network Analysis.

"Tectonic mechanical properties of the Alborz region, Iran","In this study for better analysis of geo-hazard on two parameters were focused: geodynamics and mechanical property of the orogen. The Alborz region in the northern Iran was selected as the study area. The Alborz mountain range in Iran is an ideal object to investigate the potential influence of past tectonic regimes on the future evolution of this long-lived convergence. For this purpose, previous geodynamic results were reviewed and compiled with data on present day tectonic activity at crustal and upper mantle scale. Previously published models indicate that the Iran Plate was subjected to a series of extensional and compressional tectonic regimes, ultimately linked with the opening and closure of the Tethys Ocean and related basins. Two subduction-collision cycles are recognized: one cycle occurred as a result of the subduction of the Iran Plate beneath the Turan Plate and in this cycle the subduction phase ceased in the Cenozoic and since the Cenozoic it is in a collision phase. The other cycle took place as a result of the subduction of the Arabian Plate beneath the Iran Plate, and in this cycle the subduction phase began in the Mesozoic and is ending now. Thus, the current tectonic situation in the Alborz is a direct consequence from the ongoing Cenozoic subduction-collision cycle. GPS and earthquake data indicate that the Alborz region, resulting from the collision of the Iran Plate with the Turan Plate, is still an area of recently active compression. Moho and tomographic data show that there is no connection between slab remnants of the oceanic crust and the Iran Plate. Furthermore, the Moho beneath the central Alborz is about 20 km deeper than in surrounding areas, indicating further advancement of collision there. However, the collision is continuing and the shorted area between the Iran Plate and the Turan Plate may increase. During the crustal thickening, a deep Moho area can also develop. This evolution can be expected in the tectonic cycle between the Arabian Plate and the Iran Plate, and also other places of the Alpine-Himalayan Belt (AHB), such as the Caucasus region.",gnd:4142436-0
Molekularbiologische Analyse des chemischen Abwehrsystems bei Blattkäferlarven (Coleoptera: Chrysomelina) : in vivo Validierung von Enzymen und Transportproteinen an essentiellen Schnittstellen des Defensiv-Metabolismus mittels RNA interference,"The chemical defense of leaf beetle larvae represents a complex system of intercellular transport processes and enzymatic conversions, which often begins already in the secondary metabolism of the plant and ends in the deterrence of a predator, or the inhibition of microbial pathogens. This functions are realized mainly through defensive secretions, which is produced in nine pairs of accessory defense glands in the larval back and is presented as droplets on dorsal papillae in the event of an attack. In earlier work, a highly selective transport system for the chemical precursor and the biosynthetic principles for the generation of the bioactive allomones has been identified. Since usage of plant secondary metabolites for defensive purposes is a quite distributed feature in arthropods, knowledge about the functionality of the system in these beetles, also helps understand other systems. The aim of the thesis was to use the recently generated transcriptome databases of selected species of the subtribe of Chrysomelina, to reveal the molecular base of transport and biosynthesis, which was mainly unknown so far. By establishing and using RNA interference on our model systems Phaedon cochleariae (Fabr.) and Chrysomela populi (L.), proteins from the fat body, the glandular membrane and secreted ones were targeted. By the essential integration of adequate controls for each target transcript and a corresponding analysis strategy, investigating the generated “loss-of-function” phenotypes, transcripts could be identified responsible for certain steps in the defense metabolism. Due to the ongoing sequencing of closely related species, a comparable approach could be done relatively quickly. With the knowledge of the molecular base of the altered defense biochemistry of other species, new insights into the evolution and speciation of the leaf beetles could be obtained.",gnd:4133941-1 gnd:4014988-2

A detailed study of the H.E.S.S. data from the Galactic Center region,"The High Energy Stereoscopic System, H.E.S.S., is an array of four imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes, located in the Khomas highlands of Namibia, designed for the exploration of very high-energy (E > 100 GeV) gamma-ray emission in the universe, arising in non-thermal processes. Its location in the southern hemisphere renders sensitive observations of a large region of the Galactic Plane possible. In particular, a deep exposure of the Galactic Center region allows detailed studies of the observed em ission, helping to identify the sources of the radiation and the physics processes at play. In this thesis, new methods are developed to study both the morphological and spectral properties of diffuse very high-energy gamma-ray emission from the Galactic Center region. Assuming that the radiation originates from hadronic interactions of diffusing cosmic rays with the ambient matter, this study helps to constrain the parameter space of cosmic-ray diffusion in the Galactic Center region. The second part of this work introduces new methods to search for signals of Dark Matter annihilations, putting upper-limits on the production of spectral line features in the H.E.S.S.

Methods and frameworks for GeoSpatioTemporal data analytics,"In the era of social networks, internet of things and location-based services, many online services produce a huge amount of data that have valuable objective information, such as geographic coordinates and date time. These characteristics (parameters) in the combination with a textual parameter bring the challenge for the discovery of geospatiotemporal knowledge.

The model of the hardware component is given in a hardware description language. The entire system is modelled in Simulink. Existing co-simulation methods require a lot of additional computational efforts to synchronise the simulator tools and exchange data between them. The approach presented here is based on a transformation of the hardware model, which allows its execution directly in the context of the Simulink model. As no separate simulator is needed to simulate the hardware component, the overhead for synchronisation and data exchange is reduced significantly. Hence, the overall system simulation becomes faster. In addition, a further optimisation of the simulation performance is presented. The transformed hardware model enables this improvement and is based on skipping phases without state changes in the simulation. <engl.>', 'In dieser Arbeit wird eine Methode zur effizienten Integration von digitalen Hardwarekomponenten in Systemmodelle vorgestellt.

Impact of aquifer heterogeneity on subsurface flow and salt transport at different scales : from a method determine parameters of heterogeneous permeability at local scale to a large-scale model for the sedimentary basin of Thuringia,"More than 70% of the German population rely on groundwater as their daily drinking water supply. Hence, the understanding of processes like fluid flow and solute transport in porous media are of broad relevance. However, subsurface hydrology faces two problems. On the one hand, information about the subsurface structure and hydraulic properties is scarce. On the other hand, many aquifer parameters like the permeability which controls the flow velocity, are heterogeneously distributed in space. This thesis is dedicated to the question of how aquifer heterogeneity impacts on subsurface flow and transport processes at different scales. We first present a large-scale numerical model of the Thuringian basin in order to investigate the mechanisms of saltwater transport. The results underline the fact that permeability and its heterogeneous spatial distribution are decisive factors for the evolving flow and salt patterns. Our results show that the correlation structure and the degree of heterogeneity (variance) impact significantly on the amount of dissolved salt and the location where salt reaches near-surface regions. Thermally induced convection is not present. However, variations in fluid density due to dissolved salt can lead to significant changes in the distribution and amount of salt in the Thuringian Basin. We further focus on a method to determine the statistical parameters which describe the heterogeneous spatial distribution of permeability by analyzing well flow at local scale. This is of interest, because pumping tests are a widely used tool to infer on porous medium characteristics. We derive an analytical solution which describes the drawdown of a steady state pumping test in 3D heterogeneous anisotropic media by making use of upscaling theory. By combining the analytical solution with an inverse estimation strategy we determine the statistical parameters, like mean permeability, variance and correlation length from on-site pumping tests.",gnd:4185932-7 gnd:4057696-6 gnd:4022375-9 gnd:4055202-0
Synthesis of highly fluorinated precursors and their deposition conditions for self-assembled monolayers with defined small-scale surface structures as templates for the manipulation of wetting behavior,"""How Wenzel and Cassie were wrong"" – this was the eye-catching title of an article published by Lichao Gao and Thomas McCarthy in 2007, in which fundamental interpretations of wetting behavior were put into question. The authors initiated a discussion on a subject, which had been generally accepted a long time ago and they showed that wetting phenomena were not as fully understood as imagined. Similarly, this thesis tries to put a focus on certain aspects of liquid wetting, which so far have been widely neglected in terms of interpretation and experimental proof. While the effect of surface roughness on the macroscopically observed wetting behavior is commonly and reliably interpreted according to the well-known models of Wenzel and Cassie/Baxter, the size-scale of the structures responsible for the surface's rough texture has not been of further interest. Analogously, the limits of these models have not been described and exploited.

"Beyond ""trading up"": environmental federalism in the European Union : the case of vehicle emission legislation","This study analyses the stringency of EU environmental regulations. Contrary to the proposition of an economic -trading up- of standards, the positive theory of environmental federalism which is developed allows for an examination of political mechanisms and the effects of regulation. Empirical results of the study of European and national decisions in EU vehicle emission legislation allow for the conclusion that the adoption of strict rules is viable, even in extreme sectoral cases where the industry concerned is economically and politically powerful. The distribution of costs across the industry and EU member states is the central mechanism which provokes strict and lax rules. In vehicle emission legislation, systematic differences between the regulation of CO2 and air pollutant emissions exist.

Topics in Theoretical and Computational Nanoscience : From Controlling Light at the Nanoscale to Calculating Quantum Effects with Classical Electrodynamics,"Interest in structures with nanometer-length features has significantly increased as experimental techniques for their fabrication have become possible. The study of phenomena in this area is termed nanoscience, and is a research focus of chemists, pure and applied physics, electrical engineers, and others. The reason for such a focus is the wide range of novel effects that exist at this scale, both of fundamental and practical interest, which often arise from the interaction between metallic nanostructures and light, and range from large electromagnetic field enhancements to extraordinary optical transmission of light through arrays of subwavelength holes. This dissertation is aimed at addressing some of the most fundamental and outstanding questions in nanoscience from a theoretical and computational perspective, specifically: · At the single nanoparticle level, how well do experimental and classical electrodynamics agree? · What is the detailed relationship between optical response and nanoparticle morphology, composition, and environment? · Does an optimal nanostructure exist for generating large electromagnetic field enhancements, and is there a fundamental limit to this? · Can nanostructures be used to control light, such as confining it, or causing fundamentally different scattering phenomena to interact, such as electromagnetic surface modes and diffraction effects? · Is it possible to calculate quantum effects using classical electrodynamics, and if so, how do they affect optical properties?",gnd:4273564-6
Hydraulic stability of geotextile sand containers for coastal structures : effect of deformations and stability formulae,"['New  shore  protection  structures  such  as  seawalls,  groins,  breakwaters,  revetments  and artificial reefs are increasingly being developed. Softer and low cost protection alternatives, such as structures made of geotextile sand containers (GSC) are often used instead of more expensive and hard coastal structures made of concrete or rubble material.                                                       Although the effect of the deformations of the sand containers on the hydraulic stability is significant,  no  stability  formula  is  available  to  account  for  those  deformations  and  the associated processes leading to the observed failures. Therefore, the primary objective of the thesis  is  the  hydraulic  stability  of  coastal  GSC-structures,  taking  into  account  the  effect  of those deformations and associated processes.  To achieve a better understanding of the processes that affect the stability of GSC-structures several  types  of  hydraulic  model  experiments  and  analyses  were  performed.  Among  the processes  investigated,  the  following  are  worth  mentioning:  (i)  permeability  of  GSC-structures and its influence on the stability, (ii) wave-induced loads on the sand containers, (iii) wave induced flow on GSC-structures, (iv) internal movement of sand in the containers and its effect on the stability, (v) variation of contact areas among neighbouring GSCs during wave action, (vi) types of displacement of GSCs within a coastal structure and finally (vii) the effect of the deformations on the stability of GSC-structures.  In  addition,  a  flow  model  and  two  structural  dynamic  models  were  further  developed, validated  and  applied  to  extend  the  range  of  the  hydraulic  model  tests  towards  a  better understanding of the processes involved in the wave structure interaction. The wave-induced forces on the GSCs are calculated by using a RANS-VOF type model, initially developed at Cornell University, USA. The stresses and deformations for each sand container are simulated by  using  a  finite  element  model  (FEM)  and  finally,  the  displacement  of  containers  is simulated by a discrete element model (DEM).   Based on the experimental and numerical results, analytical stability formulae that account for the deformation of the individual GSCs for each type of observed displacement are developed and  the  required  drag,  inertia  and  lift  coefficients  are  determined  experimentally.  Stability formulae  for  each  type  of  coastal  structures  made  of  geotextile  sand  containers  such  as breakwaters, revetments, dune reinforcement and scour protection systems are proposed.   Moreover,  recommendations  for  the  application  of  the  stability  formulae  and  for  the construction of GSC-structures are outlined.  Based on the results of several experimental, numerical and theoretical studies performed in this thesis, a much better understanding of the hydro-geotechnical processes which affect the stability  of  the  coastal  GSC-structures  has  been  achieved.  Moreover,  reliable  stability formulae for GSC-structures which account for the deformation effect of the GSCs have been derived.', 'Ein Konzept, die Dünenerosion und somit deren Funktionsverlust zu verhindern, stellt die Dünenverstärkung durch Geotextilien dar.

Haupthindernis für den verstärkten Einsatz geotextiler Sandcontainer (GSC) bildet dabei das Fehlen zuverlässiger Bemessungsgrundlagen, die die Verformung der Sandcontainer und die hydraulischen Prozesse, welche die Stabilität beeinflussen, berücksichtigen.

Essays on real estate and financial crisis : from the US housing market downturn to the global financial crisis,"The thesis studies three pivotal episodes in the evolution of what became the Global Financial Crisis of 2008-09. These three events - the collapse of the US housing market, the breakdown of the repo money market, and the banking crash - are indispensable for understanding some of the key economic forces that supposedly lay behind the escalation of the Global Financial Crisis. They tell a story of what went wrong and why. For instance, had mortgage contracts not been ill-designed in the sense that they facilitated deliberate defaults, the drag on the wider US housing market would have been less dramatic. Had large financial institutions not relied that heavily on short-term funding backed by US housing collateral, they might have been able to sufficiently roll over their obligations. Had the hoarding of liquid securities by prime brokers not harmed financial intermediation, the secured funding market might not have squeezed. Consequently, the investment bank Lehman Brothers would have possibly been intact today. No financial contagion would have been released. But unfortunately, all of these events did occur.

Einerseits hat die EU bestehende Sanktionsregime der Vereinten Nationen stellvertretend für alle Mitgliedsstaaten unionsrechtlich umgesetzt, andererseits hat sie zunehmend auch autonome Sanktionsregime, insbesondere gegen kriminelle Eliten, geschaffen. -- Die Arbeit von Eva Lotte Stöckel bietet eine umfassende Darstellung sämtlicher von der EU erlassenen smart sanctions, die zahlreiche Fragen in Bezug auf ihre Transparenz, Rechtmäßigkeit und Effektivität aufwerfen. Dabei beschäftigt sich die Autorin insbesondere mit dem Entstehen neuer grundrechtlicher Gefährdungslagen im Spannungsverhältnis von Freiheit und Sicherheit. Ein besonderes Augenmerk widmet sie dem Grundrechtsschutz im Mehrebenensystem des Europa- und Völkerrechts. / For some time now, the United Nations has not only adopted traditional economic sanctions regimes under Article 41 (2) of the UN-Charter against states in order to implement International law but has also made increasing use of so-called »smart« or »targeted« sanctions against individuals and organizations. These measures regularly involve the freezing of assets belonging to listed individuals and entities and the making of orders to prevent new funds becoming available by cutting off their financial resources. Following the September 11th attacks and the global fight against terrorism, these smart sanctions have also found their way into the law of the European Union (EU). On the one hand, the EU has adopted the UN sanctions regimes and transformed them into EU law. On the other hand, the EU has adopted a number of autonomous smart sanctions regimes which are targeted against criminal elites in third states. -- This study seeks to outline and answer the main issues raised in the context of smart sanctions following the current developments in EU policy and taking account of the judgments of the European courts. A special focus of this work is the international debate on whether legal safeguards, including human rights standards, apply or should apply to smart sanctions regimes where International law and EU law overlap.",gnd:4022344-9 gnd:4112701-8 gnd:4059534-1 gnd:4137830-1
Angle Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy of Delafossite Metals,"['This thesis describes the results of angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments on delafossite oxide metals, and theoretical work explaining these observations. The study was motivated by the extraordinarily high conductivity of the non-magnetic delafossites PdCoO2 and PtCoO2, the measurement of whose electronic structure is reported and discussed. Two unexpected effects were observed in the course of the investigation; each is described and analysed in detail. Firstly, a previously unrecognised type of spectroscopic signal, allowing the non-magnetic probe of photoemission to become sensitive to spin-spin correlations, was observed in the antiferromagnetic PdCrO2. Its origin was identified as the Kondo-like coupling of itinerant and Mott insulating electrons. Furthermore, surface states exhibiting an unusually large Rashba-like spin-splitting were observed on the transition metal terminated surfaces of delafossites. The large inversion symmetry breaking energy scale, a consequence of the unusual structure of the surface layer, is identified as the origin of the effect', 'Introduction -- Angle Resolved Photoemission -- Theory and Models -- Bulk States in PtCoO2 and PdCoO2 -- Coupling of Metallic and Mott-insulating states in PdCrO2 -- Rashba-like Spin-Split Surface States -- Conclusions and Outlook -- Appendices']",gnd:4182337-0 gnd:4337039-1 gnd:4318015-2 gnd:4255726-4 gnd:4134881-3 gnd:4061385-9 gnd:1037387953 gnd:4142666-6

Charge carrier recombination and open circuit voltage in organic solar cells : from bilayer-model systems to hybrid multi-junctions,"Tremendous progress in the development of thin film solar cell techniques has been made over the last decade. The field of organic solar cells is constantly developing, new material classes like Perowskite solar cells are emerging and different types of hybrid organic/inorganic material combinations are being investigated for their physical properties and their applicability in thin film electronics. Besides typical single-junction architectures for solar cells, multi-junction concepts are also being investigated as they enable the overcoming of theoretical limitations of a single-junction. In multi-junction devices each sub-cell operates in different wavelength regimes and should exhibit optimized band-gap energies. It is exactly this tunability of the band-gap energy that renders organic solar cell materials interesting candidates for multi-junction applications. Nevertheless, only few attempts have been made to combine inorganic and organic solar cells in series connected multi-junction architectures.

For the less exotic and more abundantly produced isotopes 51Ca and 52Ca the Penning trap based ToF-ICR technique could be used to validate the available mass data and to improve their precision. For the isotopes 53Ca and 54Ca, a Multi-Reflection Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer (MR-ToF MS) was used to determine the mass of these exotic isotopes for the first time experimentally. This also represents the first time an MR-ToF MS was applied to derive the masses of previously unknown radioactive ions from the high precision time-of-flight data that can be gathered with the device. The mass data was then used to benchmark the strength of the N=32 neutron subshell closure and at the same time to compare to state-of-the-art shell-model calculations. Furthermore, the capability of the MR-ToF device to deliver isobarically pure beams to a subsequent experiment was developed further and studied in detail. The new technique is based on the in-trap lift, which is normally used to in- and eject ions into and from the device. With this new selective ejection technique after separation of the ion ensemble in the MR-ToF trap, no external components are required.

"Symbolic regression for identification, prediction, and control of dynamical systems","In the present work, we use symbolic regression for automated modeling of dynamical systems. Symbolic regression is a powerful and general method suitable for data-driven identification of mathematical expressions. In particular, the structure and parameters of those expressions are identified simultaneously. We consider two main variants of symbolic regression: sparse regression-based and genetic programming-based symbolic regression. Both are applied to identification, prediction and control of dynamical systems. We introduce a new methodology for the data-driven identification of nonlinear dynamics for systems undergoing abrupt changes. Building on a sparse regression algorithm derived earlier, the model after the change is defined as a minimum update with respect to a reference model of the system identified prior to the change. The technique is successfully exemplified on the chaotic Lorenz system and the van der Pol oscillator.

Advancing the characterization of neuronal cyto-architecture by x-ray phase-contrast tomography,"To bring physiology and pathology of the human brain into better micro-anatomical and histological context, studies with different methodologies are required. Established techniques such as electron microscopy or histology show limitations in view of invasiveness, labor-intense and artifact-prone sample preparation, as well as an adequate ratio between resolution and volume throughput. For this reason, X-ray phase-contrast tomography (PC-CT) has been proposed as a three-dimensional non-destructive imaging technique, which requires less effort in sample preparation and can assess larger volumes. Furthermore, it offers quantitative electron density based contrast even for unstained tissue. Up to now, however, PC-CT studies fell short in number of samples, so that structural alterations caused by neurodegenerative diseases cannot be distinguished from physiological inter-subject variations. In this thesis, the scalability of PC-CT with respect to the required number of samples and resolution-to-volume-throughput is demonstrated, and the methodology is advanced with respect to data acquisition, processing and segmentation. In addition to the human cerebellum, cortex and hippocampus are studied. Concerning quantification and analysis of PC-CT data, this work introduces optimal transport analysis to obtain quantitative metrics of the cyto-architecture and to identify changes due to neurodegenerative diseases. For the case of Alzheimer’s disease, this workflow reveals a yet undescribed compactification of granular cells in the human hippocampus. This thesis also provides optimized configurations to study neural tissues with laboratory instrumentation, and – finally – provides new correlative imaging approaches, in particular with scanning electron microscopy.",gnd:4159947-0 gnd:4113240-3 gnd:4475269-6 gnd:4174161-4

Investigations of Field Dynamics in Laser Plasmas with Proton Imaging,"Laser-driven proton beams are still in their infancy but already have some outstanding attributes compared to those produced in conventional accelerators. One such attribute is the typically low beam emittance. This allows excellent resolution in imaging applications like proton radiography. This thesis describes a novel imaging technique - the proton streak camera - that the author developed and first used to measure both the spatial and temporal evolution of ultra-strong electrical fields in laser-driven plasmas. Such investigations are of paramount importance for the understanding of laser-plasma interactions and, thus, for optimization of laser-driven particle acceleration. In particular, the present work investigated micrometer-sized spherical targets after laser irradiation. The confined geometry of plasmas and fields was found to influence the kinetic energy and spatial distribution of accelerated ions.

Convex integration applied to the multi-dimensional compressible Euler equations,"This book applies the convex integration method to multi-dimensional compressible Euler equations in the barotropic case as well as the full system with temperature. The convex integration technique, originally developed in the context of differential inclusions, was applied in the groundbreaking work of De Lellis and Székelyhidi to the incompressible Euler equations, leading to infinitely many solutions. This theory was later refined to prove non-uniqueness of solutions of the compressible Euler system, too. These non-uniqueness results all use an ansatz which reduces the equations to a kind of incompressible system to which a slight modification of the incompressible theory can be applied. This book presents, for the first time, a generalization of the De Lellis–Székelyhidi approach to the setting of compressible Euler equations. The structure of this book is as follows: after providing an accessible introduction to the subject, including the essentials of hyperbolic conservation laws, the idea of convex integration in the compressible framework is developed. The main result proves that under a certain assumption there exist infinitely many solutions to an abstract initial boundary value problem for the Euler system. Next some applications of this theorem are discussed, in particular concerning the Riemann problem. Finally there is a survey of some related results. This self-contained book is suitable for both beginners in the field of hyperbolic conservation laws as well as for advanced readers who already know about convex integration in the incompressible framework.",gnd:4019339-1 gnd:4219070-8

Extending the x-ray study of membrane fusion in supported multibilayers towards physiological conditions,"Previously, our group successfully characterized the effect of various lipids on the stalk formation in pure lipid multibilayers by means of x-ray scattering. In this model system, the energy required for stalk formation was supplied by the osmotic pressure of the aqueous vapor. Despite its remarkable simplicity and efﬁ ciency, the sample environment of this method was distinct from the fusion sites in vivo. This work aims to extend the x-ray study of stalk formation to more physiological conditions. To this end, efforts on three levels have been devoted, namely the lipid level, the peptide level and the protein level. On the lipid level, PEG solutions rather than aqueous vapor were used as the stressor to promote stalk formation in pure lipid bilayers. On the peptide level, D-β-peptides were incorporated into model lipid multibilayers to investigate its transmembrane behaviors. Lastly, on the protein level, a novel solvent-free protocol was developed, and SNAREs, a family of proteins which mediate vesicle fuion, were reconstituted into the multibilayers via the micelle-vesicle-multibilayer pathway.",gnd:4210049-5 gnd:4076388-2 gnd:4050331-8 gnd:4035873-2 gnd:4045125-2 gnd:4150451-3

Process development for production of aerogels with controlled morphology as potential drug carrier systems,"['Aerogels are nanoporous materials with extremely low bulk density and high specific surface area.

Constructing quantum spacetime: Relation to classical gravity,"Despite remarkable progress made in the past century, which has revolutionized our understanding of the universe, there are numerous open questions left in theoretical physics. Particularly important is the fact that the theories describing the fundamental interactions of nature are incompatible. Einstein's theory of general relative describes gravity as a dynamical spacetime, which is curved by matter and whose curvature determines the motion of matter. On the other hand we have quantum field theory, in form of the standard model of particle physics, where particles interact via the remaining interactions - electromagnetic, weak and strong interaction - on a flat, static spacetime without gravity. A theory of quantum gravity is hoped to cure this incompatibility by heuristically replacing classical spacetime by quantum spacetime'. Several approaches exist attempting to define such a theory with differing underlying premises and ideas, where it is not clear which is to be preferred. Yet a minimal requirement is the compatibility with the classical theory, they attempt to generalize. Interestingly many of these models rely on discrete structures in their definition or postulate discreteness of spacetime to be fundamental. Besides the direct advantages discretisations provide, e.g. permitting numerical simulations, they come with serious caveats requiring thorough investigation: In general discretisations break fundamental diffeomorphism symmetry of gravity and are generically not unique. Both complicates establishing the connection to the classical continuum theory. The main focus of this thesis lies in the investigation of this relation for spin foam models. This is done on different levels of the discretisation / triangulation, ranging from few simplices up to the continuum limit. In the regime of very few simplices we confirm and deepen the connection of spin foam models to discrete gravity. Moreover, we discuss dynamical, e.g. diffeomorphism invariance in the discrete, to fix the ambiguities of the models. In order to satisfy these conditions, the discrete models have to be improved in a renormalisation procedure, which also allows us to study their continuum dynamics. Applied to simplified spin foam models, we uncover a rich, non--trivial fixed point structure, which we summarize in a phase diagram. Inspired by these methods, we propose a method to consistently construct the continuum theory, which comes with a unique vacuum state",gnd:1103240579
Computational methods for the analysis of mass spectrometry imaging data,"A powerful enhancement to MS-based detection is the addition of spatial information to the chemical data; an approach called mass spectrometry imaging (MSI). MSI enables two- and three-dimensional overviews of hundreds of molecular species over a wide mass range in complex biological samples. In this work, we present two computational methods and a workflow that address three different aspects of MSI data analysis: correction of mass shifts, unsupervised exploration of the data and importance of preprocessing and chemometrics to extract meaningful information from the data. We introduce a new lock mass-free recalibration procedure that enables to significantly reduce these mass shift effects in MSI data. Our method exploits similarities amongst peaklist pairs and takes advantage of the spatial context in three different ways, to perform mass correction in an iterative manner. As an extension of this work, we also present a Java-based tool, MSICorrect, that implements our recalibration approach and also allows data visualization. In the next part, an unsupervised approach to rank ion intensity maps based on the abundance of their spatial pattern is presented. Our method provides a score to every ion intensity map based on the abundance of spatial pattern present in it and then ranks all the maps using it. To know which masses exhibit similar spatial distribution, our method uses spatial-similarity based grouping to provide lists of masses that exhibit similar distribution patterns. In the last part, we demonstrate the application of a data preprocessing and multivariate analysis pipeline to a real-world biological dataset. We demonstrate this by applying the full pipeline to a high-resolution MSI dataset acquired from the leaf surface of Black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa). Application of the pipeline helped in highlighting and visualizing the chemical specificity on the leaf surface.",gnd:4123037-1 gnd:4006684-8 gnd:4037882-2
Phytodiversity in short rotation coppice plantations,"Woody biomass plantations are considered the most crucial source of biomass used for energy production. An increasing demand for wood from Short Rotation Coppice (SRC) plantations is predicted for the nearer future and could result in major land-use changes. As agriculture plays a major role in the global loss of biodiversity, it is of great importance to analyse possible impacts of SRC plantations on the environment. Analyses on phytodiversity of 15 willow (Salix spp.) and poplar (Populus spp.) SRC plantations in Central Sweden and Northern Germany were conducted on field level (chap. 3), local landscape-scale (chap. 4) and higher landscape-scale (chap. 5). The main objectives were (i) to identify factors influencing phytodiversity within willow and poplar SRC plantations and (ii) to investigate the contribution of SRC plantations to phytodiversity in agricultural landscapes. Chap. 2 gives an overview of the current state of knowledge on phytodiversity in SRC plantations and presents derived management recommendations. Although SRC plantations can have clear benefits for biodiversity, negative effects are also possible. The location of SRC establishment should be considered carefully. Areas with nature conservation status should be avoided whereas areas dominated by agriculture are suitable. A proper management, e.g. creating structural diversity by planting several smaller instead of a large SRC plantation, planting different crops at one site and harvest in different rotation regimes are beneficial for phytodiversity ...",gnd:7748332-7 gnd:4507769-1

Die Untersuchungen zum FE zeigen, dass Cluster, die sich unter Hochfluss-Bestrahlung bilden, kleiner sind und tendenziell eine höhere Anzahldichte haben als unter Niedrigfluss-Bestrahlungen und gleicher Fluenz. Dies lässt sich mit einem Modell, welches bestrahlungsbeschleunigte Diffusion mit deterministischem Wachstum kombiniert, erklären. Die SANS-Ergebnisse zum LBE zeigen, dass das Auftreten dieses Effekts von den Bestrahlungsbedingungen abhängt. Die APT-Untersuchungen deuten darauf hin, dass Cu-freie Cluster ursächlich für das Auftreten eines LBEs sind. Ein mechanistisches Zwei-Pfad-Modell erläutert dieses Resultat.']",gnd:4041980-0 gnd:4397332-2 gnd:4074631-8 gnd:4328568-5
"The sediment record of Lake Ohrid (Albania/Macedonia) : new methodological approaches, tephrostratigraphy, chronology, and inferences of past climatic and environmental changes","This thesis had two primary objectives: One objective was to explore and develop applications of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIRS) for the quantification of biogeochemical properties in lake sediment; the other objective was to assess the Lake Ohrid (Albania/Macedonia) sediment record with an emphasis on tephrostratigraphy and inferences of climatic and environmental changes using a 15 m long sediment succession (core Co1202) from the north-eastern part of the lake. Studies presented in this thesis were conducted within the scope of an envisaged deep drilling campaign at Lake Ohrid and therefore represent important preliminary studies. FTIR spectra of lacustrine sediment samples were calibrated to infer concentrations of total organic carbon (TOC), total inorganic carbon (TIC), total nitrogen (TN), and biogenic silica (BSi). To test the applicability of the FTIRS technique, site-specific FTIRS calibrations and FTIRS calibrations based on a surface sediment dataset from 94 northern Swedish lakes were constructed. Both approaches demonstrated significant correlations between FTIRS-inferred and conventionally assessed biogeochemical property concentrations, ranging between R2 = 0.79  0.99 for TOC, R2 = 0.85  0.99 for TIC, R2 = 0.62  0.84 for TN, and R2 = 0.68  0.94 for BSi ...",gnd:4180674-8

An experimental validation of Lorentz force eddy current testing,"The adoption of metallic materials in industry and building construction is of enormous importance. To make sure, that a component is without defects and will withstand the applied loads, usually a 100% check-up is performed.

The novel nondestructive material testing technique named ""Lorentz force eddy current testing"" is a contactless electromagnetic testing technique. It is capable of detecting deeply hidden defects in electrically conducting materials at high testing speeds due to the use of a direct magnetic field.

The 3D in-situ stress field and its changes in geothermal reservoirs,"Information on the contemporary in-situ stress state of the earth’s crust is essential for geotechnical applications and physics-based seismic hazard assessment. Yet, stress data records for a data point are incomplete and their availability is usually not dense enough to allow conclusive statements. This demands a thorough examination of the in-situ stress field which is achieved by 3D geomechanicalnumerical models. However, the models spatial resolution is limited and the resulting local stress state is subject to large uncertainties that confine the significance of the findings. In addition, temporal variations of the in-situ stress field are naturally or anthropogenically induced. In my thesis I address these challenges in three manuscripts that investigate (1) the current crustal stress field orientation, (2) the 3D geomechanical-numerical modelling of the in-situ stress state, and (3) the phenomenon of injection induced temporal stress tensor rotations.

Numerical Methods for the Multi-Physical Analysis of Long Span Cable-Stayed Bridges,"The main categories of wind effects on long span bridge decks are buffeting, flutter, vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) which are often critical for the safety and serviceability of the structure. With the rapid increase of bridge spans, research on controlling wind-induced vibrations of long span bridges has been a problem of great concern.The developments of vibration control theories have led to the wide use of tuned mass dampers (TMDs) which has been proven to be effective for suppressing these vibrations both analytically and experimentally. Fire incidents are also of special interest in the stability and safety of long span bridges due to significant role of the complex phenomenon through triple interaction between the deck with the incoming wind flow and the thermal boundary of the surrounding air. This work begins with analyzing the buffeting response and flutter instability of three dimensional computational structural dynamics (CSD) models of a cable stayed bridge due to strong wind excitations using ABAQUS finite element commercial software. Optimization and global sensitivity analysis are utilized to target the vertical and torsional vibrations of the segmental deck through considering three aerodynamic parameters (wind attack angle, deck streamlined length and viscous damping of the stay cables). The numerical simulations results in conjunction with the frequency analysis results emphasized the existence of these vibrations and further theoretical studies are possible with a high level of accuracy. Model validation is performed by comparing the results of lift and moment coefficients between the created CSD models and two benchmarks from the literature (flat plate theory) and flat plate by (Xavier and co-authors) which resulted in very good agreements between them. Optimum values of the parameters have been identified. Global sensitivity analysis based on Monte Carlo sampling method was utilized to formulate the surrogate models and calculate the sensitivity indices. The rational effect and the role of each parameter on the aerodynamic stability of the structure were calculated and efficient insight has been constructed for the stability of the long span bridge. 2D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models of the decks are created with the support of MATLAB codes to simulate and analyze the vortex shedding and VIV of the deck. Three aerodynamic parameters (wind speed, deck streamlined length and dynamic viscosity of the air) are dedicated to study their effects on the kinetic energy of the system and the vortices shapes and patterns. Two benchmarks from the literature (Von Karman) and (Dyrbye and Hansen) are used to validate the numerical simulations of the vortex shedding for the CFD models. A good consent between the results was detected. Latin hypercube experimental method is dedicated to generate the surrogate models for the kinetic energy of the system and the generated lift forces. Variance based sensitivity analysis is utilized to calculate the main sensitivity indices and the interaction orders for each parameter. The kinetic energy approach performed very well in revealing the rational effect and the role of each parameter in the generation of vortex shedding and predicting the early VIV and the critical wind speed. Both one-way fluid-structure interaction (one-way FSI) simulations and two-way fluid-structure interaction (two-way FSI) co-simulations for the 2D models of the deck are executed to calculate the shedding frequencies for the associated wind speeds in the lock-in region in addition to the lift and drag coefficients. Validation is executed with the results of (Simiu and Scanlan) and the results of flat plate theory compiled by (Munson and co-authors) respectively. High levels of agreements between all the results were detected. A decrease in the critical wind speed and the shedding frequencies considering (two-way FSI) was identified compared to those obtained in the (one-way FSI). The results from the (two-way FSI) approach predicted appreciable decrease in the lift and drag forces as well as prediction of earlier VIV for lower critical wind speeds and lock-in regions which exist at lower natural frequencies of the system. These conclusions help the designers to efficiently plan and consider for the design and safety of the long span bridge before and after construction. Multiple tuned mass dampers (MTMDs) system has been applied in the three dimensional CSD models of the cable stayed bridge to analyze their control efficiency in suppressing both wind -induced vertical and torsional vibrations of the deck by optimizing three design parameters (mass ratio, frequency ratio and damping ratio) for the (TMDs) supporting on actual field data and minimax optimization technique in addition to MATLAB codes and Fast Fourier Transform technique. The optimum values of each parameter were identified and validated with two benchmarks from the literature, first with (Wang and co-authors) and then with (Lin and co-authors). The validation procedure detected a good agreement between the results. Box-Behnken experimental method is dedicated to formulate the surrogate models to represent the control efficiency of the vertical and torsional vibrations. Sobol's sensitivity indices are calculated for the design parameters in addition to their interaction orders. The optimization results revealed better performance of the MTMDs in controlling both the vertical and the torsional vibrations for higher mode shapes. Furthermore, the calculated rational effect of each design parameter facilitates to increase the control efficiency of the MTMDs in conjunction with the support of the surrogate models which simplifies the process of analysis for vibration control to a great extent. A novel structural modification approach has been adopted to eliminate the early coupling between the bending and torsional mode shapes of the cable stayed bridge. Two lateral steel beams are added to the middle span of the structure. Frequency analysis is dedicated to obtain the natural frequencies of the first eight mode shapes of vibrations before and after the structural modification. Numerical simulations of wind excitations are conducted for the 3D model of the cable stayed bridge. Both vertical and torsional displacements are calculated at the mid span of the deck to analyze the bending and the torsional stiffness of the system before and after the structural modification. The results of the frequency analysis after applying lateral steel beams declared that the coupling between the vertical and torsional mode shapes of vibrations has been removed to larger natural frequencies magnitudes and higher rare critical wind speeds with a high factor of safety. Finally, thermal fluid-structure interaction (TFSI) and coupled thermal-stress analysis are utilized to identify the effects of transient and steady state heat-transfer on the VIV and fatigue of the deck due to fire incidents. Numerical simulations of TFSI models of the deck are dedicated to calculate the lift and drag forces in addition to determining the lock-in regions once using FSI models and another using TFSI models. Vorticity and thermal fields of three fire scenarios are simulated and analyzed. The benchmark of (Simiu and Scanlan) is used to validate the TFSI models, where a good agreement was manifested between the two results. Extended finite element method (XFEM) is adopted to create 3D models of the cable stayed bridge to simulate the fatigue of the deck considering three fire scenarios. The benchmark of (Choi and Shin) is used to validate the damaged models of the deck in which a good coincide was seen between them. The results revealed that the TFSI models and the coupled thermal-stress models are significant in detecting earlier vortex induced vibration and lock-in regions in addition to predicting damages and fatigue of the deck and identifying the role of wind-induced vibrations in speeding up the damage generation and the collapse of the structure in critical situations.",gnd:4056693-6 gnd:4008415-2 gnd:4053239-2

Effects of the green alga Dictyosphaeria ocellata on its surrounding bacterial community,"Marine macroalgae are widespread throughout the world’s oceans. They are important primary producers and have been used for millennia as food products for humans. The health and ecology of these organisms are greatly affected by the bacterial communities surrounding them. Because bacteria are so abundant in the oceans, as many as 2.5 x 108 bacterial cells per milliliter of seawater, it is likely that macroalgae have evolved mechanisms to regulate the composition of the bacterial community surrounding them. In fact, recent studies indicate that a certain degree of host specificity exists among bacterial communities on the surface of algae. In addition, it has been known for some time that algae produce compounds with bacteriostatic or bacteriolytic properties. However, a good understanding of the ecological roles of these compounds has yet to be established. In order to better understand the effects of macroalgae on their surrounding bacterial community, I performed a series of field and laboratory experiments using a green siphonous alga, Dictyosphaeria ocellata, as a model organism. The results presented here indicate that D. ocellata regulates the composition of the bacterial community on its surface and in the closely surrounding seawater.

Ruthenium(II) Terpyridyl complexes featuring donor and acceptor moieties,"In the last decades, tremendous research has been focused on the conversion of solar energy into chemical energy (i.e., photocatalysis). Hereby, scientists tried to mimic the fundamental processes in natural photosynthesis (i.e., light-harvesting, photoinduced charge separation, charge accumulation and multielectron catalysis), in order to prepare artificial photosynthetic devices. The thesis describes the synthesis and characterization of photoactive assemblies based on ruthenium(II) 2,2':6',2''-terpyridyl complexes that are capable of light-harvesting and photoinduced charge separation. It is shown that the remarkable customizability of terpyridine ligands in 4'-position and readily coordination to ruthenium centers enables a rapid access to highly functionalized complexes. The latter are equipped with organosulfurs as electron donors and fullerenes or polyoxometalates as electron acceptors and the donor-acceptor distance was varied by incorporation of spacer units. The systems can be considered as linear molecular triads with the complex as central light absorbing photosensitizer. Upon visible light excitation, two electron transfer processes involving the donor and acceptor units are observed and result in a long-ranged charge separated state. The lifetime of the charge separation increases with the donor-acceptor distance and is multiple times higher than the lifetime of the excited state, which reflects the effectivity of the photosensitizer. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that light-harvesting antennae systems can be obtained via linkage of iridium(III) and ruthenium(II) complexes. The dinuclear complexes feature enhanced absorptivity and in addition, the light which is absorbed by iridium complex is efficiently transferred to the ruthenium complex.",gnd:4386873-3 gnd:4266702-1

Including collisions in gyrokinetic tokamak and stellarator simulations,"[""Particle and heat transport in fusion devices often exceed the neoclassical prediction. This anomalous transport is thought to be produced by turbulence caused by microinstabilities such as ion and electron-temperature-gradient (ITG/ETG) and trapped-electron-mode (TEM) instabilities, the latter ones known for being strongly influenced by collisions. Additionally, in stellarators, the neoclassical transport can be important in the core, and therefore investigation of the effects of collisions is an important field of study. Prior to this thesis, however, no gyrokinetic simulations retaining collisions had been performed in stellarator geometry. In this work, collisional effects were added to EUTERPE, a previously collisionless gyrokinetic code which utilizes the ? f method. To simulate the collisions, a pitch-angle scattering operator was employed, and its implementation was carried out following the methods proposed in [Takizuka & Abe 1977, Vernay Master's thesis 2008]. To test this implementation, the evolution of the distribution function in a homogeneous plasma was first simulated, where Legendre polynomials constitute eigenfunctions of the collision operator. Also, the solution of the Spitzer problem was reproduced for a cylinder and a tokamak. Both these tests showed that collisions were correctly implemented and that the code is suited for more complex simulations.

Generalized Langevin equations and memory effects in non-equilibrium statistical physics,"Abstract: The dynamics of many-body complex processes is a challenge that many scientists from various fields have to face. Reducing the complexity of systems involving a large number of bodies in order to reach a simple description for observables capturing the main features of the process is a difficult task for which different approaches have been proposed over the past decades. In this thesis we introduce new tools to describe the coarse-grained dynamics of arbitrary observables in non-equilibrium processes. Following the projection operator formalisms introduced first by Mori and Zwanzig, and later on by Grabert, we first derive a non-stationary Generalized Langevin Equation that we prove to be valid in a wide spectrum of cases. This includes in particular driven processes as well as explicitly time-dependent observables. The equation exhibits a priori memory effects, controlled by a so-called non-stationary memory kernel. Because the formalism does not provide extensive information about the memory kernel in general, we introduce a set of numerical methods aimed at evaluating it from Molecular Dynamics simulation data. These procedures range from simple dimensionless estimations of the strength of the memory to the determination of the entire kernel.

Hierarchical neural networks for image interpretation,"Human performance in visual perception by far exceeds the performance of contemporary computer vision systems. While humans are able to perceive their environment almost instantly and reliably under a wide range of conditions, computer vision systems work well only under controlled conditions in limited domains. This booksets out to reproduce the robustness and speed of human perception by proposing a hierarchical neural network architecture for iterative image interpretation. The proposed architecture can be trained using unsupervised and supervised learning techniques. Applications of the proposed architecture are illustrated using small networks. Furthermore, several larger networks were trained to perform various nontrivial computer vision tasks",gnd:4193754-5 gnd:4159833-7 gnd:4226127-2 gnd:4134101-6 gnd:4264283-8 gnd:4202022-0

A flexible model for incorporating construction product data into building information models,"When considering the integration and interoperability between AEC-FM software applications and construction products' data, it is essential to investigate the state-of-the-art and conduct an extensive review in the literature of both Building Information Models and electronic product catalogues. It was found that there are many reasons and key-barriers that hinder the developed solutions from being implemented. Among the reasons that are attributed to the failure of many previous research projects to achieve this integration aim are the proprietary developments of CAD vendors, the fragmented nature of construction product data i.e. commercial and technical data, the prefabrication versus on-site production, marketing strategies and brand-naming, the referencing of a product to the data of its constituents, availability of life-cycle data in a single point in time where it is needed all over the whole life-cycle of the product itself, taxonomy problems, the inability to extract search parameters from the building information model to participate in the conduction of parametric searches. Finally and most important is keeping the product data in the building information model consistent and up-to-date. Hence, it was found that there is a great potential for construction product data to be integrated to building information models by electronic means in a dynamic and extensible manner that prevents the model from getting obsolete. The study has managed to establish a solution concept that links continually updated and extensible life-cycle product data to a software independent building information model (IFC) all over the life span of the product itself. As a result, the solution concept has managed to reach a reliable building information model that is capable of overcoming the majority of the above mentioned barriers. In the meantime, the solution is capable of referencing, retrieving, updating, and merging product data at any point in time. A distributed network application that represents all the involved parties in the construction product value chain is simulated by real software tools to demonstrate the proof of concept of this research work.",gnd:4227582-9 gnd:4144198-9 gnd:4426216-4 gnd:4156130-2
Structural characterization of Landomycin O- and C-Glycosyltransferases,"Zusammenfassung: LanGT2 is the O-glycosyltransferase (O-GT) that catalyzes the first D-olivose attachment on the polyketide aglycone with glycosidic C-O bond formation in landomcyin A biosynthesis while UrdGT2 is the C-glycosyltransferase (C-GT) that catalyzes the formation of a C-C bond between the polyketide aglycone and D-olivose in urdamycin A biosynthesis. Both proteins are classified as the GT1 family and share a significant 53% protein sequence homology. Swapping only 10 residues of O-GT LanGT2 and C-GT UrdGT2 and an additional substitution of S8 to A8 creates a mutant protein, LanGT2S8Ac, a C-GT to catalyze the C-C bond formation in vivo. Crystal structures of both O-GT LanGT2 and C-GT LanGT2S8Ac as well as TDP-carba-D-olivose or TDP-bound structures have been determined by X-ray diffraction to 1.9-2.3 Å resolution. The sugar nucleotide donor binds in the C-terminal domain of O-GT LanGT2 and C-GT LanGT2S8Ac with a similar binding mode, in which the carba-D-olivose is oriented towards the interdomain cleft. Conformational changes of highly flexible helices α8a and α8b are observed during the binding of nucleotide sugar donor and after glycosyltransfer of the D-olivose. Helices α8a and α8b are poorly defined in apo-structures and become stabilized through the recognition of the carba-Dolivose moiety of TDP-carba-D-olivose. After glycosyltransfer of the D-olivose moiety in the TDP-bound protein, helices α8a and α8b become mobile to allow the release of negatively charged thymidine diphosphate. Molecular docking of the aglycone substrate, 11-deoxylandomcyinone and tetrangulol in LanGT2 and LanGT2S8Ac illustrated that the aglycone binds in the N-terminal domain and provides a mechanistic basis for divergent Oand C-glycosylation, respectively. The docking models suggest that D137 acts as a catalytic base to abstract a proton from the C8-OH group of aglycone, where the orientation of the Oor C-nucleophile in relation to the sugar nucleotide is anticipated to distinguish O- versus Cglycosylation. These results may provide a blueprint for the rational design of novel GTs with increased substrate promiscuity and/or divergent catalytic mechanisms",gnd:4123234-3 gnd:4157751-6
Effekte von Titandioxidnanopartikeln auf den Nematoden Caenorhabditis elegans unter besonderer Berücksichtigung von UV-Strahlung,"['Engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) are increasingly used in a variety of industrial and consumer products and will inevitably enter the aquatic environment. Modelling environmental emissions of nanoscale titanium dioxide (nTiO2) resulted in predicted sediments accumulation rates up to 1.4 mg/kg*year. Potential effects of ENPs on human health and the environment are still poorly understood. In comparison to their bulk scale counterparts, nanoparticles pose a higher risk to the environment for several reasons. First, their small size (< 100 nm) enables them to penetrate organisms and cells, where they can interfere with cellular processes. Also, due to their large surface area, nanoparticles have the potential to affect bioavailability and toxicity of co-existing contaminants like heavy metals or PAHs by acting as a carrier. For TiO2-particles, photocatalytic activity increases with increasing surface area, as this property depends strongly on the accessibility of the particles surface to the environment. In order to assess the nanoscale specific effects and the potential impacts of varying environmental conditions, this study addresses the following questions: 1) Does particle size affect the toxicity of TiO2 particles? 2) How does sunlight impact the toxicity of photocatalytically active nanoparticles? 3) Does nTiO2 interact with phenanthren as a common co-contaminant in sediments? 4) How does nTiO2 impact phenanthren as co-contaminant exposed to sunlight? The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans was used to determine the chronic toxicity of two different TiO2-materials: A 21 nm, nanoscale TiO2 (P25) and a 90 to 230 nm, bulkscale TiO2 (bTiO2: NM100). While agglomerating to a comparable secondary particle size of 300 to 1500 nm, only nTiO2 inhibited reproduction of C. elegans significantly with a LOEC of 10 mg/l and an EC50 > 100 mg/l, while no effects were observed for bTiO2. Results of Microscopy and Energy Dispersive X-Ray-analysis indicate that both materials are taken up by the intestinal tract of C. elegans. Further examination of the agglomeration of TiO2-particles in the gut of C. elegans showed that both materials caused a dysfunction of the defecation process by inhibiting feeding efficiency. Exposition to simulated solar radiation increased toxicity of nTiO2 to an EC50 of 53 mg/l, while no phototoxicity has been observed for bTiO2. Since nTiO2 produces more reactive oxygen species (ROS) than bTiO2, when measured as photo-degradation of methylene blue, the observed photoactivated effects of nTiO2 are likely due to oxidative stress. To test for a corresponding genetic response, expression of sod-3 was analyzed on mRNA and enzymatic level by using real-time PCR and a sod-3:gfp transgenic strain, respectively. Independent of the applied light conditions, nTiO2 did not impact sod-3 expression, suggesting that no ROS-production occurred within C. elegans cells. Therefore it was concluded that the nano-particles did not enter the cells and the observed phototoxicity was evoked by oxidative damage at the outer apical membrane of the intestinal cells, due to modes of action such as lipid and protein peroxidation. nTiO2 was not found to have a significant effect on the toxicity or bioavailability of phenanthrene, when measured as gene expression of cyp-35C1. In combined exposure with radiation, nTiO2 appears to block the impact of UV-light on the photo-sensitive PAH and decreases photo-toxicity. The results of this study highlight the importance of primary particle size and environmental parameters on the toxicity of TiO2 materials. Even though bTiO2 and nTiO2 agglomerate to the same secondary particle size in the test system, only nano-TiO2 is toxic to C. elegans. Missing evidence for cell internal effects of the photocatalytically active nTiO2 suggests that nanoparticles act extracellular by inducing oxidative damage of the epithelial membranes in the gut. Potential enhancement of nano-TiO2 toxicity by physico-chemical parameters stresses the necessity of further investigations into their ecotoxicological effects under different environmental conditions.', 'Der vielseitige Einsatz industriell gefertigter Nanopartikel in nahezu allen Industriezweigen wird zu einem zunehmenden Eintrag der Materialien in die Umwelt führen. Modellierungen der Emission von nanoskaligem Titandioxid (nTiO2) prognostizieren einen Konzentrations-anstieg in aquatischen Sedimenten um bis zu 1,4 mg/kg jährlich, wobei das ökologische Risiko der Materialien zurzeit nicht absehbar ist. Für ein ökotoxikologisches Gefährdungspotenzial der nanoskaligen Titandioxidpartikel im Vergleich zu den Bulk-materialien (bTiO2) kommen insbesondere drei Eigenschaften in Frage: (1) Mit einem Durchmesser von < 100 nm können die Partikel potenziell in Organismen und Zellen eindringen und mit zellulären Prozessen interagieren. (2) Aufgrund ihrer stark vergrößerten Oberfläche können Wechselwirkungen mit anderen Umweltschadstoffen verstärkt werden, die deren Bioverfügbarkeit und Toxizität beeinflussen. Ergänzend zu diesen, für Nano-materialien typischen Eigenschaften zeigen TiO2-Nanopartikel (3) eine erhöhte photokata-lytische Aktivität, die durch Bildung reaktiver Sauerstoffspezies induziert wird und orga-nisches Material - wie organische Co-Kontaminanten und Zellbestandteile - verändern kann. Zur Beurteilung der nanospezifischen Effekte und der Auswirkung variierender Umwelt-bedingungen untersucht diese Studie folgende Aspekte: 1) Welchen Einfluss hat die Primärpartikelgröße auf die Toxizität von TiO2? 2) Welchen Einfluss hat UV-Strahlung auf die Toxizität der photokatalytischen TiO2-Partikel? 3) Interagiert nTiO2 mit Phenanthren als verbreitetem aquatischem Kontaminanten? 4) Wie wirken photoaktivierte nTiO2-Partikel auf die Toxizität von Phenanthren? Zur Bestimmung der chronischen Toxizität von TiO2 wurde der Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans eingesetzt. Bei vergleichbarer Agglomeratgröße von 300 bis 1500 nm hemmte nTiO2 (P25, 21 nm) die Reproduktion von C. elegans signifikant mit einem LOEC von 10 mg/l und einem EC50 > 100 mg/l, während das bTiO2 (NM100, ~160 nm) keine toxischen Effekte zeigte. Durch Mikroskopie und energie-dispersive Röntgenspektrometrie wurde gezeigt, dass beide Materialien in den intestinalen Trakt des Testorganismus aufgenommen wurden. Eine Agglomeration der ingestierten Partikel im Darmlumen störte die Defäkation der Organismen so stark, dass die Nahrungsaufnahme, simuliert durch die Aufnahme fluoreszierender Mikropartikel, signifikant gehemmt wurde. Eine Exposition der TiO2-exponierten Testorganismen gegenüber simulierter Sonnenstrah-lung erhöhte die Toxizität von nTiO2 zu einem EC50 von 53 mg/l, während die Wirkung von bTiO2 nicht beeinflusst wurde. Diese Effekte korrelierten mit der photokatalytischen Aktivität der Materialien, die durch die Photodegradation von Methylenblau nachgewiesen wurde und für nTiO2 deutlich höher lag als für bTiO2. Die photoaktivierte Bildung reaktiver Sauerstoff-spezies an der Partikeloberfläche kann in exponierten Organismen oxidativen Stress induzieren und damit die beobachtete Phototoxizität von nTiO2 hervorrufen. Da nTiO2 keine Änderung der sod-3-Expression - als Indikator für oxidativen Stress - induzierte, wird angenommen, dass die ingestierten nTiO2-Partikel ausschließliche extrazellulär über die oxidative Schädigung der Membranen der Darmepithelzellen von C. elegans wirken. nTiO2 zeigte keinen signifikanten Einfluss auf die Toxizität und die interne Verfügbarkeit von Phenanthren, die durch die Genexpressionsanalyse von cyp-35C1 durch Real-Time-PCR untersucht wurde. Unter Einwirkung simulierter Sonnenstrahlung führte die Anwesenheit des Nanomaterials jedoch zu einer Minderung der phototoxischen Wirkung von Phenanthren. Die Ergebnisse dieser Studie heben die Bedeutung der Primärpartikelgröße auf die Toxizität von TiO2-Materialien hervor: Eine chronische Schadwirkung induzierte nur das nanoskalige TiO2. Der fehlende Nachweis einer intrazellulären Wirkung des photokatalytischen Nano-materials lässt vermuten, dass sich die toxischen Effekte an der Membran des Gastro-intestinaltraktes manifestieren. Diese Schlussfolgerung ist im Einklang mit den Ergebnissen der Co-Kontamination: nTiO2 erleichterte nicht den Transport der Schadstoffe in die Zellen, blockierte jedoch vermutlich rein physikalisch eine Photosensitivierung. Die potentielle Veränderung der Toxizität von nanoskaligem TiO2 durch physikalisch-chemische Parameter bekräftigt die Notwendigkeit weiterer Untersuchungen der ökotoxikologischen Effekte unter variierenden Umweltbedingungen.']",gnd:4615580-6 gnd:4185549-8 gnd:4511937-5 gnd:4333369-2 gnd:4147127-1 gnd:4243843-3 gnd:4128872-5
Hybrid imaging spectroscopy approaches for open pit mining : applications for virtual mine face geology,"This work develops hybrid methods of imaging spectroscopy for open pit mining and examines their feasibility compared with state-of-the-art. The material distribution within a mine face differs in the small scale and within daily assigned extraction segments. These changes can be relevant to subsequent processing steps but are not always visually identifiable prior to the extraction. Misclassifications that cause false allocations of extracted material need to be minimized in order to reduce energy-intensive material re-handling. The use of imaging spectroscopy aspires to the allocation of relevant deposit-specific materials before extraction, and allows for efficient material handling after extraction. The aim of this work is the parameterization of imaging spectroscopy for pit mining applications and the development and evaluation of a workflow for a mine face, ground- based, spectral characterization.

Hybrid filters and multi-scale models,"This thesis is concerned with Data Assimilation, the process of combining model predictions with observations. So called filters are of special interest. One is inter- ested in computing the probability distribution of the state of a physical process in the future, given (possibly) imperfect measurements. This is done using Bayes’ rule. The first part focuses on hybrid filters, that bridge between the two main groups of filters: ensemble Kalman filters (EnKF) and particle filters. The first are a group of very stable and computationally cheap algorithms, but they request certain strong assumptions. Particle filters on the other hand are more generally applicable, but computationally expensive and as such not always suitable for high dimensional systems. Therefore it exists a need to combine both groups to benefit from the advantages of each. This can be achieved by splitting the likelihood function, when assimilating a new observation and treating one part of it with an EnKF and the other part with a particle filter.

STM as a Thermometer -- Chapter5. Entropy -- Chapter6. Concluding Remarks', 'This thesis presents several related advances in the field of nonequilibrium quantum thermodynamics. The central result is an ingenious proof that the local temperature and voltage measurement in a nonequilibrium system of fermions exists and is unique, placing the concept of local temperature on a rigorous mathematical footing for the first time. As an intermediate step, a proof of the positivity of the Onsager matrix of linear response theory is given -- a statement of the second law of thermodynamics that had lacked an independent proof for 85 years. A new experimental method to measure the local temperature of an electron system using purely electrical techniques is also proposed, which could enable improvements to the spatial resolution of thermometry by several orders of magnitude. Finally, a new mathematically-exact definition for the local entropy of a quantum system in a nonequilibrium steady state is derived. Several different measures of the local entropy are discussed, relating to the thermodynamics of processes that a local observer with varying degrees of information about the microstates of the system could carry out, and it is shown that they satisfy a hierarchy of inequalities. Proofs of the third law of thermodynamics for generic open quantum systems are presented, taking into account the entropic contribution due to localized states.

Purposiveness of nature in Kant's third critique,"This dissertation aims to deliver a transcendental interpretation of Immanuel Kant's Kritik der Urteilskraft, considering both its coherence with other critical works as well as the internal coherence of the work itself.

In this way the seeming manifold of themes, varying from judgements of taste through culture to teleological judgements about natural purposes, are discussed exclusively in regard of their dependence on this faculty and its transcendental principle. In contrast, in contemporary scholarship the book is often treated as a fragmented work, consisting of different independent parts, while my focus lies on the continuity comprised primarily of the activity of the power of judgement.

Stochastic optimization of fiber reinforced composites considering uncertainties,"Briefly, the two basic questions that this research is supposed to answer are: 1. Howmuch fiber is needed and how fibers should be distributed through a fiber reinforced composite (FRC) structure in order to obtain the optimal and reliable structural response? 2. How do uncertainties influence the optimization results and reliability of the structure? Giving answer to the above questions a double stage sequential optimization algorithm for finding the optimal content of short fiber reinforcements and their distribution in the composite structure, considering uncertain design parameters, is presented. In the first stage, the optimal amount of short fibers in a FRC structure with uniformly distributed fibers is conducted in the framework of a Reliability Based Design Optimization (RBDO) problem. Presented model considers material, structural and modeling uncertainties. In the second stage, the fiber distribution optimization (with the aim to further increase in structural reliability) is performed by defining a fiber distribution function through a Non-Uniform Rational BSpline (NURBS) surface. The advantages of using the NURBS surface as a fiber distribution function include: using the same data set for the optimization and analysis; high convergence rate due to the smoothness of the NURBS; mesh independency of the optimal layout; no need for any post processing technique and its non-heuristic nature. The output of stage 1 (the optimal fiber content for homogeneously distributed fibers) is considered as the input of stage 2. The output of stage 2 is the Reliability Index (b ) of the structure with the optimal fiber content and distribution. First order reliability method (in order to approximate the limit state function) as well as different material models including Rule of Mixtures, Mori-Tanaka, energy-based approach and stochastic multi-scales are implemented in different examples. The proposed combined model is able to capture the role of available uncertainties in FRC structures through a computationally efficient algorithm using all sequential, NURBS and sensitivity based techniques. The methodology is successfully implemented for interfacial shear stress optimization in sandwich beams and also for optimization of the internal cooling channels in a ceramic matrix composite. Finally, after some changes and modifications by combining Isogeometric Analysis, level set and point wise density mapping techniques, the computational framework is extended for topology optimization of piezoelectric / flexoelectric materials.",gnd:4043664-0 gnd:4017233-8 gnd:4134341-4
Vector valued Bohnenblust-Hille inequalities,"[""The Bohr-Bohnenblust-Hille theorem states that the maximal width of the strip on which a Dirichlet series converges uniformly but not absolutely equals 1/2. In fact Bohr in 1913 proved that S less or equal 1/2 asked for equality. In course of his investigation he discovered several deep connections between Dirichlet series and power series in infinitely many variables and, as a sort of by-product, he found his famous power series theorem. Bohnenblust and Hille in 1931 invented their (2m)/(m+1)-inequality in order to answer Bohr's absolute convergence problem in positive. We invent the new notion of coordinatewise multiple summing operators in Banach spaces and use it to give vector valued extensions of the multilinear and the polynomial Bohnenblust-Hille inequality.

From fundamental design to applications of supramolecular polymer bottlebrushes,"By employing supramolecular chemistry, dynamic materials of different size and shape, however mostly lacking the complexity found in nature, are accessible. Nature's ability to organize macromolecular building blocks into hierarchical 1D structures inspired chemists to employ an interplay between polymer science and non-covalent synthesis to generate various anisotropic supramolecular polymeric systems with interesting properties, such as stimuli-responsiveness and a dynamic character. One way to form 1 dimensional, supramolecular polymer structures, is to employ weak directed interactions such as hydrogen bonds. This thesis aimed to evaluate the prerequisites for the formation of supramolecular polymer bottlebrushes via the self-assembly of 1,3,5-benzene trisamides equipped with polymer chains in water. To do so, the influence of interaction strength between the self-assembly units, the hydrophobic shielding, and the hydrophilicity of the polymer exterior was evaluated. Here, the strong effect of the packing parameter could be observed, besides the need for strong directional forces as exhibited by hydrogen bonds between urea groups. Furthermore, the assembly mechanism of the resulting supramolecular polymer bottlebrushes and the possibility of employing kinetic control over the system to tune the resulting sizes were examined. Further research has been conducted on the interaction between fibers from benzene trisurea building blocks obtained by pathway-dependent self-assembly at higher concentrations. At high concentrations the systems gel due to the entanglement of the nanofibers. Since these gels are of supramolecular nature, the aggregates can be reversibly broken and thus these gels feature stress-responsiveness and self-healing abilities.

South Asian summer monsoon variability : a modelling study with the atmospheric regional climate model HIRHAM5,"The lives of more than 1/6 th of the world population is directly affected by the caprices of the South Asian summer monsoon rainfall. India receives around 78 % of the annual precipitation during the June-September months, the summer monsoon season of South Asia. But, the monsoon circulation is not consistent throughout the entire summer season. Episodes of heavy rainfall (active periods) and low rainfall (break periods) are inherent to the intraseasonal variability of the South Asian summer monsoon. Extended breaks or long-lasting dryness can result in droughts and hence trigger crop failures and in turn famines. Furthermore, India's electricity generation from renewable sources (wind and hydro-power), which is increasingly important in order to satisfy the rapidly rising demand for energy, is highly reliant on the prevailing meteorology. The major drought years 2002 and 2009 for the Indian summer monsoon during the last decades, which are results of the occurrence of multiple extended breaks, emphasise exemplary that the understand…",gnd:4170491-5 gnd:4202863-2

Twisted K-theory with coefficients in a C*-algebra and obstructions against positive scalar curvature metrics,"We introduce the notion of twisted Hilbert A-module bundles to construct a geometric realization of twisted K-theory with coefficients in a C*-algebra A.

Their corresponding Grothendieck group is isomorphic to K_0(C(M,S)), where S denotes a bundle of C*-algebras, such that its structure group reduces to PU(A) = U(A)/U(1). In case S is a bundle of matrix algebras the above description boils down to ordinary twisted K-theory, therefore K_0(C(M,S)) can be understood as twisted K-theory with coefficients in A ...",gnd:4808160-7 gnd:4361500-4 gnd:4136693-1 gnd:4033335-8
Active Plasmonic Devices : Based on Magnetoplasmonic Nanostructures,"['This thesis investigates the effect of the magnetic field on propagating surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs), or surface plasmons for short. Above all, it focuses on using the magnetic field as an external agent to modify the properties of the SPPs, and therefore achieving active devices. Surface plasmons are evanescent waves that arise at metal–dielectric interfaces. They can be strongly confined (beyond the light diffraction limit), and provide a strong enhancement of the electromagnetic field at the interface. These waves have led to the development of plasmonic circuitry, which is a key candidate as an alternative to electronic circuitry and traditional optical telecommunication devices, since it is faster than the former and less bulky than the latter. Adopting both a theoretical and an experimental point of view, the book analyzes the magnetic modulation in SPPs by means of an interferometer engraved in a multilayer combining Au and Co. In this interferometer, which acts like a modulator, the SPP magnetic modulation is studied in detail, as are the parameters that have a relevant impact on it, simple ways to enhance it, its spectral dependence, and the highly promising possibility of using this system for biosensing. The thesis ultimately arrives at the conclusion that this method can provide values of modulations similar to other active methods used in plasmonics. .', 'Motivation and Objectives -- Active Plasmonics and Magnetoplasmonics -- Magnetoplasmonic Interferometry -- Magnetic Modulation of SPP in Au/Co/Au Trilayers -- Sensing Capability of the Interferometers -- Near Field Magnetoplasmonic Interferometry -- General Conclusions.']",gnd:4149716-8 gnd:4070047-1 gnd:7618094-3 gnd:4244347-7 gnd:116732739X gnd:4172251-6 gnd:4157819-3 gnd:4174992-3 gnd:4148259-1 gnd:4140517-1

Regionally adaptable ground-motion prediction equations (GMPEs) for seismic hazard analysis,"Adjustment of empirically derived ground motion prediction equations (GMPEs), from a data- rich region/site where they have been derived to a data-poor region/site, is one of the major challenges associated with the current practice of seismic hazard analysis. Due to the fre- quent use in engineering design practices the GMPEs are often derived for response spectral ordinates (e.g., spectral acceleration) of a single degree of freedom (SDOF) oscillator. The functional forms of such GMPEs are based upon the concepts borrowed from the Fourier spectral representation of ground motion. This assumption regarding the validity of Fourier spectral concepts in the response spectral domain can lead to consequences which cannot be explained physically. In this thesis, firstly results from an investigation that explores the relationship between Fourier and response spectra, and implications of this relationship on the adjustment issues of GMPEs, are presented.

The Large Scale Structures : A Window on the Dark Components of the Universe,"Dark Energy and Dark Matter are among the greatest mysteries in modern cosmology. The present work explores in depth how large cosmic structures can help us unveil the nature of these components of the Universe. One the one hand, it focuses on a signature that Dark Energy imprints on the Cosmic Microwave Background through its impact on the time-evolution of gravitational potentials: the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (iSW) effect. Another cosmological background, the Cosmic Infrared Background, is considered for the first time in the study of the iSW effect and demonstrated to be a highly efficient and promising tracer. Changing the perspective on the problem, the use of superstructures for iSW detection is then extensively reviewed: using precise solutions to Einstein’s general relativity equations, the full iSW effect is computed, especially due to the cosmic voids predicted by the theory. Using measurements from the most recent data, it is subsequently shown how the iSW probes the solidity of the cosmological standard model. On the topic of Dark Matter, an original study is presented, showing that temperature measurements of the intergalactic medium shed light on the nature of Dark Matter particles, providing the tightest constraints on their decay properties",gnd:7589166-9 gnd:4230260-2 gnd:4165370-1
Locomotion of a bacterium with a polar bundle of flagella : insights into movement and navigation by fluorescence high speed microscopy,"Movement and navigation are essential for many organisms during some parts of their lives. This is also true for bacteria, which can move along surfaces and swim though liquid environments. They are able to sense their environment, and move towards environmental cues in a directed fashion. These abilities enable microbial lifecyles in biofilms, improved food uptake, host infection, and many more. In this thesis we study aspects of the swimming movement - or motility - of the soil bacterium (P. putida). Like most bacteria, P. putida swims by rotating its helical flagella, but their arrangement differs from the main model organism in bacterial motility research: (E. coli). P. putida is known for its intriguing motility strategy, where fast and slow episodes can occur after each other. Up until now, it was not known how these two speeds can be produced, and what advantages they might confer to this bacterium.

Hidden Order and Exotic Superconductivity in the Heavy-Fermion Compound URu2Si2,"In this thesis, the author investigates hidden-order phase transition at T0 = 17.5 K in the heavy-fermion URu2Si2. The four-fold rotational symmetry breaking in the hidden order phase, which imposes a strong constraint on the theoretical model, is observed through the magnetic torque measurement. The translationally invariant phase with broken rotational symmetry is interpreted as meaning that the hidden-order phase is an electronic “nematic” phase. The observation of such nematicity in URu2Si2 indicates a ubiquitous nature among the strongly correlated electron systems. The author also studies the superconducting state of URu2Si2 below Tc = 1.4 K, which coexists with the hidden-order phase. A peculiar vortex penetration in the superconducting state is found, which may be related to the rotational symmetry breaking in the hidden-order phase. The author also identifies a vortex lattice melting transition.

Synthesis of 1D microgel strands and their motion analysis in solution,"The fabrication of 1D nanostrands composed of stimuli responsive microgels has been shown in this work. Microgels are well known materials able to respond to various stimuli from outer environment.

In this work, it was aimed to create flexible nano-filaments which are capable of fast anisotropic contractions similar to muscle filaments. For the fabrication of such filaments or strands, nanostructured templates (PDMS wrinkles) were chosen due to a facile and low-cost fabrication and versatile tunability of their dimensions.

Fatigue analysis of microstructures,"Zusammenfassung: AbstractThe last couple of decades have witnessed a fast shift towards the miniaturization of many devices and products. These products with sizes well below their conventional counterparts are now commonly available in commercial markets. In this miniaturization trend, the semiconductor industry is on the forefront. Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology, which has its roots in conventional electronic industry; is also experiencing this shift. The on-going miniaturization of these MEMS devices on the one hand, opens new horizons for their applicability, whereas, on the other hand it raises questions and doubts on the issue of their mechanical reliability. Silicon and polysilicon, which are typical materials for the MEMS industry, due to their brittle nature commonly experience shocks and overload failures. It is until now that experimental investigations have revealed that these materials also fail due to fatigue. Furthermore, metals which are not only tough but also poses tremendous compatibility with many microfabrication techniques, i.e. electric discharge machining (EDM), electrochemical machining (ECM), laser cutting, etching, Lithographie Galvanik und Abformung (LIGA), micro-forging etc., are also used in MEMS devices. The issue of fatigue failure becomes even more serious with the use of these metallic materials as they in conventional sizes fail on much lower number of stress cycle as compare to silicon. Although immense amount of data exists related to the fatigue failure of metals in conventional sizes but they cannot be used for metallic samples with sizes in micrometres range due to the so-called “size effect” phenomena. To investigate different internal and external microstructural effects on fatigue not only new test methodologies needs to be developed but also specimens with small  sizes, i.e. mm - µm should be prepared, tested and results should be compared with its conventional counterparts.   In this research work, fatigue test setup was proposed and developed which operated on the phenomena of electromagnetic excitation technique",gnd:4824724-8 gnd:4542923-6 gnd:4074631-8
"Decadal changes in the snow regime of high mountain Asia, 1987-2016","More than a billion people rely on water from rivers sourced in High Mountain Asia (HMA), a significant portion of which is derived from snow and glacier melt. Rural communities are heavily dependent on the consistency of runoff, and are highly vulnerable to shifts in their local environment brought on by climate change. Despite this dependence, the impacts of climate change in HMA remain poorly constrained due to poor process understanding, complex terrain, and insufficiently dense in-situ measurements. HMA's glaciers contain more frozen water than any region outside of the poles. Their extensive retreat is a highly visible and much studied marker of regional and global climate change. However, in many catchments, snow and snowmelt represent a much larger fraction of the yearly water budget than glacial meltwaters. Despite their importance, climate-related changes in HMA's snow resources have not been well studied. Changes in the volume and distribution of snowpack have complex and extensive impacts on both local and global ...",gnd:4133053-5 gnd:4179852-1 gnd:4025207-3

Laser Assisted Nuclear Decay Spectroscopy : A New Method for Studying Neutron-Deficient Francium Isotopes,This work details an application of collinear resonance ionization spectroscopy for the separation of short-lived isomeric states and their subsequent study with decay spectroscopy. It reports the successful construction of a novel decay spectroscopy apparatus that can operate at pressures below 1 x 10^-9 mbar. The method is demonstrated by separating the nuclear ground and isomeric states of 204Fr and performing alpha-decay spectroscopy. An equivalent mass spectrometer would require 4.6 million times as much resolution to achieve the same result. This work unambiguously confirms the existence of a second isomeric state in 204Fr. The author also demonstrates the effectiveness of this method for laser spectroscopy and identification of hyperfine-structure components with energy tagging. This method was successfully used in 202Fr to identify ground and isomeric states. The measurement of 202Fr reported in this thesis demonstrates a factor of 100 improvement in sensitivity compared to state-of-the-art fluorescence techniques.

Improving biocatalytic reactions - immobilization via spray congealing & promising coupling reactions,"['Biocatalysts are promising alternatives to conventional chemical catalysts, because they are able to realize reactions under ambient conditions.

Phase retrieval for object and probe in the optical near-field,"Lensless, holographic X-ray microscopy is a non-invasive imaging technique that provides resolution on the nanometer scale. Therefore, a divergent, coherent and especially clean wave front impinging on the sample is needed. Yet, focusing X-rays by even the most advanced X-ray mirrors causes so called figure errors of high spatial frequency content. The results are strongly deteriorated intensity profiles that are often even more pronounced than the holographic image of the sample itself. A common strategy to compensate these figure errors is to divide the hologram by the pure intensity profile of the beam (the so called flat field). However, this division is only valid in the limiting case of an illumination focused down to a point source. In reality, as a consequence of a fi nite spot size, one has to accept a loss in resolution when performing the flat field correction. An approach different from the described straightforward procedure is necessary. Here, the simultaneous reconstruction of object and probe is proposed using holograms which were not flat field corrected before phase retrieval. To this end, a method has been developed that allows simultaneously reconstructing object and probe in amplitude and phase from holographic intensity recordings. The experimental way of proceeding was mainly inspired by well-established holographic full-field X-ray imaging techniques that require holograms defocused to different degrees. Consequently, the conclusion seems reasonable that diversity in the optical near-field arises mainly from variation of the propagation distance of light. This so called longitudinal diversity is used to properly phase the transmission function of the sample of interest. The algorithmic strategy of simultaneous phase retrieval for object and probe draws on far-field ptychography where lateral translations of the sample create diverse diffraction patterns. In view of the need for longitudinal diversity realized by shifts of the sample along the optical axis, ptychography has been generalized and adapted for the optical near-field. Hence, translations of the sample in all three dimensions of space need to be exploited to collect enough information about object and probe such that both can be reconstructed simultaneously in amplitude and phase. Concepts have been put into practice by simulations as well as by experiments with coherent visible light and hard X-rays from synchrotron sources. The presented approach offers the opportunity to perform high resolution imaging, to be extended to tomography and to be adapted to super-resolution experiments.",gnd:4025643-1 gnd:4739877-2 gnd:4178315-3

Nonlinear pseudospin dynamics of exciton-polaritons in semiconductor microcavity,"Semiconductor microcavities offer the possibility to enhance the interaction between cavity photons and elementary excitations of the semiconductor. The excitations considered here are excitons, bound states of electrons and holes. The coherent interaction between these excitons and photons leads to the formation of quasiparticles called exciton-polaritons. The respective interaction regime is termed strong coupling regime. Exciton-polaritons inherit properties from both their photonic and their electronic component. A typical property inherited from the excitons is the spin. The scope of this thesis is twofold. On the one hand, the general properties of exciton-polaritons are studied theoretically. On the other hand, the influence of the exciton spin is analyzed. Several effects and tools known from nonlinear dynamics such as pattern formation, cavity solitons, domain walls, perturbation theory, and bifurcation theory are used in order to highlight these properties. The findings of this thesis expand the knowledge about the theoretical foundations of polariton physics. This may pave the way to potential application of semiconductor microcavities as all-optical information processing and storage devices.",gnd:4174992-3

Numerical solution to the Einstein-Maxwell equations of a rotating disc of charged dust,"In this work, the numerical solution of the Einstein-Maxwell equations of a rotating disc of charged dust and the extended application of its solution results are presented. The formation of the field equations for the rotating charged fluid are discussed. The boundary conditions, which provide the disc character, are derived subsequently from the field equations. Combining the field equations and the boundary conditions yields an equation system describing a rotating disc of charged dust, which is in turn solved by the numerical approach of the pseudo-spectral method. Further discussion of the improvement on the calculation speed, such as the analytical mesh-refinement is also included. The outcome raw potential data of the equation system is processed into more straightforward and intuitive physical quantities, which can further be utilised to analyse the gyromagnetic character of the system. Furthermore, the ergosphere surface can be obtained by analysing the raw data using the bisection method. All the results are summarised in the final chapters of this work. The discussion covers the whole parameter space: from the classical limit to the black hole limit, and from the non-charged limit to the electrical counter-poised limit. A detailed discussion of the gyromagnetic factor and different methods of its acquisition are compared. The configuration of the ergosphere surface is presented, as observed from both the near-source and far-field perspectives.

Improving structured illumination microscopy by blind reconstruction and multifocus detection,"Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM) is a super-resolution microscopy method which enables a two-fold resolution enhancement with respect to classical wide-field (WF) fluorescence microscopy. In SIM, the sample is illuminated by a pattern, typically a sinusoidal grid of light. This pattern is typically the result of interference of either two or three plane waves. The wide dissemination of SIM is limited by the difficulties arising during the necessary numerical reconstruction. Artefacts are observed in the SIM reconstructed images if the illumination pattern is distorted or unknown. Blind-SIM is a deconvolution-based reconstruction approach that enables to reconstruct both the sample and the illumination pattern. Blind-SIM is able to reconstruct partially or fully unknown illumination patterns and is therefore robust to distortions. However, so far blind-SIM was not able to process data from thick samples where the visibility of the fringes is reduced by the presence of out-of-focus light. In this work, we present the thick slice blind-SIM algorithm which reconstructs a 3D stack from a 2D measurement, thus removing the out-of-focus light. The acquisition speed in 3D SIM is limited by the axial scanning and sequential focusing. Using a multifocus detection enables to simultaneously acquire a focal series. Merging SIM excitation with multifocus detection (MF-SIM) permits to enhance the volumetric acquisition speed of 3D SIM as well as removing the need for axial mechanical scanning, a source of sample drift and vibrations. The recorded MF-SIM data does not obey the same theoretical description as the conventional scanning 3D SIM data. Hence, the classical approach for 3D SIM reconstruction cannot be applied. We developed a deconvolution-based algorithm using known 3D illumination pattern that can be applied to the reconstruction of MF-SIM data. The results demonstrate enhanced resolution in all three dimensions.",gnd:4290958-2 gnd:4123037-1 gnd:4287503-1

Insights into auxin co-receptor formation and SCFTIR1-driven AUX/IAA ubiquitylation : kumulative Dissertation,"['Cullin RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligases SCFTIR1/AFB1-5 and their AUX/IAA targets perceive the phytohormone auxin. The F-box protein TIR1 binds a surface-exposed degron in AUX/IAAs promoting their ubiquitylation and rapid auxin-regulated proteasomal degradation.

Diversified intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) in AUX/IAAs position them on TIR1 allowing surface accessibility of AUX/IAA degrons. The resolved TIR1-IAA7 and TIR1-IAA12 complexes allow the identification of TIR1 residues on two opposite surfaces, essential during auxin responses in plants.

Convolutional networks to relate images,"Zusammenfassung: Within recent years, convolutional neural networks have experienced a come back and are currently dominating the field of computer vision.In contrast to previously used methods, they allow for full data-based end-to-end training without the need to manually engineer features.On the downside, huge amounts of annotated data are needed to train a network successfully.Furthermore, the architectural design of these networks and other hyperparameters are sometimes hard to choose, especially when predicting high-resolution outputs from images.In this thesis, we show how networks can be trained without manually labeled data by using surrogate tasks, strong augmentation and synthetically generated training data.We demonstrate how generic image features for classification and matching can be learned unsupervisedly by augmenting random images to form surrogate classes.We also train networks to estimate the canonical orientation of rotated images by augmenting a large set of natural unlabeled images.In the main part of this thesis, we present a new network architecture that can be used for any pixel level regression task.We prove its value by creating the first end-to-end learning approach to compute optical flow and extend it to disparity and scene flow.All of this is done by using synthetically generated training data which we rendered using a custom version of the Blender rendering suite",gnd:4226127-2 gnd:1037053141
"Odour signals relevant to beetles in deadwood habitats : odorants, olfaction and behaviour","The overall objective of this work was to evaluate and determine volatile chemical cues (infochemicals) that determine insect-wood interactions. The deadwood habitat comprises species that reproduce and spend obligatory most of their lifespan in any kind of wood and in any kind of decay stage, including fungi that depend on wood. A gas chromatograph with mass spectrometric-electroantennographic detection (GC-MS/EAD) has been introduced to define sources of volatiles and identify infochemicals, in particular host produced kairomones, but also allomones and pheromones relevant to selected beetle species of an either xylophagous, mycophagous or xylomycetophagous feeding type respectively. Complex chemical profiles of wood, deadwood and fungal samples have been analysed. Half of thirty compounds identified in the headspace of dry pine timber, the most artificial kind of deadwood, elicited responses in antennae of the Old House Borer Hylotrupes bajulus, a major pest of structural softwood. Aliphatic aldehydes, which are however not specific to the host tree species, are proposed as potential infochemicals and complement the number of terpenoid host kairomones previously known for this xylophagous species. Experiments with felled beech trunks demonstrated that volatile chemistry changes over time and that decay over the length of trunks is quite variable. Potential host kairomones, such as branched alcohols, aldehydes and phenolics have been determined for the fungus farming ambrosia beetle Trypodendron domesticum.

Theoretical and experimental investigation of the plasmonic probe,"The diffraction limit does not permit us to reveal information from dimensions smaller than roughly one-half of the wavelength. Hence, it was traditionally impossible to optically interact selectively with nanoscale features. However, with the increasing trend towards nanoscience and nanotechnology, nano-optics science emerged. A central goal of nano-optics is to extend optical techniques to length scales beyond the diffraction limit. In recent years, several new approaches have been developed to overcome this limitation. Tip-enhanced near-field microscopy techniques, such as TERS and PiFM, are among the innovations built around an AFM system. In this work, first, an algorithm for batch processing of the measured AFM data is introduced and utilized to analyze the height distribution of the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 samples. In the next chapter, plasmonic probes, as the crucial components of any near-field optical microscopy techniques, are modeled and investigated. Here, complex and realistic particle shapes are used to analyze particle-based probes’ near- and far-field behavior. It has been shown that only the frontmost particle is decisive for the near-field signal. On the other hand, the rest of nanoparticles enhance the scattering intensity. Apart from the optical responses, the mechanical properties of tips are also modeled because higher harmonics of the tip’s oscillations are the foundation of new patents such as torsional force microscopy and photo-induced force microscopy (PiFM). In the last chapter, the PiFM is introduced and employed in various applications, i.e., plasmonic probe’s quality, field mapping, and optical response of the plasmonic NPs.",gnd:1240784643 gnd:1024960048
The power of frequency hopping and information dissemination in constrained communication models,"Zusammenfassung: All over the globe there is a tendency towards using more and more small electronic devices to coordinate and support our daily lives. The standard way of communication of these autonomous units is wireless, i.e., broadcasted signals can be received by all devices within reach. Whether a receiving device can actually decode a signal by another device does, however, depends on a variety of factors other than the distance and the signal strength. Among them, environmental interference—either stemming from other sending devices or simply white noise—is the most significant one.In this thesis we investigate how such devices can work together in a distributed manner to compute basic hierarchical structures among themselves based on the restrictions imposed by constrained communication such as wireless signaling.The radio network model tries to capture above mentioned dependencies. It pessimistically assumes that signals can only be decoded if there is no interference, while in every other case signals received under collisions are indistinguishable from silence or white noise. Lots of research has been done for this model, but it is commonly assumed that only one channel for communication is available, while in reality a broad spectrum of frequencies can be exploited.The main theme of this thesis is to study multiple important ad hoc structure-building problems for the radio network model, under the assumption that a multitude of communication channels is available. It is analyzed which benefits can be reaped in such an environment, and where multichannel networks have their limitations. The main problems we study are leader election, wake-up, minimum dominating set, maximal independent set and connected dominating set. If we denote with n the size of the network and with F the number of communication channels, then for all the above mentioned problems we can show a speed-gain roughly in the order of min{F, log n} compared to prevailing single channel algorithms.While the radio network model is pessimistic in its assumptions and therefore a good model for developing robust algorithms, some desired physical properties that are actually prevalent in wireless communication are not reflected in it. However, this is the case for the signal-to-interference-and-noise-ratio model (SINR), which in return is harder to analyze. In addition, while this model has been analyzed a lot from a central perspective, the theory for distributed algorithms in th ...",gnd:4674811-8 gnd:4216130-7

Pseudo-Monotone Operator Theory for Unsteady Problems with Variable Exponents,"This book provides a comprehensive analysis of the existence of weak solutions of unsteady problems with variable exponents.

Interaction of Fe(III)-reducing bacteria with heavy metals in contaminated soils,"Iron oxides are important metal-sorbents and Fe(III)-reducing bacteria (FeRB) can directly or indirectly alter the availability of metals in soils. The sediment subjacent to a former leaching heap and the bank soil of the creek Gessenbach in a former U-mining district (Ronneburg, Germany) showed high concentrations of metals and radionuclides both in the porewater and the solid phase. In this thesis i) the impact of FeRB on metal retention and ii) the tolerance of indigenous FeRB towards metal stress were investigated. In the sediment subjacent to the former leaching heap metal retention was likely not influenced by microbial activity due to low microbial abundance and activity and carbon-limitation. In the creek soil metals were enriched in an iron-rich horizon (Btlc) and in a sulfate-rich horizon. Geochemical data indicated that Fe(III)-reduction might be an important process in Btlc but reduction rates were low suggesting an inhibition of Fe(III)-reduction in situ.

The delivery of biologicals across endosomal membranes by pH-responsive polymers,"The efficient and safe delivery of complex biological agents offers great potential for the challenges of our time. Polymers offer considerable advantages in this regard, not only because of their low risk for immunogenic reactions, their comparatively inexpensive large-scale production and their long shelf life. The biological properties of organisms, organs, tissues and cells determine the design of safe and efficient delivery systems and should be considered as inspiration for new attempts to create effective materials. In addition to the balance between hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity, the degree of charge of a nanocarrier is also critical for efficient delivery and overcoming the endosome. Cationic charges do not only enhance cellular uptake but can also mediate a crossing of the endosomal barrier due to membrane interactions. The introduction of hydrophobic or even lipophilic components can further significantly increase membrane interactions. Besides the interaction with the cell membrane, it is important to consider that both the degree of charge and the hydrophobic-hydrophilic balance also affect the packaging and protection of sensitive biological cargo such as genetic material. However, cationic charges and hydrophobic components introduce some disadvantages, as electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions may disrupt the integrity of other cellular membranes, triggering toxic effects. Fine adjustment of the degree of charge and the hydrophobic-hydrophilic balance offer the possibility of balancing the requirements for a safe, yet efficient delivery process. In the present dissertation, various polymer systems with adjustable charge density and hydrophobic-hydrophilic balance were investigated with respect to their delivery efficiencies. A particular focus was set on the key step in delivery, the endosomal release.",gnd:4296957-8 gnd:4046699-1 gnd:4140783-0 gnd:1067838503

Designing microwave sensors for glucose concentration detection in aqueous and biological solutions : towards non-invasive glucose sensing,"['This book presents a comprehensive study covering the design and application of microwave sensors for glucose concentration detection, with a special focus on glucose concentration tracking in watery and biological solutions.

Sensors whose electrical response is sensitive to the dielectric permittivity of the surrounding media should be able to perform as glucose concentration trackers. At first, this book offers an in-depth study of the dielectric permittivity of water–glucose solutions at concentrations relevant for diabetes purposes; in turn, it presents guidelines for designing suitable microwave resonators, which are then tested in both water–glucose solutions and multi-component human blood plasma solutions for their detection ability and sensitivities.

Charge Multiplicity Asymmetry Correlation Study Searching for Local Parity Violation at RHIC for STAR Collaboration,"It has been suggested that local parity violation (LPV) in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) would lead to charge separation of quarks by the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) in heavy ion collisions. Charge Multiplicity Asymmetry Correlation Study Searching for Local Parity Violation at RHIC for STAR Collaboration presents the detailed study of charge separation with respect to the event plane. Results on charge multiplicity asymmetry in Au+Au and d+Au collisions at 200 GeV by the STAR experiment are reported. It was found that the correlation results could not be explained by CME alone. Additionally, the charge separation signal as a function of the measured azimuthal angle range as well as the event-by-event anisotropy parameter are studied. These results indicate that the charge separation effect appears to be in-plane rather than out-of-plane. It is discovered that the charge separation effect is proportional to the event-by-event azimuthal anisotropy and consistent with zero in events with zero azimuthal anisotropy. These studies suggest that the charge separation effect, within the statistical error, may be a net effect of event anisotropy and correlated particle production.

Computational Hydrosystem Analysis: Applications to the Meijiang and Nankou Catchments in China,"Hydrosystems are important elements of the hydraulic cycle.

Massenspektrometrisches Verfahren zur Charakterisierung der Ölverdampfung im Brennraum von Ottomotoren,"['To reduce engine emissions caused by evaporation of oil, the investigation of this process in the combustion chamber is necessary. In order to understand the mechanisms of oil emission, the gas composition has to be monitored online for each combustion cycle. A mass spectrometer equipped with a new direct inlet-system optimised by computational fluid dynamics enables crank angle resolved monitoring with a rise time of 2.5 ms over the full speed-/torque-range of a spark-ignition engine. The allocation of the measurement data to the crank angle is calculated by a new software program based on a genetic algorithm using CO2 measurements and a model of the combustion process.', 'Die Emission von Kohlenwasserstoffen aus KFZ-Motoren ist dank der Optimierung des Verbrennungsprozesses so gering, dass jetzt der Ölemission eine größere Bedeutung zukommt. Das Schmieröl wird von den Kolbenringen als dünner Film auf die Zylinderwand aufgetragen. Die hochdynamischen Druck- und Temperaturänderungen im Zylinder bewirken, dass ein Teil des Öls verdampft und zusammen mit dem Abgas den Motor verlässt. Die Charakterisierung dieses Prozesses erfordert ein zeitlich hoch aufgelöstes Messverfahren,bei dem zwischen Öl und Kraftstoff unterschieden werden kann. Ausgehend von einem schnellen massenspektrometrischen System zur Bestimmung des Schmieröls im Abgas wird hier die Messung der Ölkonzentration direkt im Brennraum durchgeführt. Der Gastransfer durch eine Kapillare in das Vakuum des Analysators wird durch die starken Druck- und Temperaturgradienten des Verbrennungsprozesses gestört. Als Folge der unterschiedlichen Fortpflanzungsgeschwindigkeiten von Druck und Gas kann es zur Überlagerung mit Druckwellen, zur Umkehr der Strömungsrichtung und als Folge davon zur Verfälschung der zeitlichen Zuordnung der Messsignale kommen. Diese Phänomene sind mithilfe von Messungen untersucht und mit strömungsmechanischen Berechnungen des vollständigen Gaspfades simuliert worden. Als Ergebnis ist ein spezielles Einlasssystem mit vier Druckstufen und optimiertem kontinuierlichen Gastransport entwickelt worden. Die Korrektur der zeitlichen Zuordnung der Messsignale wird mit einem neu entwickelten Verfahren mithilfe eines genetischen Algorithmus auf Basis von Messdaten und einem Verbrennungsmodell durchgeführt.

Computational methods for small molecule identification,"Identification of small molecules remains a central question in analytical chemistry, in particular for natural product research, metabolomics, environmental research, and biomarker discovery. Mass spectrometry is the predominant technique for high-throughput analysis of small molecules. But it reveals only information about the mass of molecules and, by using tandem mass spectrometry, about the mass of molecular fragments. Automated interpretation of mass spectra is often limited to searching in spectral libraries, such that we can only dereplicate molecules for which we have already recorded reference mass spectra. In this thesis we present methods for answering two central questions: What is the molecular formula of the measured ion and what is its molecular structure? SIRIUS is a combinatorial optimization method for annotating a spectrum and identifying the ion's molecular formula by computing hypothetical fragmentation trees. We present a new scoring for computing fragmentation trees, transforming the combinatorial optimization into a maximum a posteriori estimator. This allows us to learn parameters and hyperparameters of the scoring directly from data. We demonstrate that the statistical model, which was fitted on a small dataset, generalises well across many different datasets and mass spectrometry instruments. In addition to tandem mass spectra, isotope pattern can be used for identifying the molecular formula of the precursor ion. We present a novel scoring for comparing isotope patterns based on maximum likelihood. We describe how to integrate the isotope pattern analysis into the fragmentation tree optimisation problem to analyse  data were fragment peaks and isotope peaks occur within the same spectrum. We demonstrate that the new scorings significantly improves on the task of molecular formula assignment. We evaluate SIRIUS on several datasets and show that it outperforms all other methods for molecular formula annotation by a large margin. We also present CSI:FingerID, a method for predicting a molecular fingerprint from a tandem mass spectrum using kernel support vector machines. The predicted fingerprint can be searched in a structure database to identify the molecular structure. CSI:FingerID is based on FingerID, that uses probability product kernels on mass spectra for this task. We describe several novel kernels for comparing fragmentation trees instead of spectra. These kernels are combined using multiple kernel learning. We present a new scoring based on posterior probabilities and extend the method to use additional molecular fingerprints. We demonstrate on several datasets that CSI:FingerID identifies more molecules than its predecessor FingerID and outperforms all other methods for this task. We analyse how each of the methodological improvements of CSI:FingerID contributes to its identification performance and make suggestions for future improvements of the method. Both methods, SIRIUS and CSI:FingerID, are available as commandline tool and as user interface.

Vergleichende Charakterisierung der Transkriptionsaktivatoren Ino2 und Ino4 der Hefen Saccharomyces cerevisiae und Candida albicans,"['In S. cerevisiae, structural genes of phospholipid biosynthesis are activated by an UAS element, designated ICRE (inositol/choline responsive element).

Opi1 acts as a negative regulator, binding to Ino2 via its repressor interaction domain (RID). SUA7 encodes the basal transcription factor TFIIB in S. cerevisiae and is recruited to promoters by interaction with Ino2. In this work strategies were investigated to purify a heterologously expressed Ino2/Ino4 heterodimer by chromatographic methods.

Development and application of 2D and 3D transient electromagnetic inverse solutions based on adjoint Green functions : a feasibility study for the spatial reconstruction of conductivity distributions by means of sensitivities,"To enhance interpretation capabilities of transient electromagnetic (TEM) methods, a multidimensional inverse solution is introduced, which allows for a explicit sensitivity calculation with reduced computational effort. The main conservation of computational load is obtained by solving Maxwell's equations directly in time domain. This is achieved by means of a high efficient Krylov-subspace technique that is particularly developed for the fast computation of EM fields in the diffusive regime. Traditional modeling procedures for Maxwell's equations yields solutions independently for every frequency or, in the time domain, at a given time through explicit time stepping. Because of this, frequency domain methods are rendered extremely time consuming for multi-frequency simulations. Likewise the stability conditions required by explicit time stepping techniques often result in highly inefficient calculations for large diffusion times and conductivity contrasts. The computation of sensitivities is carried out using the adjoint Green functions approach. For time domain applications, it is realized by convolution of the background electrical field information, originating from the primary signal, with the impulse response of the receiver acting as secondary source. In principle, the adjoint formulation may be extended allowing for a fast gradient calculation without calculating and storing the whole sensitivity matrix but just the gradient of the data residual. This technique, which is also known as migration, is widely used for seismic and, to some extend, for EM methods as well. However, the sensitivity matrix, which is not easily given by migration techniques, plays a central role in resolution analysis and would therefore be discarded ...",gnd:4768355-7
The e-invariant and transfer map,"Abstract: In this thesis, we study a refined Borel regulator from algebraic K-theory of complex numbers to topological K-theory with coefficients in C/Z, which is constructed by Karoubi, Jones and Westbury. <br><br>We investigate the homotopy properties of this regulator and its relation with the xi-invariant of flat vector bundles. We prove that their construction is equivalent to the one given by Atiyah, Patodi and Singer, and explain how this regulator generalizes the Adams e-invariant. The possible homotopy-theoretic constructions of this regulator are also discussed. In particular, we show that there is a unique infinite loop space map from algebraic K-theory of complex numbers to topological K-theory with coefficients in C/Z whose induced homomorphism between homotopy groups is the same as this regulator. The result implies an index theorem analogous to the Bismut-Lott index theorem",gnd:4141839-6 gnd:4334283-8 gnd:4120861-4 gnd:4161489-6 gnd:4012255-4

Decentralized authorization for inter-domain collaborations with iRBAC framework,"['Inter-domain collaborations are composed of a series of tasks, whose run-time environment stretches over heterogeneous systems governed by different sets of policies. Though the collaborators are willing to allow access to their services and resources from outside of their administrative domains in order to reach the common goals of collaborations, they still desire to retain control over deciding under which conditions their resources should be available and which internal information to disclose to their collaborators. For instance, personally identifiable information (PII) is one of the sensitive data collaborators wish to protect. However, more often than not PII is a prerequisite to granting access permissions when the user is from a different administrative domain. Within business-to-business (B2B) collaboration scenarios, however, information on the persons role within the collaborations is actually more relevant than the PIIs. In order to satisfy autonomous administrations of collaborators including protection of end-users PIIs, it is essential that authorization policies and mechanisms do not require exchanges of PIIs. Moreover, the administrations of the security policies are to be operated in a decentralized manner. This then opens up requirements of interoperability and scalability of an authorization solution for inter-domain collaborations in terms of policy specifications, enforcement, and administrations. This thesis proposes an authorization solution that presents not only a model that provides a logical structure of security policies but also a methodology to guide the construction process of the policies and a set of modules that allows decentralized, autonomous administration of the security policies throughout their lifetime. Together these components render an authorization solution to collaborative systems built with standard protocols. In summary, the three components are: * Model is elaborated from role-based access control (RBAC) [ANS04] with an additional indirect layer called interactive Roles (iRoles). This layer abstracts authorized end-users within collaborators local domains. By introducing the additional indirection, iRoles enable autonomous policy administration on userrole and rolepermission assignments. Equally importantly, it provides transparent linkage between local end-users in collaborators domains and functional roles in collaboration definitions. * Methodology is a step-by-step guideline that provides a process of building security policies based on this model. The end result of the process is a security policy built in terms of definitions of iRoles in the format of an eXtensible Access Control Mark-up Language (XACML) [Mos05] standardized policy, which is one of the most commonly used standards by the reference monitors. * Modules is a tool-set, also called the interactive RBAC (iRBAC), which enables decentralized operations of autonomous administration of the security policies built according to the methodology. A unique contribution of this work is its full coverage of support for the different stages of the lifecycle of the security policies for inter-domain collaborations. Though a case study has been conducted, a real-time scaled deployment is yet to be applied. Additionally, suitable methods of evaluating this work are still to be established. Nonetheless, this thesis presents the bridging elements of an authorization solution to fill the gap between the works of research communities and the needs of the real world scenarios of inter-domain collaborations not in parts but as a whole composition.', 'In Inter-Domain-Kollobarationen werden Aufgaben über Domänengrenzen hinweg bearbeitet. Obwohl die Partner bereit sind, Zugang zu Diensten und Ressourcen von außerhalb ihrer administrativen Domäne zu erlauben, wollen sie die Kontrolle darüber behalten, unter welchen Bedingungen ihre Ressourcen und internen Informationen den Partnern zur Verfügung gestellt werden. Zum Beispiel gehören Persönlich Identifizierbare Informationen (PII) zu den sensitiven Daten, welche die Partner schützen wollen. Doch oft ist PII eine Voraussetzung für die Gewährung der Zugangsberechtigungen für Benutzer aus einer anderen administrativen Domäne. Innerhalb von Business-to-Business (B2B) Kollobarations Szenarien ist Information über die Rolle der Person innerhalb der Kollobaration wichtiger als die PII. Für die autonome Verwaltungen der Partner einschließlich des Schutzes der Endnutzer PII ist es unerlässlich, dass die Autorisierungsrichtlinien und Mechanismen nicht den Austausch von PII erfordern. Außerdem ist die Verwaltung der Sicherheitsrichtlinien dezentral zu betreiben. Dies führt zu Anforderungen an die Interoperabilität und Skalierbarkeit einer Autorisationslösung für Inter-Domain Kollobarationen im Bereich der Spezifikation, Durchsetzung und Verwaltung von Sicherheitsrichtlinien. In dieser Arbeit wird eine Lösung zur Autorisation vorgeschlagen, die ein Modell, d.h. eine logische Struktur von Sicherheitsrichtlinien, eine Methodik für die Erstellung von Sicherheitsrichtlinien, und eine Reihe von Modulen, welche eine dezentrale, autonome Verwaltung der Sicherheitsrichtlinien über deren gesamte Lebensdauer ermöglichen, beinhaltet. Zusammen bilden diese Komponenten eine komplette Lösung zur Zugriffskontrolle auf der Grundlage von Standard-Protokollen. * Modell Das Modell basiert auf dem Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Modell mit einer zusätzlichen Zwischenebene, den sogenannten interactive Roles. Diese Schicht abstrahiert den autorisierten Endnutzer in den lokalen Domänen des Partners. Die Einführung von iRoles ermöglicht Sicherheitsrichtlinien autonom mittels BenutzerRolle und RolleBerechtigungszuweisungen zu verwalten. Zudem unterstützt das Framework die transparente Verknüpfung zwischen den lokalen Endbenutzern in ihren Domänen und den funktionalen Rollen in den Definitionen der Kollaborationen. * Methodik Die Methodik ist eine Schritt-für-Schritt-Anleitung, welche einen Prozess zum Aufbau von Sicherheitsrichtlinien basierend auf dem Modell bereitstellt. Das Endergebnis des Prozesses sind die Sicherheitsrichtlinien, geschrieben in der eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML). * Module Die Module führen die autonome, dezentrale Verwaltung der Sicherheitsrichtlinien aus, die nach der Methodik erzeugt wurden. Der Beitrag dieser Arbeit ist die vollständige Abdeckung der Unterstützung für die verschiedenen Phasen des Lebenszyklus der Sicherheitsrichtlinien für Inter-Domain Kollaborationen. Obwohl eine Fallstudie für die Lösung durchgeführt wurde ist, muss der Lösungsansatz noch in der Praxis umgesetzt und evaluiert werden.

Serving online requests with mobile resources,"Abstract: Resource allocation problems have a large variety of applications in different areas of computer  science and operations research. A resource allocation problem seeks to find an optimal  allocation of a given type of expensive or limited resource to a set of clients that request  the services of the given resource. Some of these problems have an online nature: The requests  sequence is not revealed at the beginning, but the requests arrive in an online fashion.  An algorithm for an online resource allocation problem must make its decision in response  to a newly arriving request in an online fashion, i.e., typically before the subsequent request  arrives. Depending on the definition of an online resource allocation problem, it might be allowed  to postpone serving a request or to change an already made decision. However in this  case, postponing a service and changing a decision come at a cost.  In this thesis, we also study online allocation problems in the distributed setting, where  in contrast to a centralized system, there is no central unit that controls everything and that  is aware of the global state of the system. In addition to the uncertainty about the request  sequence arising from the online arrivals, there is also uncertainty at each node in the network  because the node does not directly learn about requests arriving in other parts of the network.  The nodes of a distributed system therefore need to communicate in order to coordinate their  actions and one typically assumes that this communication does not come for free.  Two online problems are mainly studied in this thesis. First, we consider the distributed  queuing problem as a basic problem that coordinates mutually exclusive access to shared data  in distributed systems. We devise a randomized distributed queuing algorithm with an expected  competitive ratio of O(log n) on general network topologies. We utilize the well-known  probabilistic tree embedding of Fakcharoenphol, Rao, and Talwar [STOC 2003] that approximates  the distances of a general metric space by mapping it to a special family of tree topologies  known as hierarchically well-separated trees and often just referred to as HSTs. Our  randomized distributed queuing algorithm is obtained by running the ARROW algorithm—a  well-known distributed queuing algorithm—on top of the HST that is produced by applying  the above embedding to the distances of the underlying network. It is shown that (under some  assumptio ...",gnd:4417917-0
Designing international environmental agreements : incentive compatible strategies for cost-effective cooperation,"The international character of today's most pressing environmental problems has become a key challenge for environmental policy making. As regulation by a supranational authority is not a realistic option at present, policymakers have to rely on decentralized approaches to the management of international environmental resources. This study combines two core dimensions of international environmental policy: the traditional search for cost-effective policy instruments and the creation of incentives for voluntary cooperation among sovereign nations. The analysis offers some clear-cut policy recommendations for the design of environmental treaties and for the further development of existing international institutions to protect the global environment",gnd:4013585-8 gnd:4078523-3 gnd:4120503-0
Interaction of atoms with twisted light,"Twisted photons are particles which carry a nonzero projection of the orbital angular momentum onto their propagation direction. During the last years, the interaction between twisted photons and atoms became an active area of fundamental and applied research. In the present work, we show how the “twistedness” of Bessel and Laguerre-Gauss photons may affect a number of fundamental light-matter interaction processes in comparison with the results for standard plane-wave radiation. In particular, we perform an analysis of the photoionization of hydrogen molecular ions by twisted photons. It is shown that the oscillations in the angular and energy distributions of photoelectrons are affected by the intensity profile of twisted photons. We also investigate the excitation of atoms by these twisted photons. We demonstrate here that the orbital angular momentum of light leads to the alignment or specific magnetic sublevel population of excited atoms. Apart from these studies, we explore the elastic Rayleigh scattering of twisted photons by hydrogenlike ions. Our results indicate that the “twistedness” of incident photons may significantly influence the polarization properties of scattered light.",gnd:4046482-9 gnd:4128386-7 gnd:4189262-8 gnd:4230288-2 gnd:4177106-0 gnd:4174506-1 gnd:4045922-6
"""Eine Welt ohne Wachstum ist möglich ..."" - Die Globale Zivilgesellschaft als Vermittlerin entschleunigender Nachhaltigkeit?","['Zusammenfassung: The given BA thesis deals with the understanding of sustainability by exemplary actors of the â€œGlobal Civil Societyâ€. The current pursuit of economic growth is identified as a major cause for our excessive consumption of resources. Therefore the idea of a â€œdecelerating sustainabilityâ€ opens up ways to overcome the ecological crisis and the rising social inequality. The potential for spreading this approach lies especially in the â€œGlobal Civil Societyâ€, here understood as the â€œglobal justice movementâ€. How far the â€œGlobal Civil Societyâ€ takes this role or could play it in the future is investigated in the thesis by a study of exemplary actors\' understanding of sustainability: the International Trade Union Confederation, Via Campesina and Attac. The theoretical reference for the empirical analysis is a conceptualization of sustainability that rejects the pursuit of growth, called here â€œdecelerating sustainabilityâ€. It is based on a synthesis of approaches to post-growth, â€œdÃ©croissanceâ€, degrowth and sufficiency. The primary method for the three case studies is an exploratory document analysis to examine position papers, protest calls and texts from people in charge of the (movement) organizations. The conclusion is that the â€œGlobal Civil Societyâ€ as a whole does not advocate ""decelerating sustainability"". In particular, the International Trade Union Confederation supports the approach of ""green"" or ""sustainable growth"", which is also the position of certain members of Attac. However, other members of Attac reject clearly the pursuit of growth. A distinct criticism of industrialization that strongly questions the current aspirations for growth is expressed by Via Campesina. Therefore, ""decelerating sustainability"" is no common claim of the â€œGlobal Civil Societyâ€, but more and more an idea brought forward by its actors.  Finally, the work deals with the potential of ""decelerating sustainability"" for the protest activities by the â€œGlobal Civil Societyâ€. The idea that we have to abandon the pursuit of growth to preserve our natural resources could give the movement a new landmark for mobilization. The fact that the last climate summit protests formulated positions critical towards growth represents for the author a development in this direction', 'Zusammenfassung: Die vorliegende BA-Arbeit befasst sich mit dem Nachhaltigkeitsverständnis von exemplarischen Akteuren der „Globalen Zivilgesellschaft“. Das derzeitige Streben nach Wirtschaftswachstum wird als ein Hauptfaktor des weltweiten Überverbrauchs an Ressourcen identifiziert. Daher eröffnet die Idee einer „entschleunigenden Nachhaltigkeit“ Wege zur Überwindung von Umweltzerstörung und sozialer Ungleichheit. Potential zu deren Verbreitung liegt besonders in der „Globalen Zivilgesellschaft“, hier als die globalisierungskritische Bewegung verstanden. Inwiefern sie diese Rolle erfüllt oder in Zukunft einnehmen könnte, wird an Hand des Nachhaltigkeitsverständnisses  exemplarischer Akteure geprüft: der Internationale Gewerkschaftsbund, Via Campesina und Attac. Als theoretischer Anhaltspunkt für die empirische Untersuchung dient eine wachstumskritische Konzeptionalisierung von Nachhaltigkeit als „entschleunigende Nachhaltigkeit“. Sie basiert auf einer Synthese von Ansätzen zu Postwachstum, Décroissance, Degrowth bzw. Suffizienz. Die vorrangige Methode der drei Fallstudien ist eine explorativ geführte Dokumentenanalyse, welche auf Positionspapiere, Protestaufrufe und Texte von Verantwortlichen der einzelnen (Bewegungs-)Organisationen zurückgreift. Ergebnis der Untersuchung ist, dass innerhalb der Globalen Zivilgesellschaft keine eindeutige Tendenz zur Vermittlung „entschleunigender Nachhaltigkeit“ besteht. Insbesondere der Internationale Gewerkschaftsbund vertritt wie Teile von Attac den Ansatz eines „grünen“ oder „nachhaltigen Wachstums“. Zugleich lassen sich bei Attac starke wachstumskritische Tendenzen feststellen. Eine sehr deutliche Industrialisierungskritik, welche das aktuelle Wachstumsstreben massiv in Frage stellt, ist bei Via Campesina zu finden. „Entschleunigende Nachhaltigkeit“ ist daher keine gemeinsame Forderung der „Globalen Zivilgesellschaft“, wird aber zunehmend von ihren Akteuren vertreten. Abschließend thematisiert die Arbeit das Potential von „entschleunigender Nachhaltigkeit“ für den globalen zivilgesellschaftlichen Protest. Die Idee, sich zur Bewahrung der natürlichen Lebensgrundlagen vom Wachstumszwang zu lösen, könnte der „Globalen Zivilgesellschaft“ einen neuen Orientierungspunkt zur Mobilisierung geben.

Metastable glassy states under external perturbations : monitoring the effects of compression and shear-strain,"This thesis presents a theoretical analysis of the behavior of glasses under external perturbations, i.e. compression and shear straining. Written in a pedagogical style, it explains every facet of the problem in detail, including many crucial steps that cannot be found in the existing literature-making it particularly useful for students and as an introduction to the subject of glassy physics. In glassy systems the behavior under external compression and shear-strain is quite peculiar. Many complex phenomena are observed and grasping them fully would be a major step toward a complete theory of the glass transition. This thesis makes important advances in this direction, analyzing the behavior of glassy states in painstaking detail and reproducing it in the framework of a recently developed mean field theory for glasses that has proven extremely successful for jamming, demonstrating its predictive power in the context of metastable glassy states obtained through nonequilibrium protocols",gnd:4171730-2 gnd:4148259-1 gnd:4337622-8 gnd:4191822-8 gnd:4021142-3 gnd:4132140-6 gnd:4169654-2 gnd:4164921-7

The role of the neck linker and neck in kinesin velocity regulation,"Kinesins are microtubule-associated motor proteins that convert the chemical energy of ATP into mechanical energy to perform a wide range of intracellular motility functions. Kinesin molecules represent long-stretched structures revealing distinct globular motor domains, composed of a conserved catalytic core and a so-called mechanical element. The catalytic core contains the microtubule- and ATP-binding sites. The mechanical element, comprising the neck linker and the neck, has been known to be crucial for motility generation, in general. Human neuron-specific kinesin-1 (KIF5A) and human mitotic kinesin-5 (Eg5) are kinesins with conserved motor domains, revealing about 40% identity in amino acid sequence. In addition, there is a very high level of similarity in their crystal structures. Regardless, Eg5 moves about 25 times slower than kinesin-1. Yet, the molecular mechanisms involved in velocity regulation of kinesin motors have been unclear. The central goal of this study was to find out which structural elements of the kinesin motor domain are responsible for motility generation, in general and for velocity regulation, in particular. With this intention, C-terminally truncated KIF5A and Eg5 proteins, lacking defined structural elements of the motor domain, were expressed and comparatively analyzed to define the minimal structural organization of the catalytic core required to generate activity. Furthermore, a series of KIF5A and Eg5 chimeras with interchanged neck linker and neck sequences were constructed to determine the structural elements involved in kinesin velocity regulation.",gnd:4236029-8

Metal-related mineral assemblages as probes into protoplanetary gas-solid interactions,"Micro- to nanometer-sized metal-volatile related inclusions have been investigated by a combined SEM-FIB-TEM approach within primitive meteorites Acfer 094 and QUE 97990. Acfer 094 contains polycrystalline sulfide-oxide assemblages with concentric character that, in some cases contain relict metal within their center. It was possible to constrain the formation scenario of these assemblages to a most likely solar nebula scenario, taking place prior to Acfer 094s’ parent body accretion. A probable formation scenario could be the reaction of primitive metal condensates with nebular gases such as H2S and H2O. It was possible to detect carlsbergite (CrN) inclusions within metal in QUE 97990 as well as roaldite (Fe4N) in Acfer 094. The crystallographic orientation relationships between metal and nitride confirm a formation of nitride from the metal, which indicates that at least the observed nitrides in Acfer 094 and QUE 97990 are the products of metal-gas interactions independent of sulfide-formation. Metal (Fe/Ni,Co,Cr) – H2/H2S experiments have been performed in order to verify the conclusions drawn from the results on natural samples. The experimentally produced samples were studied by a combined SEM-FIB-TEM approach as well. The experiments were performed at several temperatures (250 °C, 350 °C, and 550 °C) under solar nebula pressure conditions (10 mbar total pressure).

Colloid mobility controlling processes in single fractures : a bottom-up approach,"Rock fractures can serve as water conducting structures for fluid flow and mass transport within the Earth’s crust. Large apertures, which enable high flow velocities, and a rock matrix with several orders of magnitude lower permeability, are accountable that those structures serve as preferential conduits for solutes and colloids. The mechanistic understanding of fundamental transport and retention processes is essential to make reliable predictions of the fate of solutes and colloids in the subsurface. This comprehensive topic is of paramount importance in many areas of geo-engineering, for example disposal of nuclear waste in deep geological formations, enhanced geothermal systems, CO2 sequestration, gas and oil industry, and contaminant transport in groundwater systems. This cumulative Ph.D. thesis deals with the investigation of the impact of flow channel geometry on solute and colloid transport through natural rough fractures.

User Interfaces for Cooperation,"['This thesis suggests cooperation as a design paradigm for human-computer interaction. The basic idea is that the synergistic co-operation of interfaces through concurrent user activities enables increased interaction fluency and expressiveness. This applies to bimanual interaction and multi-finger input, e.g., touch typing, as well as the collaboration of multiple users. Cooperative user interfaces offer more interaction flexibility and expressivity for single and multiple users. Part I of this thesis analyzes the state of the art in user interface design. It explores limitations of common approaches and reveals the crucial role of cooperative action in several established user interfaces and research prototypes. A review of related research in psychology and human-computer interaction offers insights to the cognitive, behavioral, and ergonomic foundations of cooperative user interfaces. Moreover, this thesis suggests a broad applicability of generic cooperation patterns and contributes three high-level design principles. Part II presents three experiments towards cooperative user interfaces in detail. A study on desktop-based 3D input devices, explores fundamental benefits of cooperative bimanual input and the impact of interface design on bimanual cooperative behavior. A novel interaction technique for multitouch devices is presented that follows the paradigm of cooperative user interfaces and demonstrates advantages over the status quo. Finally, this thesis introduces a fundamentally new display technology that provides up to six users with their individual perspectives of a shared 3D environment. The system creates new possibilities for the cooperative interaction of multiple users. Part III of this thesis builds on the research results described in Part II, in particular, the multi-user 3D display system.

Auf Grundlage von Forschungsergebnissen aus der Psychologie, den Bewegungswissenschaften und der Forschung zu Mensch-Maschine Schnittstellen werden kognitive und ergonomische Grundlagen kooperativer Benutzungsschnittstellen abgeleitet. Darüber hinaus werden generische Kooperationsmuster diskutiert und die Anforderungen an kooperative Benutzungsschnittstellen in drei Gestaltungsprinzipien zusammengefasst. Teil II dieser Arbeit stellt drei Forschungsarbeiten zur Entwicklung und Untersuchung kooperativer Benutzungsschnittstellen vor. In Kapitel 8 wird zweihändige Kooperation am Beispiel tischbasierter 3D Eingabegeräte untersucht. Kapitel 9 stellt eine neue Multitouch Interaktionstechnik vor, die dem Paradigma kooperativer Benutzungsschnittstellen folgt und klare Vorteile gegenüber einer etablierten Technik aufweist. Kapitel 10 präsentiert die Entwicklung und Untersuchung einer neuen 3D Projektionstechnologie, die bis zu sechs Personen individuelle Perspektiven auf eine gemeinsame virtuelle Umgebung bietet. Daraus ergeben sich völlig neue Möglichkeiten für die kooperative Interaktion mehrerer Nutzer mit dreidimensionalen Daten.

Multi-wavelength studies of protoplanetary discs,"The early evolutionary stages of a pre-main sequence star are characterised by the formation of a dense accretion disc. These discs provide the environment and material in and from which planets are expected to form. At this epoch circumstellar material is accreting onto the central star, while small dust grains in the disc interior coagulate into larger objects and gravitationally settle into the mid-plane. These are the first steps of planet formation. The study of the dust properties (e.g. grain size distribution, dissipation timescale) in protoplanetary discs is then fundamental to understand how planets form. In this thesis I present three works aimed at studying the formation, dissipation and long term evolution of protoplanetary discs, respectively. The first project investigates the properties of the young binary system Haro~6-10. I present the results of multi-wavelength high spatial resolution observations of Haro 6-10 aimed at characterising the large- and small-scale structures of the binary system ...",gnd:4057342-4 gnd:4046212-2

Determination of the methane budget of the Amazon region utilizing airborne methane observations in combination with atmospheric transport and vegetation modeling,"The Amazon basin is an important player in the global methane cycle. Objectives of this work are to establish a forward and inverse modelling framework on regional scale and to determine the methane budget in the Amazon region. Within the BARCA project (Balanço Atmosférico Regional de Carbono na Amazônia) to airborne measurement campaigns were conducted, one in November 2008 and one in May 2009. The analysis of the methane observations confirms that the Amazon basin is a strong source of methane. The majority of the emissions is found to have biogenic origin, i.e. from wetlands. A comparison of five global methane inversions shows the advantage of using satellite observations in inversion systems. The WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) Greenhouse Gas model was developed to perform high-resolution simulations of the atmospheric methane distribution in the Amazon region. The newly written code is available within the official WRF-Chem version 3.4 release. Simulations for the two months of the BARCA campaigns with two different wetland models and three different wetland maps were conducted with the WRF Greenhouse Gas model. The comparison to observations indicates that the choice of the wetland map is more important than the choice of the wetland model for a comparison to aircraft observations. Flights with a good representation of the atmospheric transport in the model show a higher correlation between observations and simulations. The two-step regional inversion scheme TM3-STILT was applied to the Amazon region for the year 2009 using observations from the 35 m high TT34 tower. The inversion shows improvements in the representation of the seasonal cycle of the methane emissions in the Amazon basin. However, the determination of the methane budget in the Amazon basin is still highly uncert",gnd:4286529-3

Improved local polynomial estimation in nonparametric time series regression,"We propose a modification of local polynomial time series fitting which improves the efficiency of the conventional method when the observation error is strongly mixing. This generalizes the work of Xiao et. al. in 2003, who considered an error process with an invertible linear representation. Here, we do not suppose a certain functional structure on the random observation error. Furthermore, we allow for heteroscedasticity. The procedure is based on a pre-whitening transformation of the data. The dependent variable as well as the unknown variance function are estimated via preliminary local polynomial regression. Establishing its asymptotic distribution, we show that the proposed estimator is more efficient than the conventional one. In a simulation study, the performance of our estimator on finite samples is investigated.",gnd:4431358-5 gnd:4228085-0
Theory of Nonlinear Propagation of High Harmonics Generated in a Gaseous Medium,"Theory of Nonlinear Propagation of High Harmonics Generated in a Gaseous Medium establishes the theoretical tools to study High-Order Harmonic Generation (HHG) by intense ultrafast infrared lasers in atoms and molecules. The macroscopic propagation of both laser and high-harmonic fields is taken into account by solving Maxwell's wave equations, while the single-atom or single-molecule response is treated with a quantitative rescattering theory by solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. This book demonstrates for the first time that observed experimental HHG spectra of atoms and molecules can be accurately reproduced theoretically when precise experimental conditions are known. The macroscopic HHG can be expressed as a product of a macroscopic wave packet and a photorecombination cross section, where the former depends on laser and experimental conditions while the latter is the property of target atoms or molecules. The factorization makes it possible to retrieve microscopically atomic or molecular structure information from the measured macroscopic HHG spectra. This book also investigates other important issues about HHG, such as contributions from multiple molecular orbitals, the minimum in the HHG spectrum, the spatial mode of laser beams, and the generation of an isolated attosecond pulse. Additionally, this book presents the photoelectron angular distribution of aligned molecules ionized by the HHG light",gnd:4343305-4 gnd:4159123-9 gnd:4140376-9 gnd:4222151-1
Interacting Boson Model from Energy Density Functionals,"This thesis describes a novel and robust way of deriving a Hamiltonian of the interacting boson model based on microscopic nuclear energy density functional theory. Based on the fact that the multi-nucleon induced surface deformation of finite nucleus can be simulated by effective boson degrees of freedom, intrinsic properties of the nucleon system, obtained from self-consistent mean-field method with a microscopic energy density functional, are mapped onto the boson analog. Thereby, the excitation spectra and the transition rates for the relevant collective states having good symmetry quantum numbers are calculated by the subsequent diagonalization of the mapped boson Hamiltonian. Because the density functional approach gives an accurate global description of nuclear bulk properties, the interacting boson model is derived for various situations of nuclear shape phenomena, including those of the exotic nuclei investigated at rare-isotope beam facilities around the world. This work provides, for the first time, crucial pieces of information about how the interacting boson model is justified and derived from nucleon degrees of freedom in a comprehensive manner",gnd:4161967-5 gnd:4299394-5 gnd:4267710-5

In-depth genomic analyses of lyssaviruses,"['Lyssaviruses, the causative agents of rabies, are a long-known threat for animals and humans. To date, terrestrial rabies still accounts for tens of thousands of human deaths annually, notwithstanding ambitious vaccination campaigns targeting susceptible dog and wildlife populations that act as reservoirs for the prototypic rabies virus. Moreover, the continuing discovery of newly emerging virus species in hitherto unconcerned chiropteran hosts and geographic regions drive the expansion of the Lyssavirus genus by unveiling its actual variety, host range and distribution.In this work, the genetic diversity of three distinct lyssaviruses, namely EBLV-1, KBLV and RABV, was elucidated by in-depth genomic analyses to provide further insight into lyssavirus evolution. The generation of full-genome sequences from primarily bat-associated Danish EBLV-1 samples significantly increased the number of available Danish EBLV-1 genome sequences while phylogenetic and phylogeographic analysis revealed a stronger phylogeographic structure for the cluster A1 of the sublineage EBLV-1a than it was postulated in previous studies. In addition, the acquisition of a nearly complete genome sequence for the Kotalahti bat lyssavirus provided the basis for the classification of this putative new lyssavirus species as a recognized member of the genus. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis revealed the affiliation of KBLV to a group of Myotis-associated lyssaviruses giving a deeper insight into the shared ...', 'Sequenzanalyse, Virologie, Zoonose, Rabies, Genom, Genetic diversity, Ion Torrent, Lyssavirus, Next-Generation Sequencing']",gnd:4128461-6 gnd:4185630-2 gnd:4156640-3 gnd:4150352-1 gnd:4276382-4 gnd:4121949-1 gnd:4264352-1

Responsibility to protect (R2P) revisited : towards climate change-related obligations of states?,"Humanitarian catastrophes as a consequence of progressive climate change are one of the greatest challenges of the 21st century. Franziska Kring underlines the important role of the international community of states in combating and mitigating climate change. In her innovative approach, the author applies the concept of Responsibility to Protect (R2P), which was originally intended to prevent human rights violations, to climate change-related humanitarian catastrophes. To this effect, she argues that state responses to such events correspond perfectly with the R2P framework. In particular, the understanding of state sovereignty as responsibility can be used as a theoretical basis for such commitments. The author concludes: Although a general obligation of states to take measures to mitigate climate change cannot be based on R2P, its application in the case of climate change-related humanitarian catastrophes is politically and morally justified.",gnd:4014573-6 gnd:4164199-1 gnd:7742862-6 gnd:4438735-0

Poly(ethylene oxide) PEO is able to form stable Langmuir films up to a surface pressure of 10 mN/m. If the polymer is spread on an aqueous subphase containing 4 M K2CO3 the corresponding Langmuir film becomes more stabilized. During the film compression the formation of crystalline PEO domains can then be observed. The shape of these domains depends strongly on the experimental conditions. Furthermore, the crystallization of poly(ε-caprolactone) and isotactic poly(methyl methacrylate) on the water surface was studied by IRRAS. The crystallinity of these polymers was verified by characteristic vibrational bands. In contrast to the models in the literature the own results indicate that the polymers are already in an organized state prior to the start of the phase transition leading to the crystalline state.', 'Langmuir films; IR reflection absorption spectroscopy; Brewster angle microscopy; Polymer crystallization; air/water interface; poly(ethylene oxide); poly(isobutylene); block copolymers; isotactic poly(methyl methacrylate); poly(ε-caprolactone)', 'In der vorliegenden Arbeit wurde das Verhalten einer Reihe von amphiphilen, synthetischen Polymeren auf der Wasseroberfläche untersucht.

Characterization of caspases from Lepidoptera and their role in apoptosis,"Multicellular organisms need a tightly controlled regulation of cell proliferation and of cell specialization together with a controlled cell death to maintain their integrity. A family of evolutionarily conserved proteases, called caspases, plays a central role in regulating apoptosis in animals. The discovery of p35, a baculovirus caspase inhibitor, has led to the characterization of the first lepidopteran caspase, Sf-Caspase-1, from Spodoptera frugiperda. Studies on the Sf-Caspase-1 mode of activation suggested that apoptosis in Lepidoptera also requires a cascade of caspase activation, as demonstrated in many other species. We identified 66 sequences encoding putative caspases, distributed among 27 species. Phylogenetic analyses showed that Lepidoptera possess at least 5 caspases, for which we propose a unified nomenclature. According to their homology to their Drosophila counterparts and their primary structure, we proposed that Lep-Caspase-1, -2 and -3 are effector caspases, whereas Lep-Caspase-5 and -6 are putative initiators. The likely function of Lep-Caspase-4 remains unclear. We found that Caspase-1 and -2 have complementary expression profiles during larval development, suggesting a differential regulation. Caspase-3 and -6 are upregulated upon immune challenge, suggesting a role in the imd pathway. Caspase-5 is upregulated during pupation and upon induction with 20-hydroxyecdysone, supporting the hypothesis of Caspase-5 playing a similar role as Dronc in developmental apoptosis in Drosophila.",gnd:4318717-1 gnd:4291096-1 gnd:4365090-9 gnd:4052831-5 gnd:4123267-7 gnd:4775956-2 gnd:4688168-2 gnd:4174592-9
Liposomes as versatile tools : adaptation of bacteriophage therapy against intracellular bacterial pathogens by liposomal vectorization and liposomal analysis of synthetic glycolipids as surface receptors$nElektronische Ressource,"Zusammenfassung: The emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria presents a severe challenge to medicine and public health. While bacteriophage therapy is a promising alternative to traditional antibiotics, the general inability of bacteriophages to penetrate eukaryotic cells limits their use against resistant bacteria causing intracellular diseases like tuberculosis. Bacterial vectors show some promise in carrying therapeutic bacteriophages into cells but also bring a number of risks like an overload of bacterial antigens or the acquisition of virulence genes from the pathogen. Here I take first steps in the development of a possible non-bacterial vector by demonstrating the effective encapsulation of the model bacteriophage λeyfp and the mycobacteriophage TM4 into liposomes. Furthermore, I show that liposome-associated bacteriophages are taken up into cultured eukaryotic cells more efficiently than free bacteriophages and co-localize with early and recycling endosomes after uptake. Also, the influence of the lipid composition of liposomes on bacteriophage uptake is analysed. Finally, in two in vitro infection models the impact of GUV-delivered lytic bacteriophages on intracellular bacterial counts of Mycobacterium bovis BCG and Listeria monocytogenes is investigated. These are important milestones in the development of an intracellular bacteriophage therapy that might be useful in the fight against multi-resistant intracellular pathogens like Mycobacterium tuberculosis.In addition, in two side projects the suitability of synthetic glycolipids as artificial surface receptors is analysed and the sensitivity of the causative agent of Johne’s disease in ruminants, Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis, to two mycobacteriophages is investigated",gnd:4122262-3 gnd:4125508-2 gnd:4157740-1

Multi-scale representations of virtual 3D city models,"Virtual 3D city and landscape models are the main subject investigated in this thesis. They digitally represent urban space and have many applications in different domains, e.g., simulation, cadastral management, and city planning. Visualization is an elementary component of these applications. Photo-realistic visualization with an increasingly high degree of detail leads to fundamental problems for comprehensible visualization. A large number of highly detailed and textured objects within a virtual 3D city model may create visual noise and overload the users with information. Objects are subject to perspective foreshortening and may be occluded or not displayed in a meaningful way, as they are too small.

On the nature of ideological beliefs systems and how they shape the perception and reduction of context-specific threats and risks,"A large body of research supports the dominant view that compared to liberals, political conservatives are generally more fearful, risk-averse, sensitive to threats; and also, much more motivated to support public policies that aim at reducing threats and dangers. The present dissertation challenges this simple, yet dominant narrative by proposing that the psychological differences and similarities between conservatives and liberals depend on the nature of the threatening stimulus and the ideology measure used to assess individual differences. Based on recommendations from stimulus sampling, the ideas developed in this dissertation demonstrate that it is necessary to assess ideological differences with a broad range of context-specific threatening stimuli and ideology measures in order to achieve deeper insights into conservatives’ and liberals’ sensitivity to threats and how they cope with them.",gnd:4050129-2 gnd:4132339-7 gnd:4026486-5 gnd:4130931-5 gnd:4064317-7

Predicting Student Performance in an Intelligent Tutoring System,"Predicting student performance (PSP) is an important task in Student Modeling where we would like to know whether the students solve the given problems (tasks) correctly, so that we can understand how the students learn, provide them early feedbacks, and help them getting better in studying. This thesis introduces several approaches, which mainly base on state-ofthe- art techniques in Recommender Systems (RS), for student modeling, especially for PSP. First, we formulate the PSP problem and show how to map this problem to rating prediction task in RS and to forecasting problem. Second, we propose using latent factor models, e.g., matrix factorization, for student modeling. These models could implicitly take into account the student and task latent factors (e.g., slip and guess) as well as student effect/bias and task effect/bias. Moreover, there is a fact that similar students may have similar performances, we suggest using k-nearest neighbors collaborative filtering to take into account the correlations between the students and the tasks. Third, in student's problem solving, each student performs several tasks, and each task requires one or many skills, while the students are also required to master the skills that they have learned. We propose to exploit such multiple relationships by using multi-relational matrix factorization approach. Fourth, as the student performance (student knowledge) cumulates and improves over time, a trend line could be observed in his/her performance. Similar to time series, for solving this problem, forecasting techniques would be reasonable choices. Furthermore, it is well-know that student (human) knowledge is diverse, thus, thought and performance of one student may differ from another one. To cope with these aspects, we propose personalized forecasting methods which use the past performances of individual student to forecast his/her own future performance. Fifth, since student knowledge changes over time, temporal/sequential information would be an important factor in PSP. We propose tensor factorization methods to model both the student/task latent factors and the sequential/temporal effects. Sixth, we open an issue for recommendation in e-learning, that is, recommending the tasks to the students. This approach can tackle existing issues in the literature since we can recommend the tasks to the students using their performance instead of their preference. Based on student performance, we can recommend suitable tasks to the students by filtering out the tasks that are too easy or too hard, or both, depending on the system goal. Furthermore, we propose using context-aware factorization approach to utilize multiple interactions between the students and the tasks. Seventh, we discover a characteristic in student performance data, namely class imbalance problem, i.e., the number of correct solutions are higher than the number of incorrect solutions, which may hinder classifiers' performance. To tackle this problem, we introduce several methods as well as introducing a new evaluation measure for learning from imbalanced data. Finally, we validate the proposed methods by many experiments. We compare them with other state-of-the-art methods and empirically show that, in most of the cases, the proposed methods can improve the prediction results. We therefore conclude that our approaches would be reasonable choices for student modeling, especially for predicting student performance. Last but not least, we raise some open issues for the future research in this area.",gnd:4511937-5
"Single-family homes in Campau/Banglatown : values of placemaking, homemaking and placekeeping in a neighborhood of artists and immigrants in 21st century Detroit","Detroit’s shrinking size has resulted in an overabundance of single-family homes in this single-family home metropolis. On the one hand, the abandoned houses have led to Detroit being declared bankrupt, while on the other hand, it has paved the way for other ways of working and living with and using houses and vacant lots that may not make an immediate profit on the real estate market and may be considered “unreal” estate (Herscher, 2012), but that keep people together as a neighborhood and community. This thesis looks at the circumstances in which residents become homeowners and how as homeowners, artists and immigrants ascribe value to single-family homes and how they make place with their homes in a neighborhood context.

Optical Absorption Spectra Calculated Using Linear-Scaling Density-Functional Theory,"The development of linear-scaling density functional theory (LS-DFT) has made ab initio calculations on systems containing thousands of atoms possible. These systems range from nanostructures to biomolecules. These methods rely on the use of localized basis sets, which are optimised for the representation of occupied Kohn-Sham states but do not guarantee an accurate representation of the unoccupied states.  This is problematic if one wishes to combine the power of LS-DFT with that of theoretical spectroscopy, which provides a direct link between simulation and experiment.  In this work a new method is presented for optimizing localized functions to accurately represent the unoccupied states, thus allowing theoretical spectroscopy of large systems. Results are presented for optical absorption spectra calculated using the ONETEP code, but the method is equally applicable to other spectroscopies and LS formulations. Other topics covered include a study of some simple one dimensional basis sets and the presentation of two methods for band structure calculation using localized basis sets, both of which have important implications for the use of localized basis sets within LS-DFT",gnd:4141130-4 gnd:4258514-4 gnd:4503687-1
Eco-physiological consequences of fluctuating light on phytoplankton,"Phytoplankton growth depends not only on the mean intensity but also on the dynamics of the light supply. The nonlinear light-dependency of growth is characterized by a small number of basic parameters: the compensation light intensity PARcompμ, where production and losses are balanced, the growth efficiency at sub-saturating light αµ, and the maximum growth rate at saturating light µmax. In surface mixed layers, phytoplankton may rapidly move between high light intensities and almost darkness. Because of the different frequency distribution of light and/or acclimation processes, the light-dependency of growth may differ between constant and fluctuating light. Very few studies measured growth under fluctuating light at a sufficient number of mean light intensities to estimate the parameters of the growth-irradiance relationship. Hence, the influence of light dynamics on µmax, αµ and PARcompμ are still largely unknown. By extension, accurate modelling predictions of phytoplankton development under fluctuating light exposure remain ...",gnd:4174642-9 gnd:4045595-6 gnd:4384013-9

Automated verification of system requirements and software specifications,"Zusammenfassung: Many small to medium-sized enterprises that specialise in electrical or communications engineering are challenged by the increasing importance of software in their – often safety-critical – products.

We are concerned with software-defined systems, i.e., systems whose behaviour is solely controlled by a program and the input the program receives from the environment. We especially focus on systems whose controlling programaccesses its hardware via memory-mapped I/O.We present a method for validating requirements between stakeholders with different levels of expertise. Based on validated requirements, we present the IRS -method that reduces the problem of deciding whether a software-defined system satisfies the requirements to the problem of whether the controlling program satisfies its specification. We show the feasibility of the IRS -method through an industrial case-study. The case-study uses a class of state-of-the-art tools for proving program correctness (deductive verifiers)",gnd:1069505412 gnd:4333722-3 gnd:4132652-0 gnd:4325372-6 gnd:4116521-4 gnd:4434799-6 gnd:4213997-1
Multi-spectrum retrieval of maps of Venus´ surface emissivity in the infrared,"The main goal of this cumulative thesis is the derivation of surface emissivity data in the infrared from radiance measurements of Venus. Since these data are diagnostic of the chemical composition and grain size of the surface material, they can help to improve knowledge of the planet’s geology. Spectrally resolved images of nightside emissions in the range 1.0-5.1 μm were recently acquired by the InfraRed Mapping channel of the Visible and InfraRed Thermal Imaging Spectrometer (VIRTIS-M-IR) aboard ESA’s Venus EXpress (VEX). Surface and deep atmospheric thermal emissions in this spectral range are strongly obscured by the extremely opaque atmosphere, but three narrow spectral windows at 1.02, 1.10, and 1.18 μm allow the sounding of the surface. Additional windows between 1.3 and 2.6 μm provide information on atmospheric parameters that is required to interpret the surface signals. Quantitative data on surface and atmosphere can be retrieved from the measured spectra by comparing them to simulated spectra. A numerical radiative transfer model is used in this work to simulate the observable radiation as a function of atmospheric, surface, and instrumental parameters. It is a line-by-line model taking into account thermal emissions by surface and atmosphere as well as absorption and multiple scattering by gases and clouds. The VIRTIS-M-IR measurements are first preprocessed to obtain an optimal data basis for the subsequent steps. In this process, a detailed detector responsivity analysis enables the optimization of the data consistency. The measurement data have a relatively low spectral information content, and different parameter vectors can describe the same measured spectrum equally well. A usual method to regularize the retrieval of the wanted parameters from a measured spectrum is to take into account a priori mean values and standard deviations of the parameters to be retrieved. This decreases the probability to obtain unreasonable parameter values. The multi-spectrum retrieval algorithm MSR is developed to additionally consider physically realistic spatial and temporal a priori correlations between retrieval parameters describing different measurements. Neglecting geologic activity, MSR also allows the retrieval of an emissivity map as a parameter vector that is common to several spectrally resolved images that cover the same surface target. Even applying MSR, it is difficult to obtain reliable emissivity maps in absolute values. A detailed retrieval error analysis based on synthetic spectra reveals that this is mainly due to interferences from parameters that cannot be derived from the spectra themselves, but that have to be set to assumed values to enable the radiative transfer simulations. The MSR retrieval of emissivity maps relative to a fixed emissivity is shown to effectively avoid most emissivity retrieval errors. Relative emissivity maps at 1.02, 1.10, and 1.18 μm are finally derived from many VIRTIS-M-IR measurements that cover a surface target at Themis Regio. They are interpreted as spatial variations relative to an assumed emissivity mean of the target. It is verified that the maps are largely independent of the choice of many interfering parameters as well as the utilized measurement data set. These are the first Venus IR emissivity data maps based on a consistent application of a full radiative transfer simulation and a retrieval algorithm that respects a priori information. The maps are sufficiently reliable for future geologic interpretations.",gnd:4497183-7

Electrical Properties of Indium Arsenide Nanowires and Their Field-Effect Transistors,"['Introduction -- Preparation, characterization and parameter extraction of InAs nanowire-based devices -- Size effect on the electrical properties of InAs nanowires -- Crystal phase- and orientation-dependent electrical properties of InAs nanowires -- Influence of growth methods on the electrical properties of InAs nanowires -- Summary', 'This book explores the impacts of important material parameters on the electrical properties of indium arsenide (InAs) nanowires, which offer a promising channel material for low-power electronic devices due to their small bandgap and high electron mobility. Smaller diameter nanowires are needed in order to scale down electronic devices and improve their performance. However, to date the properties of thin InAs nanowires and their sensitivity to various factors were not known. The book presents the first study of ultrathin InAs nanowires with diameters below 10 nm are studied, for the first time, establishing the channel in field-effect transistors (FETs) and the correlation between nanowire diameter and device performance. Moreover, it develops a novel method for directly correlating the atomic-level structure with the properties of individual nanowires and their device performance. Using this method, the electronic properties of InAs nanowires and the performance of the FETs they are used in are found to change with the crystal phases (wurtzite, zinc-blend or a mix phase), the axis direction and the growth method. These findings deepen our understanding of InAs nanowires and provide a potential way to tailor device performance by controlling the relevant parameters of the nanowires and devices']",gnd:4338599-0 gnd:4235053-0 gnd:4150649-2 gnd:4136176-3 gnd:4707308-1 gnd:4249718-8 gnd:4131472-4 gnd:4017233-8 gnd:4009846-1 gnd:4148259-1
Democratizing microscopy by introducing innovative Open-Source hard and software tools,"Science lives from the curiosity to get to the bottom of problems and from the subsequent discussion, where scientists exchange knowledge and opinions to finally come up with new questions. However, as a recent study showed, the vast majority of the experiments conducted within publications can often only be replicated partially, if at all, which contributes to the rising disbelief from society into scientific practice [1]. The high level of exclusivity of scientific experiments is often due to a lack of available instruments and knowledge of their use, as well as their high cost makes it impossible for many researchers to replicate their experiments. Particularly in high-resolution microscopy, which is an essential tool for many different scientific disciplines such as cell biology or biochemistry this is a problem to be solved if we aim for realistic interdisciplinary scientific exchange. With the ever-growing open-source optical toolbox UC2 (""You.See.Too."") [2] we show that this is not only important but also possible. With UC2, we are trying to democratize optics and microscopy in particular. To achieve this, UC2 relies on widely available components and 3D-printed parts so that it can be easily built by anyone, anywhere. Through online platforms such as GitHub [3], we enable anyone to use, replicate, and customize it for individual purposes open-source licenses. Additionally, we invite users from around the world to share their designs with the community in order to create an iterative and decentralized optimization loop. This way, completely new collaborations can be created, from the field of education to the realm of cutting-edge biology. In the ongoing Corona pandemic, we were able to show that state-of-the-art microscopic imaging can be realized even where access to such equipment is very limited, but no less urgently necessary. Also, we were able to detect and even optically resolve the SARS-CoV2 coronavirus in the high-safety biological laboratory. The open-source nature of UC2 allows connecting with other open projects to unite the expertise of scientists from around the world, together with approaching the goal of making cutting-edge tools available to all. Additionally scaling up the production of the UC2-components and organizing interdisciplinary workshops, we hope to lower the entry barriers to get creative with optics and think science easily “out of the box”.",gnd:4039238-7 gnd:1197084231 gnd:4548264-0
Surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) based detection schemes for food analysis,"The development of food industry over the last century broadened the range of available food products and increased the awareness of society regarding the importance of a healthy diet. As a direct consequence of this, norms and regulation regarding the composition of different products were formulated and are enforced. Still, different food products have a very short shelf-life (i.e. fruits and vegetable) and accordingly, their analysis should be performed in a time and price effective way, while maintaining a high standard for the quality and reliability of the analysis. The current gold standard analytical technique for most of the food products is high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) combined with different detection schemes such as UV-Vis spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy or mass spectrometry. There are, however, analytes where HPLC-based measurements encounter difficulties and research is still needed in order to overcome these.

Spectroscopic analysis of the benchmark system α Aurigae,"Binaries play an important role in observational and theoretical astrophysics. Since the mass and the chemical composition are key ingredients for stellar evolution, high-resolution spectroscopy is an important and necessary tool to derive those parameters to high confidence in binaries. This involves carefully measured orbital motion by the determination of radial velocity (RV) shifts and sophisticated techniques to derive the abundances of elements within the stellar atmosphere. A technique superior to conventional cross-correlation methods to determine RV shifts in known as spectral disentangling. Hence, a major task of this thesis was the design of a sophisticated software package for this approach. In order to investigate secondary effects, such as flux and line-profile variations, imprinting changes on the spectrum the behavior of spectral disentangling on such variability is a key to understand the derived values, to improve them, and to get information about the variability itself. ...",gnd:4150454-9 gnd:4056138-0 gnd:4190236-1 gnd:4148259-1 gnd:4277253-9 gnd:4265086-0

The composite electrode was fabricated from Kraft lignin and conductive carbon and the charge storage contribution was determined in terms of electrical double layer (EDL) and redox reactions. The important factors at play for achieving high faradaic charge storage capacity contribute to high surface area, accessibility of redox sites in lignin and their interaction with conductive additives. A thinner layer of lignin covering the high surface area of carbon facilitates the electron transfer process with a shorter pathway from the active sites of nonconductive lignin to the current collector leading to the improvement of faradaic charge storage capacity.

The influence of temperature fluctuations on dust formation in dust driven winds of asymptotic giant branch stars,"Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars show strong stellar pulsations, which originate in their extended convective envelopes. These pulsations elevate the stellar atmosphere, and generate thermodynamic conditions favourable for the condensation of dust grains out of the gas phase. The radiation pressure on the newly formed dust leads to a dust driven wind, which in turn leads to a substantial mass loss. In order to investigate the influence of temperature fluctuations on the dust formation in these objects, the dust formation was formulated as a stochastic process. This formulation leads to a set of coupled Fokker-Planck equations for the conditional expectation values of the moments of the grain size distribution function. This set of Fokker-Planck equations has been evaluated in gas box calculations. The results are compared to Monte-Carlo simulations of the same stochastic process. The gas box calculations were used to determine the values for the rms temperature deviaton s, for which the temperature fluctuations show a remarkable influence on the dust formation, and the values for the correlation time ?, for which the dust formation can be described in the micro- or macroturbulent limit case...",gnd:4203793-1 gnd:4430696-9 gnd:4244849-9
Analysis of Teukolsky equations on slowly rotating Kerr spacetimes,"In this thesis, we treat the extreme Newman-Penrose components of  both the Maxwell field (s=±1) and the linearized gravitational perturbations (or ""linearized gravity"" for short) (s=±2) in the exterior of a slowly rotating Kerr black hole. Upon different rescalings, we can obtain spin s components which satisfy the separable Teukolsky master equation (TME). For each of these spin s components defined in Kinnersley tetrad, the resulting equations by performing some first-order differential operator on it once and twice (twice only for s=±2), together with the TME, are in the form of an ""inhomogeneous spin-weighted wave equation"" (ISWWE) with different potentials and constitute a linear spin-weighted wave system. We then prove energy and integrated local energy decay (Morawetz) estimates for this type of ISWWE, and utilize them to achieve both a uniform bound of a positive definite energy and a Morawetz estimate for the regular extreme Newman-Penrose components defined in the regular Hawking-Hartle tetrad. We also present some brief discussions on mode stability for TME for the case of real frequencies. This says that in a fixed subextremal Kerr spacetime, there is no nontrivial separated mode solutions to TME which are purely ingoing at horizon and purely outgoing at infinity. This yields a representation formula for solutions to inhomogeneous Teukolsky equations, and will play a crucial role in generalizing the above energy and Morawetz estimates results to the full subextremal Kerr case.",gnd:4013941-4 gnd:4373715-8
Characterizing the transposome and its activity,"Sequencing technologies enabled us to decode sequence of bases that shape the genome and to identify sequence stretches with biological functions, such as genes. Such technologies also enable us to study the expression and regulation base sequences. Intriguingly, transposable elements (TEs) can occupy a substantial proportion of a genome. However, quantification of TE expression remains challenging due to their high sequence similarity and the limited lengths of base sequences decoded by state-of-the-art sequencing technologies. I evaluated five TE quantification software applications with respect to their performance in quantifying the expression of individual TEs. My tool evaluation was based on simulated datasets created using publicly available as well as self-implemented simulation software. I showed that modified SalmonTE can be applied for reliable differential expression analyses in model and non-model organisms. Consequently, I applied modified SalmonTE to study (differentially) TE expression in blood, brain, and skin of mice of different ages (6 and 24 months). While previous family-level studies of TE expression identified up-regulation of TEs as a characteristic of aging, my results indicate that individual TEs are also commonly down-regulated during aging. Integration of transcription start site sequencing data identified TEs with their own promoters, revealing that these elements can be regulated by transcription factors of the Sox family. Co-regulation of TEs and host genes indicates potential biological functions of independently expressed TEs. Together, this study revealed the expression dynamics of individual TEs during aging and provides a comprehensive resource of independently expressed TEs. These data can be a promising starting point to intensify research into locus-specific TE expression to gain a better understanding of the biological functions, interactions, and regulation of TEs.",gnd:4150352-1 gnd:4263977-3 gnd:4122166-7 gnd:4068596-2 gnd:4176601-5 gnd:4142063-9 gnd:4233582-6
Deep learning of virtual marine sensors,"['This thesis proposes an approach to build virtual sensors based on machine learning to replace broken physical sensors.

The Plasma membrane Intrinsic Proteins (PIPs) in grey poplar Populus . canescens -identification of the PIP gene family and characterization of its function on multi-scale,"Zusammenfassung: This PhD thesis provides a molecular and physiological evaluation of the functionality of the PIP subfamily of aquaporins in leaf water relations and CO2 flux, of grey poplar (Populus x canescens) as a tree model system.Plasma membrane intrinsic proteins (PIPs) are widely studied in herbaceous plants; however, little is known regarding their role in water and CO2 transport in woody species. In the perennial woody plant Populus × canescens, 15 PIP genes were cloned and, according to the phylogenic analysis, all these genes had high homology with their Populus trichocarpa orthologs. The transcript abundance of the 15 PcPIP genes was examined in six different tissues of Populus × canescens, including young/mature/old leaves, roots, phloem and xylem. All PcPIP genes, except PIP2;8 and PIP2;10, were expressed in all above mentioned tissues. However, significant difference was present at the level of expression. To reveal the function of PIPs in poplar, transgenic poplar plants were generated in which the translation of PIP genes was down-regulated by RNA interference (RNAi). To target the two main groups of PIPs two specific RNAi cassettes for PIP1 and PIP2 genes were constructed. The on/off-target analysis revealed no additional targets of the two RNAi sequences besides PIP genes. With the PcPIP-RNAi transgenic plants, molecular screening was done on the transcript level by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and on the protein level by ELISA respectively. Based on these results, three PcPIP-RNAi transgenic lines were selected, in which PIP genes were the most down regulated.With the selected PcPIP-RNAi transgenic lines, a series of physiological and morphological studies were performed to characterize the plant’s response under optimal and multi-scale stress (elevated CO2, drought and heat stress) conditions. Under optimal conditions, the leaves of the PcPIP-RNAi transgenic lines had wider opened stomata and therefore had a higher net CO2 assimilation and transpiration rate compared with the wild type (WT) and empty vector control (EV) plants. As a consequence of the re-organization of the cellular structures, the leaves from PcPIP-RNAi transgenic plants had greater mesophyll conductance for CO2 (gm), higher leaf hydraulic conductance (Kleaf) and higher apoplastic water flux and overall, the leaves were smaller.

From unstructured to structured : context-based named entity mining from text,"With recent advances in the area of information extraction, automatically extracting structured information from a vast amount of unstructured textual data becomes an important task, which is infeasible for humans to capture all information manually. Named entities (e.g., persons, organizations, and locations), which are crucial components in texts, are usually the subjects of structured information from textual documents. Therefore, the task of named entity mining receives much attention. It consists of three major subtasks, which are named entity recognition, named entity linking, and relation extraction.

Quantum state transfer in diffractive and refractive media,"Abstract: High-dimensional, discrete quantum states, also known as qudits, offer several advantages over their two- dimensional counterpart (qubits). For example, in quantum communication, the use of qudits not only increases the amount of information encoded into a single carrier, but also enhances the security of quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols. In particular, in entanglement-based QKD the intervention of an eavesdropper can be excluded by the violation of a Bell-type inequality, which is the more violated the larger the dimensionality of the employed states.<br>Spanning a discrete infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light can be used to realize such high-dimensional quantum systems. Moreover, the non-linear process of spontaneous parametric down conversion naturally provides biphoton states entangled in a large number of OAM modes. However, the defining feature of photons carrying OAM, namely their helical phase front, is strongly perturbed by disturbances along the light propagation path. In this thesis, we study how different perturbations influence OAM entanglement, and how we can counteract their detrimental effects.<br>We first consider the entanglement losses induced by diffraction on obstructions or apertures. In this setting, we derive an analytical expression for the entanglement losses depending only on the overlap between the diffracted images of the OAM modes used to encode the entanglement. With the help of this expression, we investigate the role of the radial structure of the encoding modes in mitigating entanglement losses due to diffraction. In particular, we show that entanglement encoded in multi-ring Bessel-Gaussian modes is more resilient against diffraction than that encoded into single ring Laguerre-Gaussian modes. Moreover, using the uncertainty relation for angular position and angular momentum, we demonstrate that the entanglement of a biphoton state, with well defined OAM, past a ""cake-slice"" aperture is a universal function of the product of the angular uncertainty defined by the aperture and of the OAM of the encoding modes.<br>The use of OAM entanglement in free-space quantum communication is severely limited by phase distortions introduced by random refractive index fluctuations due to atmospheric turbulence. In this dissertation, we discuss the efficiency of adaptive optics (AO) in mitigating turbulence-induced OAM entanglement losses, for a vast range of atmospheric conditio ...",gnd:4047990-0
Rainfall partitioning and soil water dynamics along a tree species diversity gradient in a deciduous old-growth forest in Central Germany,"Species diversity effects have been extensively investigated in grassland ecosystems, however, little is known about the influence of tree species diversity on the forest water cycle. In this dissertation several hydrological processes including soil water dynamics, rainfall partitioning and the related ion deposition with rainfall have been investigated along a tree species diversity gradient. In addition, the results were used to model the water cycle. The studies were conducted in twelve study plots in old-growth deciduous forest stands in the Hainich National Park, Germany. Monospecific plots were formed by Fagus sylvatica (beech) and mixed forest plots consisted of a variable admixture of up to eleven broad-leaved deciduous tree species such as Tilia spec., Fraxinus excelsior, Carpinus betulus, and Acer pseudoplatanus. The first part of this thesis presents the partitioning of rainfall into throughfall, stemflow, and interception along the tree species diversity gradient.

Nonlinear approximation and function space of dominating mixed smoothness,"As the main object of this thesis we study a generalization of function spaces with dominating smoothness. The basic idea for this generalization is based on a splitting of the d variables into N groups of possibly varying length. In this way the usual spaces of dominating mixed smoothness as well as the classical isotropic spaces occur as special cases (for d groups of length one each or for 1 group of length d, respectively). More precisely, we will study first Sobolev-type spaces, and afterwards Besov- and Triebel-Lizorkin-type spaces are introduced. For these spaces several basic properties such as Fourier multipliers and duality are discussed. As the main tool for further studies characterizations by local means are proved. The main result of the first part of the thesis consists in a characterization by tensor product Daubechies wavelets. One immediate corollary of this characterization is the identification of certain Besov spaces of dominating mixed smoothness as tensor products of isotropic ones, establishing a connection to many recent discussions in high-dimensional approximation.",gnd:4127922-0 gnd:4134834-5 gnd:4202326-9

Model-driven security in service-oriented architectures : leveraging security patterns to transform high-level security requirements to technical policies,"Service-oriented Architectures (SOA) facilitate the provision and orchestration of business services to enable a faster adoption to changing business demands. Web Services provide a technical foundation to implement this paradigm on the basis of XML-messaging. However, the enhanced flexibility of message-based systems comes along with new threats and risks. To face these issues, a variety of security mechanisms and approaches is supported by the Web Service specifications. The usage of these security mechanisms and protocols is configured by stating security requirements in security policies. However, security policy languages for SOA are complex and difficult to create due to the expressiveness of these languages. To facilitate and simplify the creation of security policies, this thesis presents a model-driven approach that enables the generation of complex security policies on the basis of simple security intentions. SOA architects can specify these intentions in system design models and are not required to deal with complex technical security concepts. The approach introduced in this thesis enables the enhancement of any system design modelling languages – for example FMC or BPMN – with security modelling elements. The syntax, semantics, and notion of these elements is defined by our security modelling language SecureSOA. The metamodel of this language provides extension points to enable the integration into system design modelling languages. In particular, this thesis demonstrates the enhancement of FMC block diagrams with SecureSOA. To enable the model-driven generation of security policies, a domain-independent policy model is introduced in this thesis. This model provides an abstraction layer for security policies. Mappings are used to perform the transformation from our model to security policy languages. However, expert knowledge is required to generate instances of this model on the basis of simple security intentions. Appropriate security mechanisms, protocols and options must be chosen and combined to fulfil these security intentions. In this thesis, a formalised system of security patterns is used to represent this knowledge and to enable an automated transformation process. Moreover, a domain-specific language is introduced to state security patterns in an accessible way. On the basis of this language, a system of security configuration patterns is provided to transform security intentions related to data protection and identity management. The formal semantics of the security pattern language enable the verification of the transformation process introduced in this thesis and prove the correctness of the pattern application. Finally, our SOA Security LAB is presented that demonstrates the application of our model-driven approach to facilitate a dynamic creation, configuration, and execution of secure Web Service-based composed applications.zeige weniger",gnd:4261480-6 gnd:4832365-2

"Supergeometry, Super Riemann Surfaces and the Superconformal Action Functional","['This book treats the two-dimensional non-linear supersymmetric sigma model or spinning string from the perspective of supergeometry. The objective is to understand its symmetries as geometric properties of super Riemann surfaces, which are particular complex super manifolds of dimension 1|1. The first part gives an introduction to the super differential geometry of families of super manifolds. Appropriate generalizations of principal bundles, smooth families of complex manifolds and integration theory are developed. The second part studies uniformization, U(1)-structures and connections on Super Riemann surfaces and shows how the latter can be viewed as extensions of Riemann surfaces by a gravitino field. A natural geometric action functional on super Riemann surfaces is shown to reproduce the action functional of the non-linear supersymmetric sigma model using a component field formalism. The conserved currents of this action can be identified as infinitesimal deformations of the super Riemann surface. This is in surprising analogy to the theory of Riemann surfaces and the harmonic action functional on them.

Astrophysical phenomena related to supermassive black holes : searching for local particularities in the center of the Milky Way and extragalactic nuclei at high angular resolution,"All projects aim at pushing the limits of our knowledge about the interaction between a galaxy and a supermassive black hole (SMBH) at its center. The development of a new instrument can be as valuable as combining different datasets. I follow both approaches and developed projects which deal with new instrumentation and telescope technology, combine datasets from different wavelengths and resolutions, and incorporate recent theoretical models and predictions, which can be verified empirically. The first two of the six chapters compile astrophysical and technical background of the individual projects, which are presented in the following four chapters. While the first project (Chapter 3) deals with observations of the innermost parsec of our Galaxy, Chapter 4 presents data of the inner kpc of an active galaxy. The subjects of Chapters 5 and 6 are very luminous AGN/host systems, so-called QSOs. Whereas Chapter 5 presents global, spatially unresolved properties of SMBH/host systems, the radio jet, analyzed in the final Chapter 6, combines all size scales. It is investigated from close to its origin out to several kpc. The accretion onto the black hole of the Milky Way (Chapter 3) is extremely inefficient and the SMBH possibly interacts dominantly via tidal forces only. The next discussed system (Chapter 4) is the prototype of moderately luminous Seyfert 2 AGN, NGC 1068. Here a strong local influence of the nuclear X-ray radiation is observed. Chapter 5 deals with the possible global importance of radiative interaction between highly luminous QSO AGN and the host.

About the role of physico-chemical properties and hydrodynamics on the progress of a precipitation reaction : the case of cerium oxalate particles produced during coalescence of drops,"The size and morphology control of precipitated solid particles is a major economic issue for numerous industries. For instance, it is interesting for the nuclear industry, concerning the recovery of radioactive species from used nuclear fuel. The precipitates features, which are a key parameter from the post-precipitate processing, depend on the process local mixing conditions. So far, the relationship between precipitation features and hydrodynamic conditions have not been investigated. In this study, a new experimental configuration consisting of coalescing drops is set to investigate the link between reactive crystallization and hydrodynamics. Two configurations of aqueous drops are examined. The first one corresponds to high contact angle drops (>90°) in oil, as a model system for flowing drops, the second one correspond to sessile drops in air with low contact angle (<25°). In both cases, one reactive is dissolved in each drop, namely oxalic acid and cerium nitrate. When both drops get into contact, they may coalesce; the dissolved species mix and react to produce insoluble cerium oxalate. The precipitates features and effect on hydrodynamics are investigated depending on the solvent. In the case of sessile drops in air, the surface tension difference between the drops generates a gradient which induces a Marangoni flow from the low surface tension drop over the high surface tension drop. By setting the surface tension difference between the two drops and thus the Marangoni flow, the hydrodynamics conditions during the drop coalescence could be modified. Diols/water mixtures are used as solvent, in order to fix the surface tension difference between the liquids of both drops regardless from the reactant concentration. More precisely, the used diols, 1,2-propanediol and 1,3-propanediol, are isomer with identical density and close viscosity. By keeping the water volume fraction constant and playing with the 1,2-propanediol and 1,3-propanediol volume fractions of the solvents, the mixtures surface tensions differ up to 10 mN/m for identical/constant reactant concentration, density and viscosity. 3 precipitation behaviors were identified for the coalescence of water/diols/recatants drops depending on the oxalic excess. The corresponding precipitates patterns are visualized by optical microscopy and the precipitates are characterized by confocal microscopy SEM, XRD and SAXS measurements. In the intermediate oxalic excess regime, formation of periodic patterns can be observed. These patterns consist in alternating cerium oxalate precipitates with distinct morphologies, namely needles and “microflowers”. Such periodic fringes can be explained by a feedback mechanism between convection, reaction and the diffusion.",gnd:4130676-4 gnd:4147505-7 gnd:4121443-2 gnd:4260101-0 gnd:4140073-2
Activation of C1 compounds by iron and mackinawite under prebiotic conditions,"The role of iron sulfide minerals for the terrestrial origin of life has been discussed over several decades, but until now not fully resolved. Here, mackinawite (FeSm) was found to be selectively formed from the reaction of a wettened mixture of iron and sulfur powders. The structure and composition of the FeSm was analyzed by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Mössbauer spectroscopy. When the FeSm from the elements was let in contact with different C1 substrates (CO2, CO, KCN, KSCN, KOCN, CS2, CH3SH, [Fe(CN)6]3-/4- and [Fe(CN)5(NO)]2-) a range of reaction products (CS2, COS, C1 to C5 hydrocarbons, C1 to C4 thiols and oxygenated species) were formed at 25 ° and 80 °C in the presence of various acids (HCl, H2SO4 and H3PO4). Based on the product array, a novel reduction mechanism could be formulated where the sulfide end-groups of the FeSm particles interact with the C atom of the different substrates. To support this assumption, the reduction of KCN was investigated by DFT calculations on an all ferrous Fe4S44 cluster. The nucleophilic attack of a deprotonated end-group towards the C atom was thereby found to be exothermic by – 75.5 kcal mol-1. The subsequent reduction of the C residue into CH4 and CH3SH proceeds in an overall exothermic manner if electrons and protons are available. The selective reaction between iron and sulfur has the potential to change our current view on prebiotic processes as the established chemistry of iron sulfides can now additionally be discussed for environments, other than undersea hydrothermal systems. The transfer of the FeSm chemistry towards on-land scenarios enables reactions that would not be possible in the omnipresence of H2O. Furthermore, substances like CH3CHO and the cyclic organosulfur compounds are interesting precursors for biologically relevant molecules like DNA, RNA, or organometallic complexes like [FeFe]-hydrogenases.",gnd:4148424-1
Dendrochronology of Central European temperate forest tree species : effects of long-term climate change trends and short-term weather extremes,"['Forests are key biomes linked to biogeochemical cycles, important species reservoirs and major ecosystem services providers.

Expressed as rising average temperatures due to the increase in atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, nitrate oxide and methane, pollutants which are mostly product of burning fuel for industrial activities. These long-term changes will be heterogeneous in time and space throughout the globe. For northeastern Germany, predictions indicate that summer temperature and winter precipitation will be at a constant rise, whereas summer precipitation is expected to decrease, conditions will increase the risk of drought conditions. The changes in long-term means will be accompanied by increased frequency of weather extremes. The overall effect of climate change, both its long- and short-term components and their interaction with forest growth is uncertain. Tree species in the temperate forest are highly adapted to seasonal growth, active in late-spring and summer when temperature thresholds activate primary and secondary growth as well as leaf development, given sufficient water availability.

A framework for artificial coral reef design : Integrating computational modelling and high precision monitoring strategies for artificial coral reefs – an Ecosystem-aware design approach in times of climate change,"Tropical coral reefs, one of the world’s oldest ecosystems which support some of the highest levels of biodiversity on the planet, are currently facing an unprecedented ecological crisis during this massive human-activity-induced period of extinction. Hence, tropical reefs symbolically stand for the destructive effects of human activities on nature [4], [5]. Artificial reefs are excellent examples of how architectural design can be combined with ecosystem regeneration [6], [7], [8]. However, to work at the interface between the artificial and the complex and temporal nature of natural systems presents a challenge, i.a. in respect to the B-rep modelling legacy of computational modelling. The presented doctorate investigates strategies on how to apply digital practice to realise what is an essential bulwark to retain reefs in impossibly challenging times. Beyond the main question of integrating computational modelling and high precision monitoring strategies in artificial coral reef design, this doctorate explores techniques, methods, and linking frameworks to support future research and practice in ecology led design contexts. Considering the many existing approaches for artificial coral reefs design, one finds they often fall short in precisely understanding the relationships between architectural and ecological aspects (e.g. how a surface design and material composition can foster coral larvae settlement, or structural three-dimensionality enhance biodiversity) and lack an integrated underwater (UW) monitoring process. Such a process is necessary in order to gather knowledge about the ecosystem and make it available for design, and to learn whether artificial structures contribute to reef regeneration or rather harm the coral reef ecosystem.  For the research, empirical experimental methods were applied: Algorithmic coral reef design, high precision UW monitoring, computational modelling and simulation, and validated through parallel real-world physical experimentation – two Artificial Reef Prototypes (ARPs) in Gili Trawangan, Indonesia (2012–today). Multiple discrete methods and sub techniques were developed in seventeen computational experiments and applied in a way in which many are cross valid and integrated in an overall framework that is offered as a significant contribution to the field. Other main contributions include the Ecosystem-aware design approach, Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for coral reef design, algorithmic design and fabrication of Biorock cathodes, new high precision UW monitoring strategies, long-term real-world constructed experiments, new digital analysis methods and two new front-end web-based tools for reef design and monitoring reefs. The methodological framework is a finding of the research that has many technical components that were tested and combined in this way for the very first time. In summary, the thesis responds to the urgency and relevance in preserving marine species in tropical reefs during this massive extinction period by offering a differentiated approach towards artificial coral reefs – demonstrating the feasibility of digitally designing such ‘living architecture’ according to multiple context and performance parameters. It also provides an in-depth critical discussion of computational design and architecture in the context of ecosystem regeneration and Planetary Thinking. In that respect, the thesis functions as both theoretical and practical background for computational design, ecology and marine conservation – not only to foster the design of artificial coral reefs technically but also to provide essential criteria and techniques for conceiving them.",gnd:4195671-0 gnd:4001183-5 gnd:4113937-9 gnd:4012494-0 gnd:4136879-4 gnd:4002851-3 gnd:4055382-6
Longitudinal Double-Spin Asymmetry of Electrons from Heavy Flavor Decays in Polarized p + p Collisions at √s = 200 GeV,"In this thesis, the measurement of double-spin asymmetry for electron production from heavy flavor decays was performed in a Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) in the PHENIX experiment at Brookhaven National Laboratory to measure the polarized parton distribution function of gluon in the small Bjorken x region (x~0.01).   For this experiment, for the first time a Hadron Blind Detector (HBD), which is a position-sensitive gas Cherenkov counter with Gas Electron Multiplier whose surface is evaporated by CsI, was employed. This HBD contributes to reducing the background from electron pairs produced by real and virtual photon conversion. Furthermore, the author develops a new analysis method for the background reduction, and the signal-to-background ratio is improved by a factor of roughly 2.0. Using the combination of the HBD and a new analysis method, the double-spin asymmetry of the electron production with transverse momentum ranging 0.5 < pT < 3.0 GeV/c is measured and confirmed to be zero-consistent within the limit of the statistical uncertainty of about 1%.

On the exact simulation of (skew) Brownian diffusions with discontinuous drift,"This thesis is focused on the study and the exact simulation of two classes of real-valued Brownian diffusions: multi-skew Brownian motions with constant drift and Brownian diffusions whose drift admits a finite number of jumps. The skew Brownian motion was introduced in the sixties by Itô and McKean, who constructed it from the reflected Brownian motion, flipping its excursions from the origin with a given probability. Such a process behaves as the original one except at the point 0, which plays the role of a semipermeable barrier. More generally, a skew diffusion with several semipermeable barriers, called multi-skew diffusion, is a diffusion everywhere except when it reaches one of the barriers, where it is partially reflected with a probability depending on that particular barrier. Clearly, a multi-skew diffusion can be characterized either as solution of a stochastic differential equation involving weighted local times (these terms providing the semi-permeability) or by its infinitesimal generator as Markov process.",gnd:4128130-5 gnd:4128328-4 gnd:4274463-5

The selective epitaxial growth (SEG) method has been used to deposit SiGe as stressor material in S/D regions to induce uniaxial strain in the channel region. The thesis investigates issues of process integration in IC production and concentrates on the key parameters of high-quality SiGe selective epitaxial growth, with a special focus on its pattern dependency behavior and on key integration issues in both 2D and 3D transistor structures, the goal being to improve future applications of SiGe SEG in advanced CMOS']",gnd:4010319-5 gnd:4135644-5 gnd:4244347-7 gnd:4732034-5 gnd:4077445-4 gnd:4131472-4 gnd:4659870-4
"Understanding the impact of heterozygosity on metabolism, growth and hybrid necrosis within a local Arabidopsis thaliana collection site","Plants are unable to move away from unwanted environments and therefore have to locally adapt to changing conditions. Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis), a model organism in plant biology, has been able to rapidly colonize a wide spectrum of environments with different biotic and abiotic challenges. In recent years, natural variation in Arabidopsis has shown to be an excellent resource to study genes underlying adaptive traits and hybridization’s impact on natural diversity. Studies on Arabidopsis hybrids have provided information on the genetic basis of hybrid incompatibilities and heterosis, as well as inheritance patterns in hybrids. However, previous studies have focused mainly on global accessions and yet much remains to be known about variation happening within a local growth habitat. In my PhD, I investigated the impact of heterozygosity at a local collection site of Arabidopsis and its role in local adaptation.

Renewable imidazolium zwitterions as platform molecules for the synthesis if ionic liquids and materials,"Following the principles of green chemistry, a simple and efficient synthesis of functionalised imidazolium zwitterionic compounds from renewable resources was developed based on a modified one-pot Debus-Radziszewski reaction. The combination of different carbohydrate-derived 1,2-dicarbonyl compounds and amino acids is a simple way to modulate the properties and introduce different functionalities. A representative compound was assessed as an acid catalyst, and converted into acidic ionic liquids by reaction with several strong acids. The reactivity of the double carboxylic functionality was explored by esterification with long and short chain alcohols, as well as functionalised amines, which led to the straightforward formation of surfactant-like molecules or bifunctional esters and amides. One of these di-esters is currently being investigated for the synthesis of poly(ionic liquids).

"Analysis and management of low flows in small catchments of Brandenburg, Germany","Water management and environmental protection is vulnerable to extreme low flows during streamflow droughts. During the last decades, in most rivers of Central Europe summer runoff and low flows have decreased. Discharge projections agree that future decrease in runoff is likely for catchments in Brandenburg, Germany. Depending on the first-order controls on low flows, different adaption measures are expected to be appropriate. Small catchments were analyzed because they are expected to be more vulnerable to a changing climate than larger rivers. They are mainly headwater catchments with smaller ground water storage. Local characteristics are more important at this scale and can increase vulnerability. This thesis mutually evaluates potential adaption measures to sustain minimum runoff in small catchments of Brandenburg, Germany, and similarities of these catchments regarding low flows. The following guiding questions are addressed: (i) Which first-order controls on low flows and related time scales exist? (ii) Which are the differences between small catchments regarding low flow vulnerability? (iii) Which adaption measures to sustain minimum runoff in small catchments of Brandenburg are appropriate considering regional low flow patterns? Potential adaption measures to sustain minimum runoff during periods of low flows can be classified into three categories: (i) increase of groundwater recharge and subsequent baseflow by land use change, land management and artificial ground water recharge, (ii) increase of water storage with regulated outflow by reservoirs, lakes and wetland water management and (iii) regional low flow patterns have to be considered during planning of measures with multiple purposes (urban water management, waste water recycling and inter-basin water transfer). The question remained whether water management of areas with shallow groundwater tables can efficiently sustain minimum runoff. Exemplary, water management scenarios of a ditch irrigated area were evaluated using the model Hydrus-2D. Increasing antecedent water levels and stopping ditch irrigation during periods of low flows increased fluxes from the pasture to the stream, but storage was depleted faster during the summer months due to higher evapotranspiration. Fluxes from this approx. 1 km long pasture with an area of approx. 13 ha ranged from 0.3 to 0.7 l\s depending on scenario. This demonstrates that numerous of such small decentralized measures are necessary to sustain minimum runoff in meso-scale catchments. Differences in the low flow risk of catchments and meteorological low flow predictors were analyzed. A principal component analysis was applied on daily discharge of 37 catchments between 1991 and 2006. Flows decreased more in Southeast Brandenburg according to meteorological forcing. Low flow risk was highest in a region east of Berlin because of intersection of a more continental climate and the specific geohydrology. In these catchments, flows decreased faster during summer and the low flow period was prolonged. A non-linear support vector machine regression was applied to iteratively select meteorological predictors for annual 30-day minimum runoff in 16 catchments between 1965 and 2006. The potential evapotranspiration sum of the previous 48 months was the most important predictor (r²=0.28). The potential evapotranspiration of the previous 3 months and the precipitation of the previous 3 months and last year increased model performance (r²=0.49, including all four predictors). Model performance was higher for catchments with low yield and more damped runoff. In catchments with high low flow risk, explanatory power of long term potential evapotranspiration was high. Catchments with a high low flow risk as well as catchments with a considerable decrease in flows in southeast Brandenburg have the highest demand for adaption. Measures increasing groundwater recharge are to be preferred. Catchments with high low flow risk showed relatively deep and decreasing groundwater heads allowing increased groundwater recharge at recharge areas with higher altitude away from the streams. Low flows are expected to stay low or decrease even further because long term potential evapotranspiration was the most important low flow predictor and is projected to increase during climate change. Differences in low flow risk and runoff dynamics between catchments have to be considered for management and planning of measures which do not only have the task to sustain minimum runoff.",gnd:4171871-9 gnd:4026309-5

In this study the influence of different alternative electron acceptors and the redox potentials on the reductive dechlorination of PCE by S. multivorans was investigated. During the growth of S. multivorans the redox potential of the cultivation media changed and was, depending on the used substrates, adjusted to values between -250 mV and -50 mV. The redox potential of the medium was adjusted by the usage of redox active compounds and by potentiostat-controlled graphite electrodes.

Asymptotically free Gauged-Yukawa systems,"In this thesis we take a fresh look at asymptotic freedom for gauged-Yukawa models from a perspective that supersedes conventional studies within standard perturbation theory. In fact, our findings can be viewed as a generalization of previous investigations for non-Abelian Higgs models to systems which include a fermionic matter sector. We start with a minimalistic toy-model containing only a Yukawa and a QCD-like gauge sector. We then extend the analysis to a larger class of models which include the whole non-Abelian sector of the Standard Model. In both models we discover the existence of novel asymptotically free trajectories beyond standard perturbation theory. We construct such trajectories as quasi-fixed points for the Higgs scalar potential, whose couplings approach the noninteracting Gaußian fixed point with specific scalings with respect to the asymptotically free gauge couplings. We corroborate our findings in an effective-field-theory approach, and subsequently we obtain a comprehensive picture using the functional renormalization group. The latter method allows us to study the stability of the scalar potential for large field amplitudes. In contrast to standard perturbation theory, these new solutions become visible beyond the deep-Euclidean-regime, because of the important role of mass-threshold effects. Since one-loop universality is no longer guaranteed once threshold corrections are included, we investigate whether the existence of these ultraviolet complete trajectories is universal, i.e., a scheme-independent feature. We consider a wide class of regularization schemes that account for threshold behavior persisting in the infinite-energy limit, firstly focusing on the conventional minimal subtraction scheme and subsequently on mass-dependent schemes based on general momentum-space infrared regularizations. We argue that the existence of these asymptotically free solutions is a scheme-independent phenomenon.",gnd:4297710-1 gnd:4186918-7 gnd:4177773-6
Characterization of macromolecular systems by mass spectrometry and hyphenated techniques,"The focus of this thesis was to gain in-depth structural information of synthetic polymers by the application of several combined techniques. The second chapter provides an overview about the influence of the polymer architecture on its characterization by mass spectrometry and complementary methods. In the third chapter, we demonstrate the use of MS, more specifically MALDI-ToF MS, which provides molar masses and dispersity values for poly(furfuryl glycidyl ether) (PFGE). The second example is the study of poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) (PNiPAm) copolymers with glyco-monomers with specific combinations of matrices and cationization agents. The fourth chapter will combine three different examples regarding linear, star-shaped and hybrid polymers, which were analyzed by advanced techniques. The linear copolymers were analyzed by separating them according to their chemical heterogeneity using liquid absorption chromatography at critical conditions (LACCC) of poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline) (PEtOx), followed by automated spotting onto a MALDI target, which was subsequently analyzed by MALDI. Secondly, star-shaped polymers: [poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)-b-PEtOx]8 were monitored firstly by using LACCC of linear PEO as first separation dimension and furthermore injected onto an SEC column confirming the molar mass. Lastly, a hybrid PEO star-shaped polymer was investigated using MALDI to verify the complete functionality of the core with PEO arms. Finally, the last chapter will focus on the creation of a software to obtain information regarding average composition, overcoming isotopic, overlapping peaks and isobaric species from MS spectra. Moreover, the quantitative studies were carried out by correction of the mass discrimination and isotopic abundance. Consequently, advanced analytical techniques such as different ionization techniques within MS, a range of chromatographic hyphenation and computational methods are implemented for elucidating the complexity of synthetic polymers.",gnd:4046699-1 gnd:4009840-0 gnd:4586449-4

Die Rolle des Gens Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia-1 (DISC1) während der tangentialen Migration kortikaler Interneurone der Maus,"The gene “Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia-1” (DISC1) got into the scientific focus of Psychiatrists and Neurobiologists at the beginning of the century. A disruption of this gene was discovered within members of a Scottish family, who have a higher predisposition to develop schizophrenia spectrum disorders (Chubb et al., 2008). The DISC1 gene encodes a protein, which showed multiple functions in neuronal cells, e.g. during proliferation, migration and positioning of neurons or the development of synapses. In this doctoral thesis the role of DISC1 during neuronal migration, especially interneuron migration was examined. These cells make up around 20% of all cortical neurons, thus representing a minority of neurons in the cortex. However, they are highly diverse in morphological as well as functional aspects and are necessary for the correct balance between excitation and inhibition in the brain. Thus it has been described, that patients with epilepsy, autism or schizophrenia display deficits in cortical interneurons. (Le Magueresse and Monyer, 2013) In the present study it has been shown, that DISC1 is necessary for the correct tangential migration of interneurons in mice. The gene is expressed at embryonic stage E14.5 in precursor cells of parvalbuminergic interneurons deriving from the MGE. Using RNA interference techniques it was possible to successfully down regulate the DISC1 expression in those neurons, thereafter they react with a reduced migratory behavior. The dynamic observation of DISC1-deficient interneurons showed that the complex process of the saltatory movement of these cells was disturbed. This process is realized by cytoskeletal components and it was found that the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in DISC1-deficient interneurons was incorrect. In addition to the migration defect examined in vitro, this scenario could be reproduced in vivo using in utero electroporation to transfect MGE-derived interneurons with DISC1 or control miRNA. These experiments showed that fewer cells reached the cortex if they were transfected with DISC1-miRNA compared to the transfection with control constructs. These findings provide a possible link between clinical studies reporting alterations of cortical interneurons in schizophrenic patients and the current notion of schizophrenia as a neurodevelopmental disorder (Lewis and Levitt, 2002).",gnd:4052527-2 gnd:4314951-0 gnd:4129358-7 gnd:4475549-1
Extended Personal Media Networks (XPMN),"XMPP, P2P, Usability, Security, Mobile Media. - The recent years have brought many changes to the way consumers interact with media assets.

Cosmological backreaction : from the local Hubble expansion rate to dark energy,"Despite the glorious successes of modern cosmology, our understanding of the cosmic substitution is still limited to a tiny fraction (a few per cents only). Accelerated expansion of the Universe, caused by the mysterious dark energy is currently the most severe crisis in cosmology, even in physics. In this dissertation, we argue that light may be shed on this crisis by means of the cosmological backreaction mechanism in the averaging problem in inhomogeneous and anisotropic space-time. Due to the non-commutation of temporal evolution and spatial averaging, the averaged Einstein tensor as the function of the perturbed metric is not trivially equal to the Einstein tensor of the averaged metric. Consequently, inhomogeneities and anisotropies (cosmic structures) influence the evolution of the background Universe. In order to obtain the quantitative information of this mechanism, we combine Buchert's non-perturbative framework with cosmological perturbation theory, calculate the relevant averaged physical observables up to third order in the comoving synchronous gauge (both temporal and spatial dependence) and discuss their gauge dependence. With the help of an integrability condition, the leading higher order contributions follow from the lower order calculations. We demonstrate that the leading contributions to all the averaged physical observables under consideration are specified completely on the boundary of the averaged domain. For any finite domain, these surface terms are nonzero in general, and thus backreaction is for real.",gnd:4381626-5 gnd:7589166-9

"South Asian summer monsoon variability, a modelling study with the atmospheric regional climate model HIRHAM5","The lives of more than 1/6 th of the world population is directly affected by the caprices of the South Asian summer monsoon rainfall. India receives around 78 % of the annual precipitation during the June-September months, the summer monsoon season of South Asia. But, the monsoon circulation is not consistent throughout the entire summer season. Episodes of heavy rainfall (active periods) and low rainfall (break periods) are inherent to the intraseasonal variability of the South Asian summer monsoon. Extended breaks or long-lasting dryness can result in droughts and hence trigger crop failures and in turn famines. Furthermore, India's electricity generation from renewable sources (wind and hydro-power), which is increasingly important in order to satisfy the rapidly rising demand for energy, is highly reliant on the prevailing meteorology.

Tracking the molecular background of phenotypic change in fruit evolution and plant domestication,"Understanding molecular changes of phenotypic adaptation are central goals in evolutionary biology. This thesis contributes to these goals by presenting two case studies comparing the molecular network of fruit dehiscence in three Brassicaceae species that differ in prominent fruit traits and by summarizing data on the molecular background of convergent crop domestication. Fruits of L. campestre and A. thaliana share a common mechanism of dehiscence but differ in overall morphology. Data presented here highlight that despite this morphological variability the molecular pathway of fruit dehiscence is conserved between both species. My results further contribute to a better understanding of Brassicaceae fruit development by identifying the transcription factors ALC and SPT to be repressors of IND gene expression.L. appelianum is a close relative of L. campestre and serves as a representative of those Brassicaceae species that have evolved indehiscent fruits. The molecular change causing this phenotypic adaptation is identified to be a loss of expression of dehiscence zone identity genes at the valve-replum border of L. appelianum fruits.Plant domestication is often accompanied by dramatic phenotypic changes, presenting an excellent model to study molecular principles of adaptation. A survey of genes known to carry causative mutations responsible for domestication-related changes reveals that convergent plant domestication is often based on mutations at orthologous loci. Furthermore, factors are identified that influence the probability of a certain gene to serve as a target for mutations driving phenotypic adaptation. This thesis combines studies targeting the molecular background of phenotypic conservation as well as phenotypic change and searches for general patterns that may allow explaining or even predicting the likely course of molecular evolution. The results are of relevance for basic evolutionary biology and future agronomic applications, alike.",gnd:4293074-1 gnd:4812902-1 gnd:4141299-0 gnd:4165631-3 gnd:4165953-3

Shape Optimization Design of Arch Type Dams under Uncertainties,"Due to an increased need for hydro-electricity, water storage, and flood protection, it is assumed that a series of new dams will be built throughout the world. Comparing existing design methodologies for arch-type dams, model-based shape optimization can effectively reduce construction costs and leverage the properties of construction materials. To apply the means of shape optimization, suitable variables need to be chosen to formulate the objective function, which is the volume of the arch dam here. In order to increase the consistency with practical conditions, a great number of geometrical and behavioral constraints are included in the mathematical model. An optimization method, namely Genetic Algorithm is adopted which allows a global search. Traditional optimization techniques are realized based on a deterministic approach, which means that the material properties and loading conditions are assumed to be fixed values. As a result, the real-world structures that are optimized by these approaches suffer from uncertainties that one needs to be aware of. Hence, in any optimization process for arch dams, it is nec- essary to find a methodology that is capable of considering the influences of uncertainties and generating a solution which is robust enough against the uncertainties. The focus of this thesis is the formulation and the numerical method for the optimization of the arch dam under the uncertainties. The two main models, the probabilistic model, and non-probabilistic models are intro- duced and discussed. Classic procedures of probabilistic approaches un- der uncertainties, such as RDO (robust design optimization) and RBDO (reliability-based design optimization), are in general computationally ex- pensive and rely on estimates of the system’s response variance and fail- ure probabilities. Instead, the robust optimization (RO) method which is based on the non-probabilistic model, will not follow a full probabilistic approach but works with pre-defined confidence levels. This leads to a bi-level optimization program where the volume of the dam is optimized under the worst combination of the uncertain parameters. By this, robust and reliable designs are obtained and the result is independent of any as- sumptions on stochastic properties of the random variables in the model. The optimization of an arch-type dam is realized here by a robust optimiza- tion method under load uncertainty, where hydraulic and thermal loads are considered. The load uncertainty is modeled as an ellipsoidal expression. Comparing with any traditional deterministic optimization (DO) method, which only concerns the minimum objective value and offers a solution candidate close to limit-states, the RO method provides a robust solution against uncertainties. All the above mentioned methods are applied to the optimization of the arch dam to compare with the optimal design with DO methods. The re- sults are compared and analyzed to discuss the advantages and drawbacks of each method. In order to reduce the computational cost, a ranking strategy and an ap- proximation model are further involved to do a preliminary screening. By means of these, the robust design can generate an improved arch dam structure which ensures both safety and serviceability during its lifetime.",gnd:4064700-6 gnd:4057020-4

Human and automatic speech recognition in the presence of speech-intrinsic variations,"['The aim of this thesis is the analysis and improvement of automatic speech recognition (ASR). Since the human auditory system outperforms current ASR systems in almost all conditions, the recognition performance of man and machine was compared in a first step. Based on the differences, the signal processing mechanisms were identified that are suitable to increase the robustness of ASR. The comparison focused on the influence of intrinsic variations of speech, i.e., changes in speaking rate, effort and style, as well as dialect and accent. The results show that the processing of temporal cues in ASR bears room for improvement. Therefore, spectro-temporal features were employed for ASR, which resulted in an increase of recognition performance for varying speaking effort and speaking style compared to standard features.

Comparison of stochastic processes by Markov projection and functional Itô calculus,Abstract: In this thesis a systematic approach to the comparison of stochastic processes is pursued. In particular the classes of Markov processes and semimartingales are considered. Comparison results for the one-dimensional marginals of Markov processes are established and then transferred to semimartingales by the method of Markov projections. Also a direct comparison of one-dimensional marginals of general semimartingales is accomplished. This then is generalized to more-dimensional marginals by functional Itô calculus,gnd:4134948-9 gnd:4180967-1 gnd:4329325-6
Canopy structure and the impact of drought on a Quercus suber L. woodland in Portugal,"The thesis covers two topics, a performance evaluation of indirect leaf area index L and gap probability Pgap observation with the new digital cover photography DCP with special focus on the application in sparse canopies and the analysis of drought effects on water / carbon fluxes in a typical Mediterranean Quercus suber L. ecosystem. L and Pgap are important ecosystem parameters. Their indirect, height and angular distributed measurement remains a challenging task in open canopies. DCP was successfully applied here for the first time height and angular dependent. Results show similar Pgap compared to an established method. Clumping index Omega could be successfully derived by DCP for calculating L. DCP yielded precise L matching observations with litter traps. Woody component exclusion by object-based image analysis improved results. Ground-based crown observations yielded reasonable L height distributions compared with direct measurements. Plant species developed vast structural and functional adaptations to regulate carbon assimilation and respiratory water loss under drought. In the context of the extreme drought year 2012, drought effects on the entire ecosystem functioning are reported in the second part of the thesis. Therefore, multi-year observations of climate forcing, soil properties as well as ecosystem flux observations were conducted and combined stomatal conductance-photosynthesis modeling was applied and evaluated. Results show that precipitation effectiveness ET/P increased up to 122\% in the dry year 2012 due to the ground water access of trees. Understorey and overstorey gross primary productivity and were reduced by 53\% and 28\% in 2012.

The ecological implications of tyrosine-supplementing symbioses in grain pest beetles,"Symbiosis has repeatedly enabled insects to tap into the rich metabolic repertoire of microorganisms, thereby enabling them to gain access to improved nutritional and defensive capabilities. In herbivorous beetles, nutritional symbionts that supplement their hosts’ diet with tyrosine precursors via the shikimate pathway used for cuticle biosynthesis are especially pervasive. In this doctoral thesis, I elucidate how tyrosine-supplementing symbionts mediate life history traits and ecological interactions in diverse grain pest beetles. I first show that while the intracellular symbiont Shikimatogenerans is present in all life stages of O. surinamensis, there is a life-stage specific increase in symbiont density during metamorphosis and early adulthood. This dramatic symbiont increase coincides with an increased demand for symbiont-provisioned tyrosine precursors used to accelerate cuticle biosynthesis. A time-series analysis of cuticle development further showed that symbiotic beetles form their cuticles more rapidly than do their experimentally symbiont-depleted (aposymbiotic) counterparts. However, host investment into symbiont proliferation is metabolically costly, and this cost was reflected in a delayed onset of reproduction in symbiotic females. Furthermore, I demonstrated an ecological benefit of these associations by showing that survival against predators and pathogens increases rapidly in young symbiotic beetles when compared to aposymbiotic beetles, thus correlating with accelerated symbiont-mediated cuticle formation. Finally, I demonstrated that shikimate-pathway encoding symbionts are generally widespread in beetles. Symbiont-mediated tyrosine provisioning thus transcends specialised intracellular symbionts and is a function that may also be fulfilled by loosely associated general gut microbial communities. The work of this thesis yields insights into the broader (and often understudied) benefits of nutritional symbionts.",gnd:4277329-5 gnd:7558129-2 gnd:4044890-3 gnd:4186526-1 gnd:4157755-3

Query processing on spatio-temporal data streams from moving objects,"['The amount of spatio-temporal data, i.e. location data from moving objects, that is available in real time is increasing continuously due to the expanding availability of small and cheap GPS-sensors as well as mobile internet connectivity. This work examines the processing of such data streams, for example, to identify objects that will probably move to close to each other. This is done with data stream management systems (DSMS) on the foundation of the interval approach together with the moving object algebra. The concept is implemented with an open source DSMS. The main idea of the approach is a generic algebra, which combines the concepts of the interval approach for data streams with the moving object algebra for moving object data. The resulting concept allows very flexible continuous spatio-temporal queries on data streams. The approach is evaluated with location data streams from AIS signals from vessels.', 'Die Menge an in Echtzeit verfügbaren spatio-temporalen Daten, also Positionsdaten von sich bewegenden Objekten nimmt durch die steigende Verbreitung von mobilen Datenverbindungen und kleinen GPS-Empfängern stetig zu.

Going from a 2-oscillator system to a ring of oscillators, we encounter the intriguing phenomenon of chimera states which are partial synchrony patterns with coexisting domains of synchronized and desynchronized dynamics. For more than a decade scientist have tried to solve the puzzle of this spontaneous symmetry-breaking emerging in networks of identical elements. We provide an analysis of initial conditions and extend our model by the addition of time delay and fractal connectivities. In the second part, we investigate partial synchronization patterns in a neuronal network and explain dynamical asymmetry arising from the hemispheric structure of the human brain. A particular focus is on the novel scenario of partial relay synchronization in multiplex networks.

The plasma parameter regime is characterized by comparably high collision frequencies and comparably high plasma-p exceeding the electron-ion mass ratio. Single Langmuir probes and a poloidal probe array are used for spatiotemporal studies of drift waves as well as for characterization of background plasma parameters. The main goals are the identification of a low-frequency instability and its major destabilization mechanisms. All experimentally observed features of the instability were found to be consistent with drift waves. A new code, based on a non-local cylindrical linear model for the drift wave dispersion, was used to gain more insight into the dominating destabilzation mechanisms, and also into dependencies of mode frequencies and growth rates on different parameters. In the experiment and in the numerical model, poloidal mode structures were found to be sheared. Part II of the thesis reports about mode-selective spatiotemporal synchronization of drift wave dynamics in a low-P plasma. Active control of the fluctuations is achieved by driving a preselected drift mode to the expense of other modes and broadband turbulence. It is demonstrated that only if a resonance between the driver signal and the drift waves in both space and time is reached, the driver has a strong influence on the drift wave dynamics. The synchronization effect is qualitatively well reproduced in a numerical simulation based on a Hasegawa-Wakatani model.']",gnd:4253297-8 gnd:4046249-3 gnd:4168580-5
"Suspended sediments in the Kharaa River, sources and impacts","Anthropogenically amplified erosion leads to increased fine-grained sediment input into the fluvial system in the 15.000 km2 Kharaa River catchment in northern Mongolia and constitutes a major stressing factor for the aquatic ecosystem.

Determinants of tourism and its potential for sustainable economic development : empirical evidence,"Like in several sectors of consumer demand, attitudes, believes, and the political environment may also influence the worldwide demand for tourism. Consequentially, this thesis concentrates on a wider range of determinants including non-economical factors of tourism demand and supply in both the country of origin and destination at a worldwide scale. So, the aim of the thesis was to show how the most relevant economical, geographical and socio-cultural determinants influence the demand for tourism. The second intent was to analyze whether and how (sustainable) tourism can be a trigger for economic development. The thesis comprises four main chapters composed of four single published papers. The results show that tourism is able to enhance economic growth in countries specialized in this industry. However, this requires some special condition in both the country of origin and the country of destination. We show that tourism is a superior good, as the development level measured by income in the country of origin plays a major role in explaining tourism demand. Hence, it is evidenced that an increasing willingness to pay for outbound tourism goes hand in hand with an increasing per capita income in the world. However, cultural openness of a society is an important precondition from the country of origins' point of view. Regarding the tourism exporting countries (countries of destination), the most interesting outcome of the thesis is that biodiversity as proxy for ""nice nature"" is an important supply factor; besides the countries' cultural heritages, good governance and visitor's safety as well. Together with the tourism's potential to enhance economic growth, this reflects the value biodiversity can play for economic development. Hence, the most important requirement for this mechanism is the allocation of property rights on biodiversity to private or public (land-) owners to give them an economic incentive to use ""their"" nature sustainably.",gnd:4018406-7 gnd:4326464-5
Spatio-spectral engineering of entangled and single photons in parametric down-conversion,"Photon pairs generated through SPDC inherently exhibit spatio-spectral coupling, which implies that photons with different spatial DOFs possess varying spectra. While quantum optics applications often focus on either spatial or spectral DOFs independently, the correlation between them poses a fundamental challenge in protocols involving entangled photon sources or single-mode photon states. Theoretical studies on SPDC, that address both space and spectrum together, are mostly limited to approximate wave functions of photon pairs or involve numerical computations. Such theoretical studies usually consider either monochromatic signal and idler photons (the narrowband approximation), loosely focused pump and collection beams (the plane wave approximation), or infinitesimally thin crystals (the thin crystal approximation). This dissertation aims to bridge the gap between the fundamental theory of SPDC and its practical applications. In particular, we have developed a comprehensive theory that does not rely on a specific pump beam or nonlinear crystal and goes beyond the common narrowband, plane wave, and thin crystal approximations. The developed approach accurately describes the inseparability of spatial and spectral DOF and applies to a wide range of experimental setups. Furthermore, we show that the origin of the spatio-spectral coupling is closely related to the Gouy phase of the interacting beams. We utilize the developed theory, taking into account the spatio-spectral coupling insights, to control the entanglement of photon pairs from SPDC. As an application, we shape the spatial distribution of the pump beam to design an efficient source of high-dimensional entangled states in the spatial DOF. In our second application, we tailor simultaneously the effective nonlinearity of the crystal and spatial distribution of the pump, to engineer single-mode photons.",gnd:4045922-6 gnd:1149179627
Hard x-ray microscopy enhanced by coherent image reconstruction,"X-ray microscopy is used to study the structure, dynamics and bulk properties of matter with high spatial resolutions. It is widely applied, from physics and chemistry to material and life sciences. In the past two decades, progress in X-ray microscopy was driven either by improvements in X-ray optics or by improvements in the image reconstruction by using algorithms as computational lenses. In this work both approaches are combined to exploit the advantages of X-ray imaging with a large numerical aperture and the advantages of coherent image reconstruction. It is shown that a combined X-ray microscope using both, advanced optics and algorithms, is neither limited by flawed optics nor by constraints imposed by reconstruction algorithms, which enables to go beyond current limits in resolution and applications. The thesis is structured in four parts. In the first part hard X-ray lenses, so called multilayer zone plates, are simulated to investigate volume diffraction effects within the multilayer structure, and to study the potential for smaller focus sizes and higher efficiencies. In the second part, the multilayer zone plates are characterized and implemented in an X-ray microscope. In the third part, a new imaging scheme is presented, which combines in-line holography and coherent diffractive imaging. This method overcomes the current resolution limit of in-line holography and can achieve super-resolution with respect to the numerical aperture of the illuminating beam. Finally, in the fourth part a multilayer zone plate is used as an objective lens with a known transfer function in a novel coherent full-field imaging experiment based on iterative phase retrieval, for high resolution and quantitative contrast.",gnd:4178315-3

Multi-step linear discriminant analysis and its applications,"['We introduce a multi-step machine learning approach and use it to classify data from EEG-based brain computer interfaces. This approach works very well for high-dimensional EEG data. First all features are divided into subgroups and linear discriminant analysis is used to obtain a score for each subgroup. Then it is applied to subgroups of the resulting scores. This procedure is iterated until there is only one score remaining and this one is used for classification. In this way we avoid estimation of the high-dimensional covariance matrix of all features. We investigate the classifi cation performance with special attention to the small sample size case. For the normal model, we study the asymptotic error rate when dimension p and sample size n tend to in nity. This indicates how to de fine the sizes of subgroups at each step. In addition we present a theoretical error bound for the spatio-temporal normal model with separable covariance matrix, which results in a recommendation on how subgroups should be formed for this kind of data. Finally some techniques, for example wavelets and independent component analysis, are used to extract features of some kind of EEG-based brain computer interface data.', 'Maschinelles Lernen, Statistik, Hoch-dimensionale Daten, Statistics, High-Dimensional Data, Classification']",gnd:7862975-5 gnd:4193754-5 gnd:4056995-0
"Lignin valorization : extraction, characterization and applications","The topic of this project is the use of lignin as alternative source of aromatic building blocks and oligomers to fossil feedstocks. Lignin is known as the most abundant aromatic polymer in nature and is isolated from the lignocellulosic component of plants by different possible extraction treatments. Both the biomass source and the extraction method affect the structure of the isolated lignin, therefore influencing its further application. Lignin was extracted from beech wood by two different hydrothermal alkaline treatments, which use NaOH and Ba(OH)2 as base and by an acid-catalyzed organosolv process. Moreover, lignin was isolated from bamboo, beech wood and coconut by soda treatment of the biomasses. A comparison of the structural features of such isolated lignins was performed through the use of a wide range of analytical methods. Alkaline lignins resulted in a better candidate as carbon precursor and macromonomers for the synthesis of polymer than organosolv lignin. In fact, alkaline lignins showed higher residual mass after carbonization and higher content of the reactive hydroxy functionalities. In contrast, the lignin source turned out to slightly affect the lignin hydroxyl content. One of the most common lignin modifications is its deconstruction to obtain aromatic molecules, which can be used as starting materials for the synthesis of fine chemicals. Lignin deconstruction leads to a complex mixture of aromatic molecules. A gas chromatographic analytical method was developed to characterize the mixture of products obtained by lignin deconstruction via heterogeneous catalytic hydrogenolysis. The analytical protocol allowed the quantification of three main groups of molecules by means of calibration curves, internal standard and a preliminary silylation step of the sample. The analytical method was used to study the influence of the hydrogenolysis catalyst, temperature and system (flow and batch reactor) on the yield and selectivity of the aromatic compounds. ...",gnd:4016062-2 gnd:4006877-8
Transiting Sub-stellar companions on intermediate-mass stars,"The aim of the project is to evaluate the predictions from theories of planet formation by determining the absolute frequency of close-in planets of intermediate-mass stars (IMSs). The detection of close-in planets of IMSs can put constraints to the theories of planet formation. First, it is known from infrared observations that the lifetimes of protoplanetary discs of IMSs are half as long as those of solar-mass stars. Second, radial velocity surveys of evolved IMSs show that the frequency of planets at distances larger than 5 AU is higher in comparison to solar-mass stars. However, not much is known about the frequency of close-in planets. An important key to constrain processes of planet formation and evolution is, thus, answering the question: “Is  the  frequency  higher  for  close-in  planets  of  IMSs  than for solar-mass stars?” The transit method is best suited to find such planets. First, it is not affected by the fast rotation of these stars and secondly, it favours the detection of close-in planets. I used the CoRoT database to survey all IMSs observed with this instrument. In contrast to ground- based surveys, the precision of CoRoT allows the detection of all Jupiter-sized transiting objects orbiting IMSs. I first determined the mass-distribution of the stars in the sample. Second I found 14 transit candidates of IMSs in the CoRoT survey and observed them spectroscopically to determine their masses. In result, I detected one planet as well as two very young brown dwarfs with large radii of IMSs by this survey. Among them, the first transiting brown dwarf of a B-type star. The frequency for close-in planets of IMSs derived from this survey is 0.11 ± 0.04 %. This means that close-in sub-stellar companions of IMSs are rare. In the context of disc-migration, this surprising result can be explained by the lifetime of the protostellar discs of IMSs. It is apparently long enough for the planets to form, but on average too short for them to migrate inwards.",gnd:4291270-2 gnd:4180348-6 gnd:4320078-3 gnd:4456110-6 gnd:4174796-3

Renormalization Group Analysis of Equilibrium and Non-equilibrium Charged Systems,"This thesis has two parts, each based on an application of the renormalization-group (RG). The first part is an analysis of the d-dimensional Coulomb gas. The goal was to determine if the Wilson RG could provide input into particle-in-cell simulations in plasma physics, which are the main family of simulation methods used in this field. The role of the RG was to identify the effect of coarse-graining on the coupling constants as a function of the cut-offs. The RG calculation reproduced established results, but in a more concise form, and showed the effect of the cut-offs on the Debye screening length. The main part of the thesis is the application of the dynamic RG to turbulence in magnetohydrodynamics. After transformation to Elsasser variables, which is a symmetrisation of the original equations, the solution is presented as a functional integral, which includes stirring forces, their conjugates and functional Jacobian.

Synchronization and Waves in Active Media,"['Introduction -- Confined Scroll Rings -- Target Wave Synchronization on a Network -- Spiral Wave Chimera -- Appendix: Dimensional Reduction of Oscillators and Oscillatory Patterns', 'The interplay between synchronization and spatio-temporal pattern formation is central for a broad variety of phenomena in nature, such as the coordinated contraction of heart tissue, associative memory and learning in neural networks, and pathological synchronization during Parkinson disease or epilepsy. In this thesis, three open puzzles of fundametal research in Nonlinear Dynamics are tackled: How does spatial confinement affect the dynamics of three-dimensional vortex rings? What role do permutation symmetries play in the spreading of excitation waves on networks? Does the spiral wave chimera state really exist? All investigations combine a theoretical approach and experimental verification, which exploit an oscillatory chemical reaction. A novel experimental setup is developed that allows for studying networks with N > 1000 neuromorphic relaxation oscillators. It facilitates the free choice of network topology, coupling function as well as its strength, range and time delay, which can even be chosen as time-dependent.

Tissue and population-level diversity in plant secondary metabolism : a systematic exploration using MS/MS structural analysis,"Plants are amazing synthetic chemists that create diversified secondary metabolites which play myriad ecological roles for their survival and reproductive fitness in nature. The structural complexity of secondary metabolism has severely hampered its functional analysis. The potential of MS-based metabolomics and of the large-scale acquisition of tandem MS (MS/MS) spectra is limited by the absence of straightforward classification and visualization pipelines so that secondary metabolite and the underlying pathway interpretations can be easily made. From a mechanistic standpoint, secondary metabolism diversity attributes to the occurrence of multiplicity of genes in plant genomes. Yet the majorities of metabolic gene functions remain however unknown. In this thesis, I developed a workflow to systematically explore the diversity of secondary metabolism in Nicotiana attenuata – a metabolically rich ecological model plant. I first characterize the metabolic space of this model plant using the large-scale acquisition of MS/MS spectral information in a data-independent manner and the computational re-assembly of non-redundant MS/MS spectra. The resulting MS signatures were then aligned and visualized to rapidly formulate structural hypotheses. Using natural variation, I examined the correlations among jasmonate signaling and large-scale defense metabolism. The resulting correlation maps uncovered new metabolic layers in a plant’s jasmonate-mediated defensive arsenal. In the tissue-level exploration of secondary metabolite diversity, Transciptomic and metabolomic information and their variance as analyzed by information theory were used for the predictions of tissue-specific function of genes responsible for the metabolic signatures.",gnd:4207952-4 gnd:4045539-7 gnd:4300564-0
Density functional theory based embedding for molecular and periodic systems,"Complex chemical systems pose formidable challenges to electronic structure theory. While density functional theory (DFT), a popular lower-level quantum mechanical method, can efficiently handle large systems with hundreds of atoms, it is plagued by issues such as self-interaction error and the use of approximate exchange-correlation functionals. On the other hand, correlated wavefunction theory (WFT) methods like coupled cluster (CC) theories, are much more accurate but prohibitively expensive for systems with more than $\sim50$ atoms. Therefore, balancing accuracy against computational cost is crucial when selecting an electronic structure method. Usually, the relevant and interesting chemical phenomenon tends to be localized to a small active region of the complete system, such as the adsorption site of the molecule, or the vicinity of the defect. This is where embedding techniques come into the picture. Embedding methods offer a promising compromise to bridge the accuracy versus cost gap, by allowing to split the larger system into an active and environment subsystem. The active subsystem, which is the region of interest, can then be treated using a more accurate and computationally demanding method while the environment can be treated using a lower-level theory like DFT and the influence of the environment on the active subsystem is accounted for by the chosen embedding formalism. This thesis presents a practical and efficient implementation of density functional theory (DFT) based embedding, wherein the environment is treated at the DFT level, and its influence on the active subsystem is accounted for via an embedding potential which is a functional of the subsystem densities. The implementation supports both periodic and aperiodic systems, with the essence being the expansion of orbitals and electron density using Gaussian basis functions, rather than plane waves.",gnd:4258514-4

Study of preplasma properties using time-resolved reflection spectroscopy,"The aim of this work was to develop a new diagnostic method to probe preplasma properties in laser-plasma interaction experiments, using the time-resolved measurement of the laser pulse reflected by the plasma. Its spectral change over time can be attributed to the motion of the critical-density position of the plasma, which can be correlated with the preplasma properties that are present at the beginning of the interaction. 2-D particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations showed a correlation between the blue shift of the spectrum at the temporal beginning of the laser pulse and the expansion velocity of the preplasma, which can be used to derive the corresponding electron temperature. In addition, a correlation between the acceleration of the reflection point into the plasma and the density scale length has been observed. This has also been confirmed by an analytical description of the holeboring velocity and acceleration, which has been developed to include the effect of the preplasma scale length. To verify this method, two experimental campaigns were performed at the PHELIX laser system, while employing different temporal contrasts using so-called plasma mirrors. The experimental observations matched the predictions made by the numerical simulations. By comparing the maximum red shift of the spectrum with the results of the analytical description, the scale length of the preplasma was determined to be (0.18+-0.11) μm and (0.83+-0.39) μm with and without plasma mirror, respectively. At last, two further experimental campaigns to improve laser-ion acceleration at PHELIX were carried out. First, by increasing the laser absorption during the interaction using a p-polarized laser pulse and second, by increasing the laser intensity. The latter led to the generation of protons with a maximum energy of up to 93 MeV, for a laser intensity in the range of 8e20 W/cm^2, resulting in a new record for the laser system PHELIX.",gnd:4034610-9 gnd:4064937-4 gnd:4046249-3
"The changing nature of economic value : indigenous forest garden values in Kalimanatan, Indonesia","This book deals with economic values in the broader context of science and in the specific context of natural and social systems. The aim of this book is to explain and contribute to solving the divergence between value in economic theory and in social reality, in particular the reality of indigenous Dayak societies in Kalimantan, Indonesia. An economic theory that does not account for the many goods and services provided by the environment - termed bad economics by Schumacher (1993) - is commonly believed to be the cause of environmental deterioration. Various valuation techniques have been developed in order to close this gap and to come up with a total economic value of ecosystems.

Alpine habitat dynamics and avian biodiversity in different land-use regimes on the eastern Tibetan Plateau,"Abstract: Biodiversity–environment relationships are of core interest to both ecologists and conservationists. Ecological models have predicted local biodiversity patterns in relation to distributions of key environmental variables in space and time. Anthropogenic activities further complicate the biodiversity–environment relationships. Human disturbances can impact directly on the coexistence of species by intervening in the processes of competitive exclusion. Human land-uses modulate the habitat dynamics of natural systems and influence the biodiversity patterns therein, which is often accompanied by a legacy effect. Different conservation principles have arisen based on positive or negative perceptions of the human impacts on biodiversity. For instance, the wilderness approach advocates keeping nature pristine and undisturbed by humans. Contrarily, the cultural landscape approach puts current ecosystem structure into the context of evolution and human history, thus suggests that human-created habitats are crucial in maintaining the locally adapted species assemblage. <br>The goal of this dissertation was to understand the human–habitat–biodiversity interconnections through conducting an interdisciplinary study in the alpine grassland landscape of the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, which is one center of bird endemism of Asia. The research also aimed to make science-based conservation recommendations for the protection of the Tibetan avifauna.<br>To disentangle human impacts on the vegetation changes of alpine pastures in eastern Tibet, I integrated oral history study, participatory GIS and remote sensing analysis of Landsat and MODIS time-series in order to detect the turning points of land-use and land-cover changes. Results showed that privatizations of livestock and pastures since 1984 triggered the recent grassland degradation. South-facing, mild-slope winter pastures located in higher altitudes were most susceptible to the degradation. With a time-lag of thirty years, the degradation turning point was detected in the year 2006. However, the non-synchronized land-use and land-cover changes confused local people’s perceptions of the causality. This finding bears implications for conservation management, which puts increasing weight on the traditional ecological knowledge (chapter 5).<br>To examine the species–environment relationship of the eastern Tibetan bird assemblage, I first developed a comprehensive set of habitat predictors empl ...",gnd:4259046-2 gnd:4063673-2 gnd:4601495-0

The objective of this study is therefore to investigate the reaction of a numerical model of the North Atlantic and Arctic Ocean to changes in the atmospheric surface forcing and to improve the understanding of the internal variability of the model and furthermore the real ocean-sea ice system. The ocean model is based on the MOM-2 code, which is coupled to a dynamic-thermodynamic sea ice model with a viscous-plastic rheology.

High-dimensional function approximation : breaking the curse with Monte Carlo methods,"In this dissertation we study the information-based complexity for high-dimensional function approximation problems. In the deterministic setting for many unweighted problems the curse of dimensionality holds, that means, for some fixed error tolerance the complexity grows exponentially with the dimension. For integration problems one can usually break the curse with the standard Monte Carlo method. For function approximation problems, however, similar effects of randomization have been unknown so far. The thesis contains results on three more or less stand-alone topics. Chapter 2 is concerned with lower bounds for the Monte Carlo error for general linear problems via Bernstein numbers. This technique is applied to the uniform approximation of certain classes of smooth functions, where it turns out that randomization does not affect the tractability classification of the problem. Chapter 3 studies the uniform approximation of functions from Hilbert spaces with methods that may use arbitrary linear functionals as information. For certain unweighted periodic tensor product spaces, in particular Korobov spaces, we observe the curse of dimensionality in the deterministic setting, whereas with randomized methods we achieve polynomial tractability. Chapter 4 deals with the approximation of monotone functions via function values. It is known that this problem suffers from the curse of dimensionality in the deterministic setting. A new upper bound shows that Monte Carlo methods do break the curse. Almost matching lower bounds are found as well, from which follows that randomization will not help significantly for small error tolerances.",gnd:4002498-2 gnd:4240945-7 gnd:4176929-6 gnd:4120913-8
Entwicklung und Gestaltungspotenzial von Fahrzeugsitzen unter Einsatz dielektrischer Elastomeraktoren,"['The aim of this work is, to develop a new free deformable area and its actuators. Based on mechanically active polymer compounds - dielectric elastomers - technical and aesthetic freedoms can be increased. A low density in combination with high activation strains are the advantages of the dielectric elastomer. This leads to flat and lightweight transducers for a free deformable area, which is shown on the basis of a new concept for an automotive seat. Recently, the increasing functionality in car seats, especially in comfort, is achieved by use of manual and pneumatic adjustments or electric motors and gears. Hence, complexity, weight and the fuel consumption rise. Furthermore room for the car´s occupants decreases, due to the space taken by the adaptive seats. Both, the technical and the user demands - user wishes - are part of the development process in this work. By means of mechanical, electrical, as well as chemical and electromechanical measurements the material properties of the dielectric elastomer are gathered. With respect to that, a new leafspring-actuator is designed. Furthermore, arm-like structures of leafspring-actuators are engineered and tested for application in car seats. An analytical model describes the static behavior of the actuators, while finite element models are used as a tool for design and optimization of these active structures. Moreover, new ground for interior design, due to the modular build-up of the actuators can be broken, by almost identical expenditure of time and design effort. With the help of a demonstrator, made from a thin plane of polyurethane foam, supported by arms of leafspring-actuators, new ways of designing a car seat are presented.', 'Das Ziel dieser Arbeit liegt darin eine frei verformbare Fläche und die dafür benötigte Aktorik zu konzipieren.

Vorteile des hier verwendeten dielektrischen Elastomers, einem elektroaktiven Polymerfilm, liegen in der geringen Dichte und seiner hohen geometrischen Veränderung bei elektrischer Aktivierung. Damit können leichte und flache Verstellelemente konzipiert werden, die zudem eine hohe gestalterische Vielfalt ermöglichen.

Qualitative Spatial Abstraction in Reinforcement Learning,"Reinforcement learning has developed as a successful learning approach for domains that are not fully understood and that are too complex to be described in closed form. However, reinforcement learning does not scale well to large and continuous problems. Furthermore, acquired knowledge specific to the learned task, and transfer of knowledge to new tasks is crucial.   In this book the author investigates whether deficiencies of reinforcement learning can be overcome by suitable abstraction methods. He discusses various forms of spatial abstraction, in particular qualitative abstraction, a form of representing knowledge that has been thoroughly investigated and successfully applied in spatial cognition research. With his approach, he exploits spatial structures and structural similarity to support the learning process by abstracting from less important features and stressing the essential ones. The author demonstrates his learning approach and the transferability of knowledge by having his system learn in a virtual robot simulation system and consequently transfer the acquired knowledge to a physical robot. The approach is influenced by findings from cognitive science.

Polymeromics : structural elucidation of macromolecules via tandem mass spectrometry utilizing various ionization techniques,"The main objective of the presented thesis was to investigate the applicability of mass spectrometry (MS)-based techniques for the analysis of polymers. A variety of MS and tandem MS (MS/MS) techniques were utilized to gain accurate structural information from intricate macromolecular structures and to achieve the fragmentation behavior of several synthetic polymer classes such as various poly(2-oxazoline)s (POx), poly(ethylene imine)s (PEI), and poly(methyl acrylate)s (PMA). MS techniques was used to gain information about their molar mass distributions, PDI values, monomer units, macromolecular architectures, side chain substituents and end-group functionalities. ESI, APCI and MALDI MS were utilized in order to comprehensively analyze synthetic polymers in systematic comparison studies. Additional information about the fragmentation behavior and the stabilities of macromolecules were gained from energy-dependent CID experiments. Survival yield (SY) method was applied to several polymers for the first time and SY curves were shown as a useful tool to correlate the macromolecular structure of polymers to their fragmentation behavior. Moreover, energy dependent CID experiments were also performed successfully to analyze the gas-phase stabilities of various metal complexes. The relative complex stabilities were estimated depending on the nature of the coordinated ligands used in the synthesis of investigated metal complexes. The hyphenation of LC and MS techniques for comprehensive polymer characterization was shown for the case of poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline)s (PEtOx). The characterization of PEtOx copolymers were accomplished by the coupling of a two dimensional chromatography (2D) technique (LCCC x SEC) to MS and MS/MS techniques.

Analysis of the hole shape evolution in ultrashort pulse laser drilling,"Ultrashort laser pulses are capable of generating micro structures with high precision and challenging quality for electronics, optics, medical and automotive applications. However, the realization of microstructures with high aspect-ratio, especially microdrillings, is still a demanding task. Deep drillings show the formation of bulges, a bending of the hole and multiple capillaries. A direct investigation of the drilling process in opaque materials, especially metals, is not feasible and different explanations for the hole shape formation have been developed. The specific contributions of the possible influences on the shape formation are not fully understood yet.In this work, an in-situ observation of drilling in an opaque material is realized for the first time. Silicon is used as a model system for laser drilling in semiconductors and metals. The influence of the processing parameters on the hole shape evolution is studied in detail, in particular for the pulse energy, pulse duration, repetition rate and ambient pressure. The reasons for the special drilling behavior are examined.Apart from parameter-specific dependencies, the drilling process is characterized by three phases: (1) excavation oft the initial capillary, (2) deep drilling with statistical deformation of the hole, (3) stop of forward drilling. The pulse energy is the fundamental process parameter, determining the maximum achievable hole depth largely independent of the fluence. Debris can obstruct the hole capillary and restrain the pulse propagation with a significant influence on the process duration and the achievable depth. The light propagation inside the hole channel has been identified as the main influence on the hole shape formation. Deviations from the ideal hole geometry are induced by beam deflections on hole wall imperfections. In conclusion, a fundamental improvement of quality and precision in ultrashort pulse drilling requires a control of the light propagation inside the hole.",gnd:4205811-9 gnd:4222149-3 gnd:4343533-6

Time series analysis of high resolution remote sensing data to assess degradation of vegetation cover of the island of Socotra (Yemen),"The island of Socotra  has long been in  geographical isolation,  hence  nearly 30% of the  plant species are believed to be endemic to the island. Until the end of 20th century there was only very little and incomplete information and literature about the vegetation on the island. This isolation broke down in 1990 with the country unification in which then the island received much attention. Subsequently the scientific knowledge of the local flora slowly increased, but many of plant species are now reported to be confined into small populations, hence being particularly vulnerable to habitat loss, overgrazing, as well as urban expansion. 1. The overall objective of this research attempted to assess and examine the trends of vegetation changes since 1972 to 2010 with the use of Landsat MSS, TM and ETM+ images and to investigate the related driving factors, such as rainfall, grazing pressure changes and underlying spatial variability of the landscape. This is to answer the overall question: Is there a trend in biomass, cover and species composition on Socotra Island over the last 40 years? If so, is that trend associated with the rainfall patterns? What are the drivers behind the vegetation change? And then how can we define changes in patterns or changes in this study area? 2. From a methodological point of view, our approach of systematically using remote sensing technology data proved scientifically an applicable tool to improve our understanding of the spatial complexity and heterogeneity of the vegetation cover as well as to provide a conceptual method with specific data for monitoring the changes over this time period. Our data obtained from these different Landsat sensors during the study period were - after many sophisticated processing steps - essentially able to provide time series information for Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data and to assess the long term trend in vegetation cover in the island. 3. Moreover, our approach combining supervised maximum-likelihood and unsupervised classification with the pre- and the post-classification approaches besides the knowledge based classification was table to provide sufficient results to distinguish and to map nine (9) terrestrial vegetation cover classes. The overall accuracy (compared with ground truth data) was about 91%, 77%, 70% and 72% for the images 2005, 1994, 1984 and 1972 respectively. Consecutively, the GIS analysis allowed estimates of highly valuable information as absolute areas and relative coverage of particular vegetation classes over the island with their spatial distribution and also their ecological requirements. Analysis of climatic conditions and NDVI 4. As a results of the complex topography of the study area and the wide climate range, with the guidance of prior knowledge of functional relationships between site parameters, ecosystem and the specific form of biological production, our work resulted in a division of the entire area into six variously sized ecosystem units, which were enough to properly depict the spatial heterogeneity of the rainfall and vegetation and to assist reflecting the influence and reaction between environmental parameters as well as it might have significance both for development of resources and for conservation of environment.",gnd:4596027-6 gnd:4127298-5

Decoding insect feeding : identification of regulatory components mediating insect-specific defense responses in plants,"Nicotiana attenuata has the capacity to respond specifically to herbivory by its natural herbivore, Manduca sexta, through the perception of elicitors in larval oral secretions (OS). Fatty acid-amino acid conjugates (FACs) in the OS of the M. sexta larvae elicit the herbivory-specific responses in N.attenuata, an annual wild tobacco species. How FACs are perceived and activate signal transduction mechanisms is unknown. To find transcriptional targets of the FAC signal transduction pathway with the goal of identifying regulatory components of insect mediated responses, I used the SuperSAGE technique.

Krümmungs-Kapazitäts-Beziehungen gewellter Elektroden in elektrochemischen Doppelschichtkondensatoren,"['Like capacitors, the storage mechanism of electrochemical double-layer capacitors is based on the formation of electrostatic fields between the electrodes and a double layer formed by the ions in the electrode-electrolyte interface. Beside cycle stability and the charging and discharging speed the performance is also characterized by the capacity of the electrodes. However the capaitance is strongly influenced by the size of the electrode surface on which it is possible for the electrolyte ions to accumulate in the form of a double layer. Due to their high surface area, amorphous carbons are considered typical electrode materials for common supercapacitors. Among others, these electrodes are characterized by convex and concave curvatures, among other things. However, the interaction of convex and concave regions and their superposition have rarely been investigated. In addition this work demonstrates a large impact of nanoscale surface curvatures, either convex or concave, on the capacitive performance of supercapacitors. Molecular dynamics simulations of trilayer graphene electrodes with convex and concave curved regions of different curvature radii are performed to describe this interaction in more detail. A 1.5 M solution of the ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazoliumhexafluorophosphate [BMI][PF6] and acetonitil as solvent serves as the electrolyte. The definition of constant potentials at the electrodes allows the determination of the charge of each electrode atom depending on the time-dependent electrolyte configuration. The results show a variable behavior of the differential capacitance with respect to different curvature radii both for the overall electrode and when the concave and convex regions were plotted separately. Furthermore, this work describes the influence of the electrode curvature on the orientation of the cations adsorbed on the electrode surface and the composition of the ionic layer accumulated in the electrode-electrolyte-interface and correlates this influence with the differential capacitance peaks. The evaluation of more exhaustive simulations of selected systems by using the Unbinned Weighted Histogram Analysis Method (UWHAM) provides a higher statistical accuracy and allows the results to be presented as a continuous function of the applied potential. These calculations also reveals potential-dependent fluctuations of the differential capacitance, the compostion of the ionic layer and the cation orientation. If the curvature radii are of the same order of magnitude as the ions, the restricted space in the electrode-electrolyte interface causes a reduced number of possibilities for the orientation of the ions within this interface. This leads to changes in free energy compared to flat electrodes or electrodes with significantly larger curvature radii. Furthermore, the capacitance peaks of the negative electrode can be related not only to variations in the composition of the Helmholtz layer of the negative electrode, but also to variations at the positive electrode. It is found that both the applied potential and the electrode curvature determine the occurrence of capacitive peaks in the convex and concave regions and thus determine the capacitive performance of the electrode. Furthermore, by calculating a charge-charge covariance matrix from the charge fluctuations of the electrode atoms, the influence of individual atomic electrode charges or defined regions of the electrode on the distinct nontrivial features of the differential capacitance can be quantified in a sophisticated manner. This method can also be applied to more complex electrode models with different pore geometries, thus showing the influence of different morphological characteristics on the capacitance. For this reason, the method presented here can serve as a tool in defining design criteria of future electrodes.', 'Der Speichermechanismus elektrochemischer Doppelschichtkondensatoren beruht wie bei den Kondensatoren auf der Ausbildung elektrostatischer Felder zwischen den Elektroden und einer in der Elektroden-Elektrolyt-Grenzschicht entstehenden Doppelschicht. Hierbei wird die Leistungsfähigkeit neben der Zyklenstabilität und der Lade- und Entladegeschwindigkeit auch durch die Kapazität der Elektroden charakterisiert. Die kapazitive Leistungsfähigkeit ist maßgeblich durch die Größe der für das Elektrolyt zugänglichen Elektrodenoberfläche bestimmt, an der sich die Elektrolytionen als Doppelschicht anlagern. Aufgrund ihrer hohen Oberfläche gelten amorphe Kohlenstoffe als typische Elektrodenmaterialien für gängige Superkondensatoren. Diese Elektroden kennzeichnen sich jedoch unter anderem durch konvexe und konkave Krümmungen. In diesem Zusammenhang wurden bereits verschiedene Elektrodengeometrien und die Ausbildung der Doppelschicht, sowie der kapazitiven Leistungsfähigkeit in der Literatur beschrieben. Die hier präsentierte Arbeit zeigt darüber hinaus einen großen Einfluss nanoskaliger Oberflächenkrümmungen, entweder konvex oder konkav, auf die kapazitive Leistungsfähigkeit von Superkondensatoren. Das Zusammenwirken von konvexen und konkaven Bereichen und deren Überlagerung wurden in der Literatur bisher aber nur selten betrachtet. Zur näheren Beschreibung dieser Wechselwirkung erfolgen molekulardynamische Simulationen von dreilagigen Graphenelektroden mit konvex und konkav gekrümmten Bereichen verschiedener Krümmungsradien. Als Elektrolyt dient eine 1,5 M Lösung aus der ionischen Flüssigkeit 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazoliumhexafluorophosphat [BMI][PF6] und Acetonitril als Lösungsmittel. Die Verwendung konstanter Potentiale an den Elektroden ermöglicht die Bestimmung der Ladung jedes Elektrodenatoms abhängig von der zeitabhängigen Elektrolytkonfiguration. Die in dieser Arbei präsentierten Ergebnisse zeigen sowohl für die Gesamtelektrode als auch bei einer separaten Darstellung der konkaven und konvexen Bereiche ein fluktuierendes Verhalten der differentiellen Kapazität bezüglich verschiedener Krümmungsradien. Darüber hinaus beschreiben die Ergebnisse den Einfluss der Elektrodenkrümmung auf die Ausrichtung der an der Elektrodenoberfläche adsorbierten Kationen und die Zusammensetzung der in der Elektroden-Elektrolyt-Grenzschicht akkumulierten Ionenschicht und verbinden diesen Einfluss mit den unterschiedlichen Kapazitätsspitzen. Zu Gunsten einer höheren statistischen Genauigkeit, sowie der Ergebnisdarstellung über eine kontinuierliche Potentialdifferenz zwischen beiden Elektroden erfolgen im Anschluss an ausgewählten Systemen umfangreichere Simulationen und eine Auswertung mittels der Unbinned Weighted Histogram Analysis Method (UWHAM). Diese Rechnungen offenbaren ebenfalls potentialabhängiges Fluktuationen der differentiellen Kapazität, der Zusammensetzung der Ionenschicht und der Kationorientierung. Liegen die Krümmungsradien in der Größenordnung der verwendeten Ionen, so bewirkt der eingeschränkte Raum in der Elektroden-Elektrolyt Grenzschicht eine verringerte Zahl an Möglichkeiten für die Ausrichtung der Ionen innerhalb dieser Grenzschicht. Dies führt verglichen mit flachen Elektroden oder Elektroden mit deutlich größeren Krümmungsradien zu Änderungen der freien Energie. Weiterhin lassen sich die kapazitiven Spitzen der negativen Elektrode nicht nur mit Schwankungen in der Zusammensetzung der Helmholtzschicht der negativen Elektrode, sondern auch mit Schwankungen an der positiven Elektrode in Verbindung setzen. Es zeigt sich, dass sowohl das angelegte Potential als auch die Elektrodenkrümmung über das Auftreten kapazitiver Spitzen in den konvexen und konkaven Bereichen entscheiden und somit die kapazitive Leistungsfähigkeit der Elektrode bestimmen. Darüber hinaus ermöglicht die Berechnung einer Ladungs-Ladungs-Kovarianzmatrix aus den Ladungsfluktuationen der Elektrodenatome den Einfluss einzelner atomarer Elektrodenladungen oder definierter Bereiche der Elektrode auf die ausgeprägten nicht-trivialen Merkmale der differentielle Kapazität differenziert zu quantifizieren. Diese Methode ist auch auf komplexere Elektrodenmodelle mit unterschiedlichen Porengeometrien anwendbar, um so den Einfluss unterschiedlicher morphologischer Charakteristika auf die Kapazität zu quantifizieren. Aus diesem Grund kann die hier vorgestellte Methode als Hilfsmittel bei der Definition von Designkriterien zukünftiger Elektroden dienen.']",gnd:4701310-2

Study and optimization of the morphological characteristics of nanostructures for heterogeneous catalysis applications : theoretical study,"Abstract: The distinct organization of nanostructured materials influences several catalytic characteristics, like selectivity, sensitivity or catalytic efficiency, which are important issues in catalytic applications, such as fuel cells and electrochemical sensors. Indeed, pores on electrodes provide a three-dimensional active area, which results in a high surface area and an increased reaction rate at the electrode. This work draws the attention to the optimal morphology of hierarchical and non-hierarchical nanostructures and the morphological characteristics that lead to a rational design of heterogeneous nanocatalysts, especially that have sluggish kinetics. Such optimization is achieved through a deep understanding of the catalytic activity of porous layers based on the impact of pore morphology on pore accessibility. For that purpose, four types of nanostructures, i.e., hierarchical external, hierarchical internal, non-hierarchical external and non-hierarchical internal nanostructures, were utilized in simulations of the electrode kinetics of organic and bioorganic fuels oxidation.<br><br>Generally, external nanostructures reveal higher utilization of catalytic surface than internal nanostructures. Simulation results of non-hierarchical nanostructures demonstrate that porous layers with small pores and large numbers of pores are selective to the species with high diffusion coefficient because of high pore accessibility. In contrast, porous electrodes with a low number of large pores and a large top surface area are selective to the species with low diffusion coefficient because of low pore accessibility. Nonetheless, the mass transport in hierarchical external nanostructures is the best among the four investigated nanostructures. Hierarchical external nanostructures show an outstanding accessibility of active sites and a kinetic-controlled regime for the species with low diffusion coefficient. In contrast, hierarchical internal nanostructures show slightly less specific activity than nonhierarchical internal nanostructures because of high total diffusional resistance and longer diffusional path.<br><br>For hierarchical nanostructures optimization, macropore-size exhibit the most comprehensive characteristic for evaluating specific activity and current density of hierarchical nanostructures.

In vivo Hypoxia and Aspergillus fumigatus pathogenesis,"Aspergillus fumigatus is a ubiquitous mold found in soil and organic debris that is currently the most frequent cause of airborne invasive fungal infections in immunocompromised individuals. In this study the hypothesis that hypoxia is a stress faced in vivo by A. fumigatus and that the ability to sense, adapt to, and grow in hypoxic conditions is a virulence attribute of this human fungal pathogen was tested. Utilizing specific staining in 3 clinically relevant murine models, it was shown for the first time that hypoxic microenvironments occur at sites of A. fumigatus infection arguing that, A. fumigatus has to be able to adapt to these oxygen-limited conditions in order to cause disease. In this context, a SREBP ortholog was identified and characterized. Importantly, the SREBP null mutant was unable to grow in hypoxia and virtually avirulent. Interestingly, oxygen sensing and hypoxia adaptation mechanisms can be identified in other fungi suggesting an important role for these mechanisms for fungal biology and virulence. In addition, it was found that A. fumigatus utilizes ethanol (EtOH) fermentation in vivo and that this pathway is induced in in vitro hypoxia. While fermentation was shown to not be essential for growth in hypoxia and fungal virulence, it was found that loss of the alcohol dehydrogenase involved in EtOH fermentation under hypoxic conditions resulted in significant changes in the host immune response.",gnd:4075152-1 gnd:4354782-5 gnd:4205990-2 gnd:4480114-2 gnd:4318717-1 gnd:4140660-6 gnd:4128128-7 gnd:4133549-1
Crab flare observations with H.E.S.S. phase II,"The H.E.S.S. array is a third generation Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope (IACT) array. It is located in the Khomas Highland in Namibia, and measures very high energy (VHE) gamma-rays. In Phase I, the array started data taking in 2004 with its four identical 13 m telescopes. Since then, H.E.S.S. has emerged as the most successful IACT experiment to date. Among the almost 150 sources of VHE gamma-ray radiation found so far, even the oldest detection, the Crab Nebula, keeps surprising the scientific community with unexplained phenomena such as the recently discovered very energetic flares of high energy gamma-ray radiation. During its most recent flare, which was detected by the Fermi satellite in March 2013, the Crab Nebula was simultaneously observed with the H.E.S.S. array for six nights. The results of the observations will be discussed in detail during the course of this work. During the nights of the flare, the new 24 m × 32 m H.E.S.S. II telescope was still being commissioned, but participated in the data taking for one night. To be able to reconstruct and analyze the data of the H.E.S.S. Phase II array, the algorithms and software used by the H.E.S.S. Phase I array had to be adapted. The most prominent advanced shower reconstruction technique developed by de Naurois and Rolland, the template-based model analysis, compares real shower images taken by the Cherenkov telescope cameras with shower templates obtained using a semi-analytical model. To find the best fitting image, and, therefore, the relevant parameters that describe the air shower best, a pixel-wise log-likelihood fit is done. The adaptation of this advanced shower reconstruction technique to the heterogeneous H.E.S.S. Phase II array for stereo events (i.e. air showers seen by at least two telescopes of any kind), its performance using MonteCarlo simulations as well as its application to real data will be described.",gnd:4147494-6 gnd:4165371-3

Fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy techniques to quantify molecular interactions and dynamics in complex biological systems,"Living cells rely on transport and interaction of biomolecules to perform their diverse functions. A powerful toolbox to study these highly dynamic processes in the native environment is provided by fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy (FFS) techniques. In more detail, FFS takes advantage of the inherent dynamics present in biological systems, such as diffusion, to infer molecular parameters from fluctuations of the signal emitted by an ensemble of fluorescently tagged molecules. In particular, two parameters are accessible: the concentration of molecules and their transit times through the observation volume. In addition, molecular interactions can be measured by analyzing the average signal emitted per molecule - the molecular brightness - and the cross-correlation of signals detected from differently tagged species. In the present work, several FFS techniques were implemented and applied in different biological contexts. In particular, scanning fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (sFCS) was performed to measure protein dynamics ...",gnd:4017701-4

Building in Assyria : a philological perspective,"Johanna Tudeau offers with this book a sketch of the practice and ideology of building in Assyria based on textual evidence. The study focuses on the Assyrian royal inscriptions and state archives, two of the most comprehensive textual corpora available on the topic. The temporal and spatial framework is necessarily broad, from the rise to the fall of Assyria, from one end of the empire to the other. This stands in contrast with a targeted terminological approach: architectural keywords structure the chapters and these follow the stages of the building process. The findings come together in a chapter devoted to the modern significance of ancient realities, where grounds for the investigation and interpretation of space are proposed to serve philologists and archaeologists alike, hopefully facilitating the exchange between disciplines.",gnd:4002851-3
Assessing biotope vulnerability to landscape changes,"Largescale patterns of global land use change are very frequently accompanied by natural habitat loss. To assess the consequences of habitat loss for the remaining natural and semi-natural biotopes, inclusion of cumulative effects at the landscape level is required. The interdisciplinary concept of vulnerability constitutes an appropriate assessment framework at the landscape level, though with few examples of its application for ecological assessments. A comprehensive biotope vulnerability analysis allows identification of areas most affected by landscape change and at the same time with the lowest chances of regeneration. To this end, a series of ecological indicators were reviewed and developed. They measured spatial attributes of individual biotopes as well as some ecological and conservation characteristics of the respective resident species community. The final vulnerability index combined seven largely independent indicators, which covered exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity of biotopes to landscape changes. Results for biotope vulnerability were provided at the regional level. This seems to be an appropriate extent with relevance for spatial planning and designing the distribution of nature reserves.

Anomalous and Topological Hall Effects in Itinerant Magnets,"This book presents an investigation of the anomalous and topological Hall effects in some itinerant ferromagnets and helimagnets by measurements of Hall effects driven by electrical or heat current. New clarifications are provided for spin-dependent Hall effects induced by the Berry phase, skew scattering, and scalar spin chirality.The author reveals the scattering-free nature of the Berry-phase-induced anomalous Hall current by conducting the first comparative study of electrical and thermal Hall effects. The impurity-element dependence of the anomalous Hall effect caused by skew scattering is systematically investigated in the low-resistivity region for Fe. Two new examples showing a topological Hall effect are found in helimagnets, in which nonzero scalar spin chirality arises from the modulation of spin structure through Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya (DM) interaction. Such a DM-interaction-mediated topological Hall effect is a new type of topological Hall effect. Also the temperature dependence of topological Hall terms in the thermal Hall effect and Nernst-Ettingshausen effect is found to be totally different from that in the electrical Hall effect.These results will be useful for applications of spin current to devices with low power consumption",gnd:4133961-7 gnd:4154129-7 gnd:4023028-4

Cytokinins shape plant-herbivore interactions in Nicotiana attenuata,"Cytokinins (CK), a group of plant hormones, are well known for their functions in growth and development as well as in environmental interactions. Except for some prominent examples like “green islands” and leaf‐galls caused by endophytic insects via CK, only little is known about the function of CK in plant‐insect interaction. In my thesis I have studied the role of CK in the ecological model plant Nicotiana attenuata and two of its most abundant specialized free living herbivores, the larvae of the tobacco hawkmoth Manduca sexta as well as the mirid bug Tupiocoris notatus. I studied the effect of herbivory on CK levels and CK pathway and used transgenic plants with altered CK biosynthesis or perception to demonstrate the effect of CK on expression of herbivore induced defenses (HID). HID follow a developmentally dependent concentration‐gradient predicted by the “Optimal Defense Theory”: High concentrations of HID in young leaves with a higher value for the plants reproductive success, and low levels in old leaves. We observed that CK follow the same gradient and that increasing CK levels in old leaves was sufficient to increase HID levels in old leaves to levels comparable to young leaves. However, this increase in HID did not improve the plants resistance against herbivory. This is possibly due to CK simultaneously inhibiting senesce processes which might be an important part of a plants defense against specialized herbivores. T. notatus seems capable to actively manipulate these senescence processes via CK and stabilize nutrient levels in attacked leaves. With 15N labeled plants we could prove that T. notatus transfers the CK N6‐isopentenyladenine to its hostplant via its oral secretions. A phenomenon so far not described for free living insects. Based on my results I suggest that the role of CK goes far beyond the known cases of endophytes and that CK have rather a key role in the interaction of plants and insects.",gnd:4205701-2
Unraveling predatory-prey interactions between bacteria,"It is known for decades that certain bacteria are capable to use other bacteria as nutrient sources. As a matter of fact, predatory behavior is not uncommon in prokaryotes. Predatory bacteria were found both in terrestrial and in aquatic habitats. To date, however, only a few of these micropredators have been thoroughly characterized with regard to their ecology and predation strategies. In this study, various aspects of the predatory behavior of the hitherto hardly investigated genera Lysobacter and Cupriavidus should be explored. The first goal was to develop tools for investigating the predatory performance of Lysobacter and Cupriavidus strains under laboratory conditions. Since predatory bacteria pursue many different hunting strategies, the design of a generally applicable assay was challenging. Available predation assays are tailored to predator-specific features, such as growth rate, motility and prey range. The best characterized facultative predators are myxobacteria and several predation assays have been established for this bacterial group. Because myxobacterial predation assays were found to be not suitable for testing of Lysobacter and Cupriavidus strains, an alternative predation assay was developed that provides quantitative data on the reduction of bacterial prey and the concomitant growth of the predator. For this purpose, as prey, soil bacteria that produce distinctive pigments or harbor specific antibiotic resistant gene were selected. Following a defined period in which the prey bacteria were incubated together with the predator, the individual populations could easily be distinguished based on the colors of their colonies or antibiotic resistance after plating. With CFU-based predation assay the predatory activity of both genera was verified. Lysobacter spp. and Cupriavidus spp. were shown to consume both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. The second aim was to identify factors that trigger and promote predatory activity. Using the CFU-based predation assay, it was confirmed that the selected Lysobacter spp. were effectively feeding on both Gram-positive and Gram-negative prey under nutrient-deficient conditions",gnd:4004296-0 gnd:4048274-1

Average-Case Analyse parametrisierter und probabilistischer Algorithmen,"In both Theoretical Computer Science and practical work it is a disappointing outcome if the considered problem is NP complete. There is almost no hope for an efficient algorithm. However, many approaches have been developed to overcome this barrier: - The study of parameterized complexity allows in many cases the concentration of the explosion of the running time in a given parameter. - The behavior of problems not only in the worst case but also in average cases are studied. Or the data to work with is slightly perturbed. Then the concept of a smoothed analysis gives new insides - Also sometimes the use of randomness in the computing process can help to circumvent some obstacles. - And maybe an approximation is also nearly as good as an optimal solution. All these approaches are well studied on its own, but interactions between them, and the use of multiple approaches together, is a mostly unstudied field of research. In this thesis we study a part of these interactions for some test problems. We show that the reduction rules, given by Gramm et al., for the Clique-Cover problem with high probability not only reduce “yes” instances, but solve them entirely. We also consider the paradigm of bounded search trees, which is widely used for parameterizd problems. We find that the expected running time of a simple bounded search tree algorithm is much lower than the worst case bound for FPT problems Vertex-Cover and d-Hitting-Set. For certain sets of parameter values expected FPT running time for the W[1] and W[2] complete problems Clique and Hitting-Set is achieved, too. Furthermore, we study a simple probabilistic generalization of greedy approximation algorithms. For the Vertex-Cover, Hitting-Set, and the Triangle-Vertex-Deletion problem we find that the probabilistic algorithms we give have a substantially smaller expected approximation ratio than their deterministic equivalents. There is also a trade off: With more time one can expect better solutions.",gnd:4120591-1 gnd:4138229-8
Intermediate-range ordering and topochemical heterogeneity in binary and ternary silicate glasses,"The fact that glasses can be synthetically produced and engineered allows plenty of opportunity to control their structure. Even though it may sound simple, the glass formation is controlled by physical-chemical principles and any change in the composition, temperature, cooling rate, processing type, etc. impacts the final material - and consequently its properties. While glasses are considered non-crystalline solids due to the absence of longrange periodicity, they show a regular construction, defined by the short-range and intermediate-range order. Their characteristics are described by the topology, which denotes the basic geometrical arrangement of the structural units and allocation of the atoms. At macroscale, for a glass of the same composition, the structure and properties reveal to be homogeneous, independently of the processing, temperature or precursor material. However, at microscale, the same glass may show a different picture, revealing a topological heterogeneity of a few nanometers. Due to technological limitations, the main difficulty is to directly access this region. There is a consensus that the topological heterogeneity, however, manifests as a significant peak at very low temperatures (about 5 K) or low-frequencies (about 1THz or 33 cm−1) by collective vibrational modes. Since the main model for estimating the phonon contribution to the specific heat in a crystal, the Debye model, does not predict any peak at low temperature and there are no models to describe these manifestations in vitreous materials, usually it is considered an anomaly. This anomalous peak has been called Boson peak. Even though it remains as one of the major debated and unsolved problems of condensed-matter physics, intense investigations in these almost 50 years brought an enormous knowledge about most of its characteristics. In order to access the intermediate-range order and the topochemical heterogeneity of selected binary and ternary glass network formers made by reactive powder sintering process, investigations of the vibrational density of states in the region of the Boson peak has been conducted. Foremost, this study describes that the feature of the Boson peak is governed by topological heterogeneity as well as topochemical heterogeneity. Together with other characterization methods, this has been shown as a powerful descriptive route to understand glass functionality and glass structure in a more extended perspective. Even though it is important for the wide relevance of fundamental knowledge of glasses, this is notably important for high-technological glasses and in which bottom-up strategies are necessary to design new glass compositions with straightforward applications.",gnd:4021142-3 gnd:4201275-2
Spatio-temporal expression of nuclear-encoded proteins associated to the plastid-encoded RNA polymerase essential for chloroplast biogenesis in Arabidopsis thaliana L.,"The development of functional chloroplasts originating from undifferentiated proplastids is a complex process that depends on the proper function of the plastid-encoded RNA polymerase (PEP). The PEP complex comprises the plastid-encoded bacteria-like core-proteins αββ ʹβʺ and 12 tightly associated, nuclear-encoded proteins (PAPs; Steiner et al., 2011; Pfalz and Pfannschmidt, 2013). Biochemical analyses suggest expression and assembly of these proteins appears in a development- and/or light-dependent manner, however, this process is far from understood. It, however, represents a bottleneck in chloroplast biogenesis since genetic inactivation of any PAP disturbs the plastid gene expression resulting in an ivory/albino mutant phenotype. This thesis provides a detailed catalogue of the temporal and spatial expression of PAP genes during seedling development and describes novel and unexpected features of PAP localization, particularly with regard to the dual distribution between nucleus and plastid.  Future studies will target mechanisms that control this dual localization and will aim to identify a transcriptional master regulator of the PAPs.

"Relations between seismic signals and reservoir properties of deep gas reservoirs in Northwest-Germany - Wustrow member, Rotliegend","This study tries to find the petrophysical basis for correlations between reservoir properties and seismic signals calibrated with geological information for Wustrow-sediments of the Rotliegend in NW-Germany. A secondary objective consists in explaining the large scatter of permeability for Wustrow reservoir rocks of comparable properties. The correlations were ascertained in the DGMK-project 593-8, for instance to authigenic clay mineral types and permeability. The investigations demonstrate that the differences in seismic signals (amplitude, shape and lateral coherency of seismic traces) are a product of distinct compressional field velocities (from wireline logs) and attenuation processes as in-situ bulk densities are barely varying within the investigated horizon. The regions of different clay mineral authigenesis (illite and chlorite) diverge by their average compressional in-situ speeds. The differences suffice to provoke relevant variations in seismic signals. Total porosity appears not to affect the field wave characteristics distinctly as high void volumes are encountered in the province of high compressional speed. The distinct velocities for rocks of different authigenesis and the subsidiary effect of void volume are ascertained also at plug dimensions. Other rock properties affecting wave characteristics than porosity become thus relevant. Plugs of comparable properties but largely varying compressional ultrasonic velocity are analyzed for textural features which certainly or potentially influence wave characteristics. These features represent, affect or indicate also reservoir quality ...",gnd:4185687-9 gnd:4178544-7 gnd:4414221-3

Mechanical characterisation and constitutive modelling of wrought magnesium sheets exhibiting tension-compression asymmetry,"['Wrought magnesium alloys have emerged as promising candidates for highly loaded structural components in the automobile industry recently, due to their high specific strength and low density. In this work, two aspects of wrought magnesium alloys are studied experimentally and computationally: the mechanism-based modelling of plastic deformation and the crashworthiness assessment of simple structures. A constitutive model was developed to capture the plastic behaviour of wrought magnesium sheets under monotonic loading. Wrought magnesium sheets exhibit a strong and evolving tension compression asymmetry in terms of flow stress and r-value (strain anisotropy parameter). A yield function originally proposed by Cazacu, Plunkett and Barlat in 2006 was extended by introducing a new parameter depending on the plastic multiplier to describe this tension-compression asymmetry and its evolution. The model was applied to two different magnesium wrought alloys, AZ31 (Mg+3%Al+1%Zn) and ZE10 (Mg+1%Zn+0.3%Ce), each produced as rolled sheet and as extruded profile. A series of mechanical tests including uniaxial tensile and compression tests along different orientations, through thickness compression tests, shear tests, and notched bar tests was conducted for characterising the mechanical behaviour under various stress states. Experimental results confirm significantly different plastic deformation behaviour of the two alloys, which were resulted from their respective initial textures. For calibration of the material model, identification of material parameters was accomplished with the experimental data based on an error minimisation scheme. The computational results show that the proposed model captures the tension- compression asymmetry of both alloys. The calibrated model was finally applied to a pure bending simulation. The good agreement between the simulated and the semi-analytically calculated bending moment-curvature diagram demonstrates the predictive capability of the present model for the considered magnesium alloys. Experimental study and numerical simulations were conducted to investigate the plastic buckling and crush behaviour of structural components with hollow rectangular profiles fabricated from the two magnesium alloys. The used modelling approach is justified by balancing achievable accuracy and computational efforts. The performance of the components made by magnesium alloys was evaluated in term of the dissipated specific energy in the crush tests and compared with respective aluminium components. It is revealed that the observed high dissipation of magnesium alloys during crushing is related to the work hardening behaviour in compression.', 'Magnesiumlegierungen sind heutzutage aufgrund der hohen spezifischen Festigkeit und geringen Dichte aussichtsreiche Kandidaten für hochbelastete Strukturbauteile in der Automobilindustrie. In dieser Arbeit werden zwei Aspekte der Eigenschaften von Magnesiumlegierungen werden in dieser Arbeit experimentell und numerisch untersucht: die Mechanismus-basierte Modellierung der plastischen Verformung und die Beurteilung der Kollisionssicherheit von einfachen Strukturen. Zunächst wird Ein Konstitutivmodell zur Beschreibung des mechanischen Verhaltens von Magnesiumblechen unter monotoner Belastung entwickelt. Magnesiumbleche zeigen eine starke und sich mit der Verformung entwickelnde Zug-Druck-Asymmetrie in der Fließspannung und dem R-Wert (Dehnungsanisotropie-Parameter). Eine von Cazacu, Plunkett und Barlat in 2006 vorgeschlagene Fließfunktion wird durch die Einführung der Abhängigkeit eines Parameters vom plastischen Multiplikator zur Beschreibung der Zug-Druck-Asymmetrie und ihrer Evolution erweitert. Das Modell wird auf zwei unterschiedliche Magnesiumlegierungen angewendet: AZ31 (Mg+3%Al+1%Zn) und ZE10 (Mg+1%Zn+0.3%Ce), die jeweils als gewalztes Blech und als extrudiertes Profil hergestellt wurden. Eine Reihe von mechanischen Versuchen wird zur Charakterisierung der mechanischen Eigenschaften unter verschiedenen Spannungszuständen durchgeführt, einschließlich einachsiger Zug- und Druckversuche mit unterschiedlichen Orientierungen, Kompressions-, Scher- und Kerbversuche. Die Versuchsergebnisse zeigen, dass die beiden Magnesiumlegierungen sehr unterschiedliches plastisches Verformungsverhalten aufweisen, das von den jeweiligen Anfangstexturen erklärt wird. Für die Kalibrierung der Parameter des Materialmodells wird ein Fehlerminimierungsschema verwendet. Das kalibrierte Modell erfasst die Zug-Druck-Asymmetrie beider Legierungen. Schließlich wird das Modell in einer reinen Biegesimulation eingesetzt. Die Übereinstimmung zwischen dem simulierte und dem semi-analytisch berechneten Biegemoment-Krümmung Diagramm zeigt die Vorhersagefähigkeit des Modells für die beiden betrachteten Magnesiumlegierungen. Experimentelle Untersuchungen und numerische Simulationen werden zur Voraussage und Beurteilung des plastischen Beulens und des Aufprallverhaltens von rechteckigen Hohlprofilen durchgeführt, die aus den beiden Magnesiumlegierungen hergestellt sind. Der angewandte Modellierungsansatz berücksichtigt den Kompromiss zwischen erreichbarer Genauigkeit und benötigtem Rechenaufwand. Die Leistungsfähigkeit der Bauteile wurde anhand der spezifischen dissipierten Energie ausgewertet und mit entsprechenden Aluminiumbauteilen verglichen. Es zeigt sich, dass die beobachtete hohe Dissipation der Bauteile aus den Magnesiumlegierungen während des Aufpralls durch das Verfestigungsverhalten unter Druck verursacht wird.']",gnd:4168536-2 gnd:1076028772

Aerosols and boundary layer structure over Arctic sea ice based on airborne lidar and dropsonde measurements,"The atmosphere over the Arctic Ocean is strongly influenced by the distribution of sea ice and open water. Leads in the sea ice produce strong convective fluxes of sensible and latent heat and release aerosol particles into the atmosphere. They increase the occurrence of clouds and modify the structure and characteristics of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) and thereby influence the Arctic climate. In the course of this study aircraft measurements were performed over the western Arctic Ocean as part of the campaign PAMARCMIP 2012 of the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research (AWI).

Borehole Breakouts in Transversely Isotropic Posidonia Shale,"Borehole instabilities are frequently encountered when drilling through finely laminated, organic rich shales (Økland and Cook, 1998; Ottesen, 2010; etc.); such instabilities should be avoided to assure a successful exploitation and safe production of the contained unconventional hydrocarbons. Borehole instabilities, such as borehole breakouts or drilling induced tensile fractures, may lead to poor cementing of the borehole annulus, difficulties with recording and interpretation of geophysical logs, low directional control and in the worst case the loss of the well. If these problems are not recognized and expertly remedied, pollution of the groundwater or the emission of gases into the atmosphere can occur since the migration paths of the hydrocarbons in the subsurface are not yet fully understood (e.g., Davies et al., 2014; Zoback et al., 2010).

Average-Case Analyse parametrisierter und probabilistischer Algorithmen,"In both Theoretical Computer Science and practical work it is a disappointing outcome if the considered problem is NP complete. There is almost no hope for an efficient algorithm. However, many approaches have been developed to overcome this barrier: - The study of parameterized complexity allows in many cases the concentration of the explosion of the running time in a given parameter. - The behavior of problems not only in the worst case but also in average cases are studied. Or the data to work with is slightly perturbed. Then the concept of a smoothed analysis gives new insides - Also sometimes the use of randomness in the computing process can help to circumvent some obstacles. - And maybe an approximation is also nearly as good as an optimal solution. All these approaches are well studied on its own, but interactions between them, and the use of multiple approaches together, is a mostly unstudied field of research. In this thesis we study a part of these interactions for some test problems. We show that the reduction rules, given by Gramm et al., for the Clique-Cover problem with high probability not only reduce “yes” instances, but solve them entirely. We also consider the paradigm of bounded search trees, which is widely used for parameterizd problems. We find that the expected running time of a simple bounded search tree algorithm is much lower than the worst case bound for FPT problems Vertex-Cover and d-Hitting-Set. For certain sets of parameter values expected FPT running time for the W[1] and W[2] complete problems Clique and Hitting-Set is achieved, too. Furthermore, we study a simple probabilistic generalization of greedy approximation algorithms. For the Vertex-Cover, Hitting-Set, and the Triangle-Vertex-Deletion problem we find that the probabilistic algorithms we give have a substantially smaller expected approximation ratio than their deterministic equivalents. There is also a trade off: With more time one can expect better solutions.",gnd:4138229-8 gnd:4120591-1

Der Eisenstoffwechsel und seine Regulation in dem marinen Bakterium Dinoroseobacter shibae,"Die Verfügbarkeit von Eisen ist eine der limitierenden Größen für das bakterielle Wachstum im Ozean. Trotz seiner Bedeutung ist nur wenig über die molekularen Mechanismen der Eisenakquise durch marine Bakterien bekannt. Deshalb wurden in dieser Arbeit die molekularen Grundlagen der Eisenaufnahme und seine Regulation für das marine Modellbakterium Dinoroseobacter shibae bestimmt. Durch Wachstums-versuche konnte gezeigt werden, dass D. shibae Eisensulfat, Eisenchlorid, Eisencitrat und Häm als Eisenquelle nutzen kann. Wachstumsversuche mit Transposonmutanten in möglichen Genen für Metall- und Tetrapyrroltransportern identifizierten AfuABC und HmuSTUVR als Eisenaufnahmesysteme. Häm wird über HmuSTUVR und HemB2 aufgenommen. An beiden Prozessen ist das Exb/Ton-System beteiligt. Vitamin B12 wird mittels Fhu/Fep/Fec/BtuCDBA System in die Zelle transportiert. DNA-Array Studien kombiniert mit Proteomanalysen zeigten eine eisenabhängige Expression der Gene genau dieser Eisen- und Hämaufnahmesysteme. Weiterhin wurden Gene und Proteine der Bakteriochlorophyll- und Carotinoidbiosynthese, des Quorum sensing und der Phagenabwehr (CRISPR-Cas) durch Eisenmangel induziert, während der Energiestoffwechsel, die Vitamin B12-biosynthese und die Proteinbiosynthese reduziert gefunden wurden. An diesen Prozessen sind drei Regulatoren (Irr, IscR, RirA) beteiligt, während sich der potentielle Regulator Fur (ferric uptake regulator) als Mur (mangan uptake regulator) identifizieren ließ. Das Mur Regulon wurde teilweise aufgeklärt. Irr reguliert die Expression von iscR und darüber die Eisen-Schwefel-Zentren-Bildung. Irr steuert weiterhin die Bakteriochlorophyll- und Carotinoidbiosynthese sowie Gene der Photosynthese. Weiterhin wird über CtrA-Expressionskontrolle Quorum sensing, die Mobilität, Chemotaxis und Sekretionssysteme durch Irr eisenabhängig gesteuert. Zusammengefasst konnten wesentliche molekulare Grundlagen des Eisenstoffwechsels und seine Genregulation für ein marines Modellbakterium erstmals aufgeklärt werden. ; The access to iron is one major limiting factor of bacterial growth in the ocean. Despite its biological importance only minor information is currently available on the molecular principles underlying iron transport, utilization and corresponding regulation in marine bacteria. Thus, the molecular mechanism and their regulation were elucidated in the framework of this thesis for the marine model bacterium Dinoroseobacter shibae. Growth experiments revealed, that D. shibae can use iron sulfate, chloride and citrate as well as heme as iron sources. Growth experiments using transposon mutants of genes encoding potential metal and tetrapyrrole transporters identified AfuABC and HmuSTUV as iron uptake systems. Heme gets transported by HmuSTUV and HemB2 into the cell. Both processes require the Exb/Ton system. Vitamin B12 enters the cell via the Fhu/Fep/Fec/BtuCDBA system. DNA arrays in combination with proteome analyses identified the iron-dependent expression of corresponding genes. Furthermore, the expression of genes of bacteriochlorophyll and carotinoid biosynthesis, of quorum sensing and the phage defense (CRISPR-cas) were found induced by low iron concentrations. In contrast genes of protein biosynthesis, the energy metabolism and vitamin B12 biosynthesis were found repressed under these conditions. The observed transcriptional regulatory networks involved three (Irr, IscR, RirA) of the four potential transcriptional iron regulators found in D. shibae. The potential Fur (ferric uptake regulator) was identified as Mur (mangan uptake regulator) and its regulon was partially determined. Irr regulated the expression of iscR which in turn controls iron-sulfur-cluster formation. Irr controls also genes of bacteriochlorophyll and carotenoid biosynthesis and other genes of photosynthesis. Furthermore, via an Irr-controlled ctrA expression, genes of quorum sensing, motility, chemotaxis and secretion become iron-regulated. In summary, major molecular principles underlying the iron metabolism and its control in the marine model bacterium D. shibae were elucidated.",gnd:4014095-7 gnd:1189679272
Optimization of waveguide optics for lensless x-ray imaging,"Lensless x-ray imaging is a promising method to determine the three-dimensional structure of material science and biological specimens at the nanoscale. The development of this technique is strongly related to the optimization of x-ray optics since the image formation and object reconstruction depend significantly on the properties of the illumination wave-field. Waveguide optics act as quasi-point sources and enable the spatial and coherent filtering of x-ray beams. Up to now, x-ray waveguides were severely limited in transmission and flux, restricting their use to high-contrast test structures with moderate resolution and long accumulation times. To overcome these limitations, a novel waveguide design with an optimized refractive index profile is presented which significantly minimizes the absorption of the modes propagating inside the waveguide. Experimental results along with simulations show that these two-component planar x-ray waveguides provide small beam cross-sections along with a high photon flux at the exit. By a serial arrangement of two waveguide slices an optimized illumination source has been developed for high-resolution microscopy, as demonstrated in proof-of-concept imaging experiments.",gnd:4162327-7 gnd:4151879-2

High-harmonic generation with Laguerre-Gaussian beams,"High-harmonic generation is a versatile process, for one thing, useful to explore the structure of atoms or molecules during the generation itself and apart from that a source of bright, short, coherent extreme ultraviolet radiation. Thereby the harmonic radiation can be controlled by the shape of the driving laser with respect to its polarization or frequencies. Recent advances show that Laguerre-Gaussian beams, which carry in addition to their spin also orbital angular momentum, can be utilized for high-harmonic generation. In this thesis, we analyze high-harmonic generation with Laguerre-Gaussian beams in the framework of the strong-field approximation and show that this requires both the interaction of a single atom with the driving laser and the macroscopic superposition of all single atom contributions. We first investigate high-harmonic generation with linearly polarized Laguerre-Gaussian beams. There, we show how the orbital angular momentum of the driving laser is transferred to the generated harmonics. Here, we developed vivid photon diagrams to explain the conservation of orbital angular momentum. We then consider phase matching of the generated radiation in order to increase the conversion efficiency. In particular, we analyze the coherence length at different positions in the generating beam. Furthermore, we investigate high-harmonic generation with a pair of counter-rotating circularly polarized Laguerre-Gaussian beams. Here, we derive selection rules that take account of the conservation of energy, spin and orbital angular momentum. In addition, we show that the orbital angular momentum of the generated harmonics can be precisely controlled by the orbital angular momentum of the driving beam.",gnd:4224496-1 gnd:4234583-2
Computational virtual measurement for trees,"National forest inventory (NFI) is a systematic sampling method to collect forest information, including tree parameters, site conditions, and auxiliary data. The sample plot measurement is the key work in NFI. However, compared to the techniques 100 years ago, measuring methods and data-processing (modeling) approaches for NFI sample plots have been improved to a minor extent. The limit was that the newly-developed methods introduced additional validation workflows and would increase the workload in NFI. That was due to that these methods were usually developed based on species-specific and site-specific strategies. In order to overcome these obstacles, the integration of the novel measuring instruments is in urgent need, e.g., light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and the corresponding data processing methods with NFI. Given these situations, this thesis proposed a novel computational virtual measurement (CVM) method for the determination of tree parameters without the need for validation. Primarily, CVM is a physical simulation method and works as a virtual measuring instrument. CVM measures raw data, e.g., LiDAR point clouds and tree models, by the simulation of the physical mechanism of measuring instruments and natural phenomena. Based on the theory of CVM, this thesis is a systematic description of how to develop virtual measuring instruments. The first work is to introduce the CVM theory. CVM is a conceptual and general methodology, which is different from a specific measurement of tree parameters. Then, the feasibility of CVM was tested using a conceptual implementation, i.e., virtual ruler. The development of virtual ruler demonstrated the two key differences between CVM and conventional modeling methods. Firstly, the research focus of CVM is to build an appropriate physical scenario instead of finding a mathematical relationship between modeling results and true values. Secondly, the CVM outputs can approach true values, whereas the modeling results could not. Consequently, in a virtual space, tree parameters are determined by a measuring process without mathematical predictions. Accordingly, the result is free of validation and can be regarded as true values, at least in virtual spaces. With the knowledge from the virtual ruler development, two exceptional implementations are further developed. They are the virtual water displacement (VWD) method and sunlight analysis method. Both of them employ the same CVM workflow, which is firstly measured in reality and secondly measured in virtual space. The VWD aims to virtually measure the point clouds using the simulation of water displacement methods in reality. There are two stages in this method. The first stage is to apply the simulation of water displacement using massive virtual water molecules (VWMs). Some empirical regressions have to be employed in this stage, due to the limitation of computer performance. In the second stage, a single (or few) VWM (or VWMs) is developed to remove those empirical processes in VWD. Finally, VWD can function as a fully automatic method to measure point clouds.The sunlight analysis method aims to virtually measure the tree models using the simulation of solar illumination during daylight. There are also two stages in this method. The first stage is to develop sunlight analysis for a single tree. The second stage is to analyze the interference from neighboring trees. The results include default tree attributes, which can be collected in the future NFI. The successful developments of CVM, along with implementations of VWD and sunlight analysis methods, prove the initial assumptions in this thesis. It is the conversion of mathematical processing of data into virtual measurements. Accordingly, this is a different philosophy, i.e., the role of data is extended to the digital representative of trees. It opens an avenue of data processing using a more natural approach and is expected to be employed in the near future as a standard measuring instrument, such as a diameter tape, in NFI.",gnd:4148259-1 gnd:4075677-4 gnd:4064394-3

Shape constraints in multivariate regression,"In many applications, the objective is to find a meaningful structure in a relationship between dependent and independent variables through a regression kind of model expressed by Y = m(X) + ""; where m is the so called regression function and "" a random error with zero mean. Nowadays, many statistical problems are high-dimensional, since it is easier to collect data and modern computing power allows to consider massive amounts of information. Complex relations are evolved and evaluated more and more. The present thesis tries to answer some questions in this context by proposing new multivariate estimates utilizing shape constraints. Structured relationships in multivariate setups have not been considered in the literature that much probably due to inherent problems like data sparseness. Regression analysis is concerned with fitting a curve to a finite set of points in a space. An estimated regression function enables to predict, evaluate, and interpret a relationship between an explanatory variable and a response variable.

Crack Identification using Dynamic Extended Finite Element Method and Thermal Conductivity Engineering for Nanomaterials,"Identification of flaws in structures is a critical element in the management of maintenance and quality assurance processes in engineering. Nondestructive testing (NDT) techniques based on a wide range of physical principles have been developed and are used in common practice for structural health monitoring. However, basic NDT techniques are usually limited in their ability to provide the accurate information on locations, dimensions and shapes of flaws. One alternative to extract additional information from the results of NDT is to append it with a computational model that provides detailed analysis of the physical process involved and enables the accurate identification of the flaw parameters.

Direct and inverse problems in machine learning : kernel methods and spectral regularization,"We analyze an inverse noisy regression model under random design with the aim of estimating the unknown target function based on a given set of data, drawn according to some unknown probability distribution. Our estimators are all constructed by kernel methods, which depend on  a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space structure using spectral regularization methods. A first main result establishes upper and lower bounds for the rate of convergence under a given source condition assumption, restricting the class of admissible distributions. But since kernel methods scale poorly when massive datasets are involved, we study one example for saving computation time and memory requirements in more detail. We show that Parallelizing spectral algorithms also leads to minimax optimal rates of convergence provided the number of machines is chosen appropriately. We emphasize that so far all estimators depend on the assumed  a-priori smoothness of the target function and on the eigenvalue decay of the kernel covariance operator, which are in…",gnd:4705893-6 gnd:4125161-1 gnd:4193754-5
Towards the investigation of microbe-mineral interaction by means of Raman spectroscopy,"The aim of this doctoral thesis is to gain more information about the interaction processes which take place in nature between the biotic and abiotic components. The ultimate goal is to be able to increase the bioremediation rate by modifying accordingly the factors which influence the bioremediation. To be able to reach this goal, detailed studies focused on biomineralization, biotransformation and biodissolution are required. The influences of various geochemical factors on the microbial communities of an environment, and the response of microorganisms to those factors have to be studied. Furthermore, information regarding the identity of the microorganisms forming the microbial consortium and their role played in the investigated environment is imperatively necessary. Previous investigations have shown that bulk and single cell bacterial identification is doable by means of Raman spectroscopy. In addition, Raman spectroscopy can be used for identification of minerals, organic matter, liquids or gases presented in the rocks. The high sensitivity, the minimal sample preparation and the possibility to investigate minerals instable at atmospheric conditions makes Raman spectroscopy a valuable tool for the investigation of the minerals. The interaction between the biotic and the abiotic components of an iron contaminated aquatic environment was the main topic of this doctoral thesis . The investigation of the bacterial-mineral interactions implies two studies: the influence of the microbial communities on the mineral phases of the pelagic aggregates, and the effect of the geochemical conditions of the aquatic environment on the microbial consortia. In addition to these studies, investigation of biologically mediated iron-rich sedimentary rocks was also performed, emphasizing the potential application of Raman spectroscopy in the field of microbe-mineral interaction.",gnd:4296248-1 gnd:4039226-0 gnd:4176916-8 gnd:4125243-3
Bio-sourced adsorbing poly(2-oxazoline)s mimicking mussel glue proteins for antifouling applications,"Nature developed countless systems for many applications. In maritime environments, several organisms established extra-ordinary mechanisms to attach to surfaces. Over the past years, the scientific interest to employ those mechanisms for coatings and long-lasting adhering materials gained significant attention. This work describes the synthesis of bio-inspired adsorbing copoly(2-oxazoline)s for surface coatings with protein repelling effects, mimicking mussel glue proteins. From a set of methoxy substituted phenyl, benzyl, and cinnamyl acids, 2-oxazoline monomers were synthesized. All synthesized 2-oxazolines were analyzed by FT-IR spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy, and EI mass spectrometry. With those newly synthesized 2-oxazoline monomers and 2-ethyl-2-oxazoline, kinetic studies concerning homo- and copolymerization in a microwave reactor were conducted.

Numerical construction and critical behavior of Kaluza-Klein black holes,"The idea of extra dimensions provides a promising approach to overcome various problems in modern physics. This includes theoretical as well as phenomenological aspects, such as the unification of the fundamental interactions or the hierarchy problem. Based on the seminal works by Kaluza and Klein that were published nearly 100 years ago, we denote theories with at least one compact periodic dimension as Kaluza-Klein theories. From a gravitational point of view the question arises, what are the fundamental solutions to Einstein's field equations of general relativity under these assumptions. In particular, in this work we are concerned with black hole solutions in Kaluza-Klein theory. Considering only the static case without electric charge, it turns out that there is a much richer phase space than in the usual four-dimensional theory, where only the Schwarzschild solution exists. There are at least two types of solutions with a completely different horizon topology: localized black holes with an ordinary spherical horizon and black strings with a horizon that wraps the compact dimension. Several arguments favor the conjecture that the solution branches of both types are connected via a singular topology changing solution that is controlled by the so-called double-cone metric. We study the regime close to this singular transit solution in five and six spacetime dimensions with the help of a highly accurate numerical scheme that we describe in detail. Consequently, for the first time we are able to show that in this regime the black objects exhibit a critical behavior, indicating that physical quantities are governed by universal critical exponents. Interestingly, such exponents were already derived from the double-cone metric. We show that our data confirms these values extremely well. This provides compelling evidence in favor of the double-cone metric as the local model of the transit solution.",gnd:4224278-2 gnd:4053793-6 gnd:4224276-9 gnd:4165788-3 gnd:4013941-4 gnd:4165098-0 gnd:4112491-1 gnd:4148259-1

Some results on finite dimensional modules of current and loop algebras,"In the field of finite dimensional modules of current and loop algebras a lot of research was done and progress was made in the last two decades. Resuming the discussions we showed in the present thesis that Demazure modules are fusion products of ``smaller`` Demazure modules and calculated a decomposition of the fundamental Demazure modules as g-modules. Combining both results we obtained new dimension and character formulas for Demazure modules. As an application we constructed certain affine highest weight modules as the direct limit of fusion products of Demazure modules. We proved that the fundamental Demazure modules are isomorphic to Kirillov-Reshetikhin modules for the current algebra. Furthermore we proved as an analogon in the combinatorial representation theory that the Kirillov-Reshetikhin crystal contains the Demazure crystal. We give a new and elementary proof of the dimension formula of Weyl modules for the loop algebra in the simply laced case. For twisted loop algebras we provide a classification of Weyl modules and proved the analog theorems from the untwisted case, e.g. tensor product structure, dimension and character formulas.",gnd:4309313-9 gnd:4129770-2 gnd:4264242-5
"Symbolic regression for identification, prediction, and control of dynamical systems","In the present work, we use symbolic regression for automated modeling of dynamical systems. Symbolic regression is a powerful and general method suitable for data-driven identification of mathematical expressions. In particular, the structure and parameters of those expressions are identified simultaneously. We consider two main variants of symbolic regression: sparse regression-based and genetic programming-based symbolic regression. Both are applied to identification, prediction and control of dynamical systems. We introduce a new methodology for the data-driven identification of nonlinear dynamics for systems undergoing abrupt changes. Building on a sparse regression algorithm derived earlier, the model after the change is defined as a minimum update with respect to a reference model of the system identified prior to the change. The technique is successfully exemplified on the chaotic Lorenz system and the van der Pol oscillator.

Modellierung der Nahordnung von amorphen Systemen mit Computersimulationen,"Three different amorphous systems have been modelled with the computer simulation methods Monte Carlo (MC) and Reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) in order to determine the intermolecular structure and intermolecular pair potentials. The simulations are based on the total atom pair correlation functions, that have been determined by X-ray (fluid CF4, fluid ethane) and neutron diffraction (molten ZnCl2) experiments at different temperatures and densities. The experimental functions of fluid CF4 have been reproduced in MC simulations with a simple five-center-Lennard-Jones potential. The molecules are statistically distributed and no preferred intermolecular orientation is visible. In addition, the agreement with the RMC results is good. The MC simulations on fluid ethane were performed with an empirically determined modified eight-center-Lennard- Jones-potential. The molecules are also statistically distributed. Furthermore, the angle dependend correlation functions for four special orientations between two neighboured molecules (crossed, T-shaped, parallel adjacent and parallel end-to-end) show, that no preferred orientation exists. The RMC simulations confirm these results. For the MC simulations of molten ZnCl2 a special pair potential was developed, that simulates the polarisation effects with a damped Coulomb function in combination with an oscillating function for the Zn-Zn- interaction. This potential generates density fluctuations in the Zn substructure, that give rise to the prepeak.

Dynamic coronal mass ejection processes and magnetic reconnection,"The Sun is the nearest star to the Earth. It consists of an interior and an atmosphere. The convection zone is the outermost layer of the solar interior. A flux rope may emerge as a coherent structure from the convection zone into the solar atmosphere or be formed by magnetic reconnection in the atmosphere. A flux rope is a bundle of magnetic field lines twisting around an axis field line, creating a helical shape by which dense filament material can be supported against gravity. The flux rope is also considered as the key structure of the most energetic phenomena in the solar system, such as coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and flares.

Ab initio investigations of the intrinsic optical properties of germanium and silicon nanocrystals,"Ab initio calculations of Si and Ge nanocrystals of up to 363 Ge atoms have been carried out. After relaxation, the structure shows an expansion at the center. Structural relaxation is indispensable for the description of the electronic and optical properties. Germanium nanocrystals show much shorter radiative lifetimes than those of silicon, leading to the expectation of applicability to luminescence. The Delta-self-consistent-field method is used to calculate excitation energies within the DFT-LDA framework. Exchange splitting energies between singlet and triplet excitons are likewise calculated, within LSDA. Optical spectra in independent-particle approximation compare rather well with experiment. Alloying and confinement are found to act approximately independently. Embedded crystallites are treated using a special extrapolative version of the linear tetrahedron integration method. Compression is shown to change the character of the crystallites. This can be explained with reference to the bulk band behavior. Stokes shifts are calculated for fixed symmetry. The effect of the symmetry break due to an optical excitation is found to be strong.",gnd:4204530-7 gnd:4165767-6 gnd:4636471-7

"Catastrophic sediment pulses in the Pokhara Valley, Nepal","Fluvial terraces, floodplains, and alluvial fans are the main landforms to store sediments and to decouple hillslopes from eroding mountain rivers. Such low-relief landforms are also preferred locations for humans to settle in otherwise steep and poorly accessible terrain. Abundant water and sediment as essential sources for buildings and infrastructure make these areas amenable places to live at. Yet valley floors are also prone to rare and catastrophic sedimentation that can overload river systems by abruptly increasing the volume of sediment supply, thus causing massive floodplain aggradation, lateral channel instability, and increased flooding. Some valley-fill sediments should thus record these catastrophic sediment pulses, allowing insights into their timing, magnitude, and consequences. This thesis pursues this theme and focuses on a prominent ~150 km2 valley fill in the Pokhara Valley just south of the Annapurna Massif in central Nepal. The Pokhara Valley is conspicuously broad and gentle compared to the surrounding dissected mountain terrain, and is filled with locally more than 70 m of clastic debris. ...",gnd:4169027-8 gnd:4130033-6 gnd:4136552-5 gnd:4121639-8 gnd:4113593-3

Crönert presents a new, automated process that makes it possible to obtain all the fuel properties required for combustion simulation.

Human actuation,"Ever since the conception of the virtual reality headset in 1968, many researchers have argued that the next step in virtual reality is to allow users to not only see and hear, but also feel virtual worlds. One approach is to use mechanical equipment to provide haptic feedback, e.g., robotic arms, exoskeletons and motion platforms. However, the size and the weight of such mechanical equipment tends to be proportional to its target’s size and weight, i.e., providing human-scale haptic feedback requires human-scale equipment, often restricting them to arcades and lab environments. The key idea behind this dissertation is to bypass mechanical equipment by instead leveraging human muscle power. We thus create software systems that orchestrate humans in doing such mechanical labor—this is what we call human actuation.  A potential benefit of such systems is that humans are more generic, flexible, and versatile than machines. This brings a wide range of haptic feedback to modern virtual reality systems. We start with a…",gnd:4128664-9 gnd:4399931-1 gnd:4184494-4
Horizontal vs. vertical tectonics : analysis of large-scale structures related to the deformation history of the Archean Barberton Greenstone Belt,"One of the major unresolved questions in Precambrian geology is the nature of tectonic processes during Earth’s early history and the timing of the transition to modern-style plate tectonics. The Barberton Greenstone Belt (BGB) of South Africa and Eswatini features prominently in this discussion because it represents, along with the Pilbara region of Australia, the prime geological archive of the late Paleoarchean (ca. 3.5-3.2 Ga). This time period may mark the transition from a pre-plate tectonic setting to Phanerozoic-style plate tectonics. The cuspate-lobate geometry of the BGB, together with its general structural make-up (defined by folding style, stratigraphic fill and strain distribution) appears to represent a non-actualistic Archean tectonic style characterized by vertical rather than horizontal displacements, as known from modern plate tectonics. A compilation of geological data from the entire greenstone belt demonstrates its heterogeneity and complex deformation history is compared with own investigations in this work. A critical comparison of suggested tectonic settings to recent observations shows that no pure plate-tectonic scenarios are applicable. The temporal and spatial heterogeneity of deformation, the relative greenstone-down sense of shear along many of its contacts to the adjacent plutons, and the overall synclinal structure of the BGB emphasize a non-plate-tectonic setting dominated by vertical movements. Local subsidence due to folding, tilting and sagging of thick, dense greenstone regions into an incompetent granitoid middle crust during partial convective overturn plausibly explains the rotation of the enormous Onverwacht Anticline, the characteristic folding pattern and the temporally and spatially heterogeneous deformation history of the BGB.",gnd:4059351-4 gnd:4278975-8

Ecosystem transpiration from eddy covariance,"Transpiration is an integral part of the earth system, not only because plant water use is the dominant path by which water flows from the soil to the atmosphere, but also because water loss from leaves is intrinsically connected to CO2 uptake and provides a key link between global carbon and water cycles. Transpiration, while well studied at the scale of plants and leaves, remains difficult to quantify at the ecosystem, regional, and global scales. Differentiating between water vapor which has passed through plants, and is thus biologically controlled, and water vapor which is evaporated from surfaces without active control from plants through stomatal regulation is extremely challenging at the ecosystem scale with heterogeneous landscapes containing diverse plant species accessing soil water reserves at varying depths. One potential solution to characterizing transpiration on broader scales is to use eddy covariance to estimate ecosystem transpiration. Eddy covariance has been widely utilized to measure water, carbon, and energy fluxes, with synthesis initiative such as FLUXNET collating hundreds of sites around the world. However, methods for partitioning the total ecosystem water flux (evapotranspiration, ET) measured by eddy covariance systems into the individual components, i.e. transpiration (T) and abiotic evaporation (E), are needed. The work presented here demonstrates the viability and utility of ecosystem scale estimates of transpiration from eddy covariance datasets via data driven methodologies. Identifying key strengths and uncertainties in the method, such as the uncertainty in the magnitude of transpiration but strength in spatial and temporal patterns, better outlines future directions.",gnd:4189218-5 gnd:4304141-3 gnd:4197017-2
Photoinduced crystallisation of CaF2 from a Na2O/K2O/CaO/CaF2/Al2O3/ZnO/SiO2 glass,"Glasses in the system Na2O/K2O/CaO/CaF2/Al2O3/ZnO/SiO2 show the ability to precipitate nanocrystalline CaF2 in the glass matrix via a surface-controlled crystallisation accompanied by a phase separation. The Al2O3 concentration affects the phase separation in the glass and with decreasing Al2O3 concentration the opacity of the glass decreases and the optical quality is increased. For the development of a new type of photo-thermo-refractive (PTR) glass, the adaptation of the photo-thermo-refractive process was adapted to this glass system by doping with CeO2, Ag2O, SnO2, Sb2O3, KBr and the perfomance of UV exposure and two-stage temperature treatment. The cerium sensitises the glass to UV light due to its electron donor capability. The decomposition of the absorption bands of the core on the basis of a physical model using Gaussian functions results in an envelope of 5 + 2 bands. The low optical basicity of the base glass and additionally strongly reducing melting conditions could not completely shift the Ce3+/Ce4+ redox equilibrium to Ce3+. Antimony has a crucial role as an electron transfer agent in the reduction of the Ag+ to Ag0 in the first heat treatment step. The formation of elemental Ag is photosensitive only in the presence of Sb5+ ions in the glass. In the first heat treatment step, the Ag0 agglomerates in the previously exposed areas. A characteristic yellow coloration occurs due to the silver plasmon resonance. Computer simulations of the Ag-plasmon resonance peak positions based on the Mie theory prove the formation of a complete Ag-AgBr core/shell structure of the particles. The Ag/AgBr particle formation depends on the exposure time and the temperature and act as nucleating centers for the heterogeneous CaF2 crystallisation, which is photosensitive only in the presence of bromide. The volume density of the CaF2 crystalls increases with the exposure time. The CaF2 nanocrystals, which are up to a size of 300 nm in diameter, have an inhomogeneous polycrystalline microstructure which suggests an outward growth from a center. Refractive index changes were generated in the glass on the order of Δn = 10-5 to 10-4.",gnd:4352084-4 gnd:4033215-9 gnd:4157441-2

Dynamics of the rise of magnetic flux tubes in stellar interiors : a numerical study of compressible non-axisymmetric flux tubes,"Solar-like stars maintain their magnetic fields thanks to a dynamo mechanism. The Babcock-Leighton dynamo is one possible dynamo that has the particularity to require magnetic flux tubes. Magnetic flux tubes are assumed to form at the bottom of the convective zone and rise buoyantly to the surface. A delayed dynamo model has been suggested, where the delay accounts for the rise time of the magnetic flux tubes; a time, that has been ignored by former studies. The present thesis aims to study the applicability of the flux tube/Babcock-Leighton dynamo to other stars. To do so, we attempt to constrain the rise time of magnetic flux tubes thanks to the first fully compressible MHD simulations of rising magnetic flux tubes in stratified rotating spherical shells. Such simulations are limited to an unrealistic parameter space, therefore, a scaling relation is required to scale the results to realistic physical regimes. We extended earlier works on 2D scaling relations and derived a general scaling law valid for both 2D and 3D.

Investigations on mobility of carbon colloid supported nanoscale zero-valent iron (nZVI) for groundwater remediation,"Injection of nanoscale zero-valent iron (nZVI) is an innovative technology for in situ installation of a permeable reactive barrier in the subsurface. Zerovalent iron (ZVI) is highly reactive with chlorinated hydrocarbons (CHCs) and renders them into less harmful substances. Application of nZVI instead of granular ZVI can increase rates of dechlorination of CHCs by orders of magnitude, due to its higher surface area. This approach is still difficult to apply due to fast agglomeration and sedimentation of colloidal suspensions of nZVI, which leads to very short transport distances. To overcome this issue of limited mobility, polyanionic stabilisers are added to increase surface charge and stability of suspensions. In field experiments maximum transport distances of a few metres were achieved. A new approach, which is investigated in this thesis, is enhanced mobility of nZVI by a more mobile carrier colloid. The investigated composite material consists of activated carbon, which is loaded with nZVI. In this cumulative thesis, transport characteristics of carbon-colloid supported nZVI (c-nZVI) are investigated. Investigations started with column experiments in 40 cm columns filled with various porous media to investigate on physicochemical influences on transport characteristics. The experimental setup was enlarged to a transport experiment in a 1.2-m-sized two-dimensional aquifer tank experiment, which was filled with granular porous media. Further, a field experiment was performed in a natural aquifer system with a targeted transport distance of 5.3 m. Parallel to these investigations, alternative methods for transport observations were investigated by using noninvasive tomographic methods. Experiments using synchrotron radiation and magnetic resonance (MRI) were performed to investigate in situ transport characteristics in a non-destructive way. Results from column experiments show potentially high mobility under environmental relevant conditions. Addition of mono-and bivalent salts, e.g. more than 0.5 mM/L CaCl2, might decrease mobility. Changes in pH to values below 6 can inhibit mobility at all. Measurements of colloid size show changes in the mean particle size by a factor of ten. Measurements of zeta potential revealed an increase of –62 mV to –82 mV. Results from the 2D-aquifer test system suggest strong particle deposition in the first centimetres and only weak straining in the further travel path and no gravitational influence on particle transport. Straining at the beginning of the travel path in the porous medium was observed with tomographic investigations of transport. MRI experiments revealed similar results to the previous experiments, and observations using synchrotron radiation suggest straining of colloids at pore throats. The potential for high transport distances, which was suggested from laboratory experiments, was confirmed in the field experiment, where the transport distance of 5.3 m was reached by at least 10% of injected nZVI. Altogether, transport distances of the investigated carbon-colloid supported nZVI are higher than published results of traditional nZVI",gnd:4135804-1

A Search for Muon Neutrino to Electron Neutrino Oscillations in the MINOS Experiment,"The centerpiece of the thesis is the search for muon neutrino to electron neutrino oscillations which would indicate a non-zero mixing angle between the first and third neutrino generations, currently the holy grail of neutrino physics.

LEM will now be the basis for MINOS' final results, and will likely keep MINOS at the forefront of this field until it completes its data taking in 2011.

"Stable, conductive, and cost-effective semi-transparent electrodes for organic photovoltaics and beyond","Transparent conductive electrodes (TCEs) are a special class of material, as they are both transparent and conductive. In reality, however, these two important characteristics typically trade-off with one another and thus must be balanced. In terms of the material system, the selection of the TCE with the best performance is essential, which is evaluated by the so-called “figure of merit” (FOM). Hence, researchers have suggested various FOMs to rate the TCEs over the past 50 years. However, a more straightforwardly formulated FOM may help to assess a TCE's potential specifically for photovoltaic applications. Since the requirements for the latter are distinctly different compared to other optoelectronic devices, this thesis is devoted to bridging this gap. A novel and exact FOM is proposed that exclusively quantifies the impact of the TCE on photovoltaic performance. This exact FOM fulfills the aspired requirement of being a normalized, dimensionless, and proportional factor for the potential photovoltaic output power with respect to the Shockley-Queisser limit. Using this FOM, a set of current state-of-the-art semi-transparent electrodes is comprehensively assessed, where the spectral range in which photovoltaic materials operate is an important factor. Based on a comment from a colleague at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, the exact FOM is extended into formulations that allow the assessment of different solar module geometries, including the addition of serial connections and additional metal grids. The thesis also includes a thorough study of the impact of poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) processing conditions on its work function. Various formulations are tested with regard to relative humidity levels, annealing temperatures, and solar cell performance. Finally, literature assessments and strategies for achieving highly conductive PEDOT:PSS TCEs are conducted at the end of the thesis.",gnd:4121476-6 gnd:4745842-2 gnd:4014247-4 gnd:4296822-7 gnd:4618144-1

"Climatic drivers of retrogressive thaw slump activity and resulting sediment and carbon release to the nearshore zone of Herschel Island, Yukon Territory, Canada","The Yukon Coast in Canada is an ice-rich permafrost coast and highly sensitive to changing environmental conditions. Retrogressive thaw slumps are a common thermoerosion feature along this coast, and develop through the thawing of exposed ice-rich permafrost on slopes and removal of accumulating debris.

"Traces, interpolants, and automata : a new approach to automatic software verification","Zusammenfassung: Reliability of software has become vital for our society and the success of our economy. A powerful means that supports the development of reliable software is software verification. Software verification is the task of constructing a mathematical proof that shows the correctness of a program. Manual software verification is error-prone, time consuming, and impractical for large programs. Automatic software verification is a promising technique, but even state-of-the-art verification tools often fail while verifying complex programs.In this thesis, we present a new approach for automatic software verification. Our approach is based on a new view to programs. In this new view, the focus lies not on program states, instead the focus lies on sequences of statements, which we call traces.We view a program as an automaton whose alphabet consists of the program’s statements. Hence each program defines a set of traces. This view allows us to apply automata-theoretic operations on programs. E.g., we can decompose a program, or given a set of traces, we can construct a program for this set of traces.In this thesis we introduce a formalism that enables us to present this connection between programs and sets of traces. Using this formalism we present a new kind of correctness proof for a set of traces. We call such a proof a Floyd-Hoare automaton.We use the theory of nested words to present a new kind of correctness proof for an interprocedural trace. We call such a proof a sequence of nested interpolants. The combination of nested word automata and nested interpolants allow us to apply our new software verification approach also to interprocedural and recursive programs.Furthermore, we demonstrate that we can apply our approach in termination analysis. For termination analysis we consider formal languages over infinite words and consider infinite traces. We present a new kind of termination proof that has two properties with are crucial for us. First, existing methods can be used to construct this kind of termination proof for single traces. Second, this kind of termination proof can be used to show termination for a set of infinite traces. The combination of Büchi automata and this kind of termination proof allows us to apply our new software verification approach also for termination analysis.Moreover, we consider programs that consist of a single while loop. In our new view on programs, these kinds of programs are exactly those that define a  ...",gnd:4135576-3
"Imperial ideals in the Roman west : representation, circulation, power","['""The Roman empire, like all empires, may be seen as a particular configuration of power. Controlled by an interlinked set of central institutions and layered aristocracies, this configuration of power reached its widest extent, deepest penetration, and greatest stability between the late first century BC and early third century AD. One feature of this 250-year period that distinguishes it from the previous two and a half centuries, when the Roman state was creating its overseas empire, was the existence of a single, empire-wide ruler, the emperor, who functioned in part as a unifying symbol for the far-flung territories and widely scattered inhabitants of the Roman world.

"Late quaternary variability of hydrography and weathering inputs on the SW Iberian shelf from clay minerals and the radiogenic isotopes of neodymium, strontium and lead","The radiogenic isotope systems of neodymium (Nd), strontium (Sr) and lead (Pb) have been used in numerous studies throughout the last decades to investigate water mass circulations of the past and present oceans, and to trace changing contributions of detrital material from different source areas. Clay mineral assemblages and clay mineral ratios from the fine fraction of marine sediments have also been used to characterize endmember sources. This thesis focuses on a reconstruction of the late Quaternary hydrographic variability of the flow path of the Mediterranean Outflow Water (MOW) and the changing weathering contributions of the detrital clay-size fraction to the SW Iberian shelf. Mediterranean Outflow Water is characterized by higher temperatures and salinities than other ambient water masses. MOW spreads at water depths between 500 and 1500 m from the Strait of Gibraltar into the eastern North Atlantic and has been a source of salinity for the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation in the North Atlantic. In order to evaluate the hydrographic changes of MOW since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) high-resolution Nd and Pb isotope records of past ambient seawater obtained from authigenic ferromanganese oxyhydroxide coatings of bulk marine sediments from three gravity cores in the Gulf of Cadiz (577 m water depth) and along the Portuguese margin (1 745 m and 1 974 m water depth) were produced. The surface and downcore Nd isotope data from all water depths exhibit only a very small variability close to the present day composition of MOW but do not reflect the present day Nd isotopic stratification of the water column as determined from a nearby open ocean hydrographic station ...",gnd:4134766-3 gnd:4136262-7 gnd:4160492-1
Die Rothschild'schen Gemäldesammlungen in Wien,"[""Emerging from the Jewish ghetto in Frankfurt, the Rothschilds took over in the world of banking in less than 50 years. In 1820, Salomon Rothschild came to Vienna to open a branch of the family banking house. His son Anselm was to make his name in the capital city of the Austrian monarchy not only as a financier but also as an art-collector: he laid the foundation for the significant art collections of the Viennese Rothschilds, which were extended and improved continuously, right through until 1938. The aim of the dissertation (Ph.D.) which was handed in at the University of Vienna in 2001 was to establish the focal point of their extensive collections of paintings. Interest in works by the 17th century Dutch School and the 18th century French School was to weave its way like a leitmotif through the collections over all generations. After Anselm's death in 1874, his sons Albert and Nathaniel von Rothschild significantly expanded their father's art collection and gave the works a prestigious setting by building two Palais in the Fourth District of Vienna. These grand houses were taken on by Albert's sons, Louis and Alphonse, who further enhanced the collections but also extended the range by purchasing works by 19th-century Austrian painters. Whereas the Dutch School was highly appreciated by most titled collectors in Europe since 1630 and was as such present in major aristocratic collections in Vienna (Liechtenstein, Czernin, Schönborn, Harrach), the Rothschilds strongly influenced the market by buying artworks from the French and English Schools. As a result of the analysis the Rothschilds present themselves as true admirers of the fine arts who conferred on a regular basis with art historians and other art lovers and who introduced progressive ways of exhibiting their collections. Whilst competing with some of the finest Austrian collections the members of the family also set new standards in the art world.Another important focus is set on the fate of the collections after the incidents of 1938. The Rothschilds in Vienna lost their entire property including their art compilations to the German state, the latter were for the most part meant to be introduced into Hitler's Museum in Linz. Although the collections were entirely restored after the war an important part was claimed by the Austrian museums when the family proclaimed their wish to take permanent exile in the US.

Multifunktionalität von Niederwäldern in Rheinland-Pfalz : Aspekte des Naturschutzes und des Tourismus,"['Zusammenfassung: According to estimates, there are approximately 160 000 ha of forest in Rheinland-Pfalz the origins of which can be traced back to traditional coppice management. Up until the transition from the 19th to the 20th century, coppice was a widespread form of land use in central European broadleaf forests and represented a considerable potential source of wood. These forests were customarily managed in short rotations (usually a maximum of 40 years). Today, however, the majority these stands are now between 60 and 90 years old as, due to a lack of profitability since the postwar period, they have not been coppiced in the intervening years and have outgrown. As a consequence of the recent increase in the demand for woodfuel, coppice management has become an attractive option once more as a means to produce wood for energy use. Coppice forests are also attributed considerable nature conservation value and a high cultural significance. A resumption of coppice management along traditional lines today is largely inconceivable, however. For this reason, it was deemed necessary to collate new findings pertaining to a modern form of coppice management practised in the context of current forest policy, economic aims and ecological objectives as well as in view of technological advances made in timber harvesting. To this end, numerous studies were undertaken as part of the practice-oriented research project ‘Schutz und Nutzung: Ein Raum-Zeit-Konzept für die multifunktionale Entwicklung der Stockausschlagwälder in Rheinland-Pfalz’ [Protection and use: A space and time concept for the multifunctional development of coppice forests in Rheinland-Pfalz]. The project results served to clarify the political, economic and silvicultural framework conditions for modern coppice management, and its role in nature protection and its potential to contribute to regional tourism were assessed. Core elements of the study presented here are the nature conservation and tourism aspects of coppice management', 'Zusammenfassung: In Rheinland-Pfalz befinden sich nach Schätzungen etwa 160.000 ha Stockausschlagwälder, die in ihrer Entstehung auf die traditionelle Niederwaldbewirtschaftung zurückzuführen sind.

Herkömmlich wurden die Niederwälder in einer kurzen Umtriebszeit (i.d.R. max. 40 Jahre) bewirtschaftet, sind allerdings mittlerweile schwerpunktmäßig zwischen 60 und 90 Jahre alt, da sie aufgrund mangelnder Rentabilität seit den Nachkriegszeiten nicht mehr „auf den Stock gesetzt“ wurden und folglich durchgewachsen sind.

The literature of reconstruction : authentic fiction in the new millennium,"['""The Literature of Reconstruction argues for the term and concept of \'postmillennial reconstruction\' to fill the gap left by the decline of postmodernism and deconstruction as useful cultural and literary categories. Wolfgang Funk shows how this notion emerges from the theoretical and philosophical development that led to the demise of postmodernism by relating it to the idea of \'authenticity\': immediate experience that eludes direct representation. In addition, he provides a clear formal framework with which to identify and classify the features of \'reconstructive literature\' by updating the narratological category of \'metafiction\', originally established in the 1980s. Based on Werner Wolf\'s observation of a \'metareferential turn\' in contemporary arts and media, he illustrates how the specific use of metareference results in a renegotiation of the specific patterns of literary communication and claims that this renegotiation can be profitably described with the concept of \'reconstruction\'. To substantiate this claim, in the second half of the book Funk discusses narrative texts that illustrate this transition from postmodern deconstruction to postmillennial reconstruction. The analyses take in distinguished and prize-winning writers such as Dave Eggers, Julian Barnes, Jennifer Egan and Jasper Fforde.

Spectral fingerprinting : the potential of VNIR-SWIR spectral characteristics for tracing suspended sediment sources,"Current research on runoff and erosion processes, as well as an increasing demand for sustainable watershed management emphasize the need for an improved understanding of sediment dynamics. This involves the accurate assessment of erosion rates and sediment transfer, yield and origin. A variety of methods exist to capture these processes at the catchment scale. Among these, sediment fingerprinting, a technique to trace back the origin of sediment, has attracted increasing attention by the scientific community in recent years. It is a two-step procedure, based on the fundamental assumptions that potential sources of sediment can be reliably discriminated based on a set of characteristic ‘fingerprint’ properties, and that a comparison of source and sediment fingerprints allows to quantify the relative contribution of each source. This thesis aims at further assessing the potential of spectroscopy to assist and improve the sediment fingerprinting technique. Specifically, this work focuses on (1) whether potential sediment sources can be reliably identified based on spectral features (‘fingerprints’), whether (2) these spectral fingerprints permit the quantification of relative source contribution, and whether (3) in situ derived source information is sufficient for this purpose. Furthermore, sediment fingerprinting using spectral information is applied in a study catchment to (4) identify major sources and observe how relative source contributions change between and within individual flood events. And finally, (5) spectral fingerprinting results are compared and combined with simultaneous sediment flux measurements to study sediment origin, transport and storage behaviour. For the sediment fingerprinting approach, soil samples were collected from potential sediment sources within the Isábena catchment, a meso-scale basin in the central Spanish Pyrenees. Undisturbed samples of the upper soil layer were measured in situ using an ASD spectroradiometer and subsequently sampled for measurements in the laboratory. Suspended sediment was sampled automatically by means of ISCO samplers at the catchment as well as at the five major subcatchment outlets during flood events, and stored fine sediment from the channel bed was collected from 14 cross-sections along the main river. Artificial mixtures of known contributions were produced from source soil samples. Then, all source, sediment and mixture samples were dried and spectrally measured in the laboratory. Subsequently, colour coefficients and physically based features with relation to organic carbon, iron oxide, clay content and carbonate, were calculated from all in situ and laboratory spectra. Spectral parameters passing a number of prerequisite tests were submitted to principal component analyses to study natural clustering of samples, discriminant function analyses to observe source differentiation accuracy, and a mixing model for source contribution assessment. In addition, annual as well as flood event based suspended sediment fluxes from the catchment and its subcatchments were calculated from rainfall, water discharge and suspended sediment concentration measurements using rating curves and Quantile Regression Forests. Results of sediment flux monitoring were interpreted individually with respect to storage behaviour, compared to fingerprinting source ascriptions and combined with fingerprinting to assess their joint explanatory potential. In response to the key questions of this work, (1) three source types (land use) and five spatial sources (subcatchments) could be reliably discriminated based on spectral fingerprints. The artificial mixture experiment revealed that while (2) laboratory parameters permitted source contribution assessment, (3) the use of in situ derived information was insufficient. Apparently, high discrimination accuracy does not necessarily imply good quantification results. When applied to suspended sediment samples of the catchment outlet, the spectral fingerprinting approach was able to (4) quantify the major sediment sources: badlands and the Villacarli subcatchment, respectively, were identified as main contributors, which is consistent with field observations and previous studies. Thereby, source contribution was found to vary both, within and between individual flood events. Also sediment flux was found to vary considerably, annually as well as seasonally and on flood event base. Storage was confirmed to play an important role in the sediment dynamics of the studied catchment, whereas floods with lower total sediment yield tend to deposit and floods with higher yield rather remove material from the channel bed. Finally, a comparison of flux measurements with fingerprinting results highlighted the fact that (5) immediate transport from sources to the catchment outlet cannot be assumed. A combination of the two methods revealed different aspects of sediment dynamics that none of the techniques could have uncovered individually. In summary, spectral properties provide a fast, non-destructive, and cost-efficient means to discriminate and quantify sediment sources, whereas, unfortunately, straight-forward in situ collected source information is insufficient for the approach. Mixture modelling using artificial mixtures permits valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of the method and similar experiments are strongly recommended to be performed in the future. Furthermore, a combination of techniques such as e.g. (spectral) sediment fingerprinting and sediment flux monitoring can provide comprehensive understanding of sediment dynamics",gnd:4056138-0 gnd:4180608-6 gnd:4054079-0

The x-ray flashes transform all matter into highly excited plasma states within femtoseconds, while their high spatial and temporal resolution allows the study of fast processes in very small structures. Even imaging of single molecules may be within reach if ultrafast radiation damage can be understood and brought under control. Atomic clusters have proven to be ideal model systems for light-matter interaction studies in all wavelength regimes, being size scalable, easy-to-produce gas phase targets with a simple structure. With FELs, ""single cluster imaging and simultaneous ion spectroscopy"" makes possible experiments under extremely well defined initial conditions, because the size of the cluster and the FEL intensity can be extracted from the scattering images. For the first time large xenon clusters up to micron radius were generated. Their single cluster scattering images were analyzed for cluster morphology and traces of the ultrafast plasma built-up during the femtosecond FEL pulse. The simultaneously measured single cluster ion spectra yield unprecedented insight into the ion dynamics following the interaction. The results will feed both future experimental effort and theoretical modeling.']",gnd:4006617-4 gnd:4455365-1 gnd:4264163-9 gnd:4631207-9 gnd:4190373-0
New concepts for parallel object-relational query processing,"During the last few years, parallel object-relational database management systems have emerged as the leading data management technology on the market. These systems are extensible by user-defined data types and user-defined functionality for the data. This work focuses on the efficient parallel execution of user-defined functionality. The main contributions describe techniques to support data parallelism for user-defined scalar and aggregate functions and intra-function parallelism for the execution of a scalar function on a large object, and a new technology to provide extensibility with regard to new set-oriented database operations that can efficiently implement user-defined functionality in parallel object-relational database management systems",gnd:4391852-9 gnd:4378490-2 gnd:4075860-6 gnd:4534774-8
Understanding Himalayan denudation at the catchment and orogen scale,"Understanding the rates and processes of denudation is key to unraveling the dynamic processes that shape active orogens. This includes decoding the roles of tectonic and climate-driven processes in the long-term evolution of high- mountain landscapes in regions with pronounced tectonic activity and steep climatic and surface-process gradients. Well-constrained denudation rates can be used to address a wide range of geologic problems. In steady-state landscapes, denudation rates are argued to be proportional to tectonic or isostatic uplift rates and provide valuable insight into the tectonic regimes underlying surface denudation. The use of denudation rates based on terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide (TCN) such as 10Beryllium has become a widely-used method to quantify catchment-mean denudation rates. Because such measurements are averaged over timescales of 102 to 105 years, they are not as susceptible to stochastic changes as shorter-term denudation rate estimates (e.g., from suspended sediment measurements) and are therefore considered…",gnd:4219356-4 gnd:4169027-8 gnd:4347197-3 gnd:4265837-8 gnd:4054080-7 gnd:4034348-0 gnd:4015366-6 gnd:4132462-6 gnd:4277253-9 gnd:4336660-0 gnd:4000281-0

Control of Complex Nonlinear Systems with Delay,"This research addresses delay effects in nonlinear systems, which are ubiquitous in various fields of physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, and even in social and economic systems. They may arise as a result of processing times or due to the finite propagation speed of information between the constituents of a complex system. Time delay has two complementary, counterintuitive and almost contradictory facets. On the one hand, delay is able to induce instabilities, bifurcations of periodic and more complicated orbits, multi-stability and chaotic motion. On the other hand, it can suppress instabilities, stabilize unstable stationary or periodic states and may control complex chaotic dynamics. This thesis deals with both aspects, and presents novel fundamental results on the controllability of nonlinear dynamics by time-delayed feedback, as well as applications to lasers, hybrid-mechanical systems, and coupled neural systems.",gnd:4780926-7 gnd:4048971-1 gnd:4126142-2 gnd:4114261-5 gnd:4056693-6

Argumentationslinien in Lehr-Lernkontexten : Potenziale englischer Fachtexte zur Chromatografie und deren hochschuldidaktische Einbindung,"['In the past few years research studies focused on modelling the competencies of teachers’ professional knowledge (see Lowenberg Ball /Thames /Phelps 2008, Woitkowski / Riese / Reinhold 2011). They revealed that pedagogical content knowledge is a predictor of the degree to which learners are cognitively activated in class. Subject matter knowledge (knowledge of the subject and its organizing structures) is herein a moderating variable (a necessary, however, not sufficient condition) (see Baumert /Kunter 2006). Students who do a degree course in teaching chemistry or laboratory and process technology often have problems in deducing the steps of scientific reasoning from the connections of the content. This is often due to insufficient subject matter knowledge (see Düwel / Niethammer 2017). In this thesis, processes of understanding and reasoning of undergraduate student teachers have been investigated when elaborating on a complex technical subject matter and applying this knowledge to didactic problems. As text sources, English textbook texts have been used because they have been proved to be more consistent in their lines of arguments than German textbook texts. This was shown prior to this study. Textbook texts have been analysed on the topics regarding water (see Düwel /Eichhorn /Niethammer 2021), crude oil raffination (see Düwel 2019) and chromatography (see Düwel /Eichhorn /Niethammer 2019). These topics represent the didactic perspectives of substances, processes and analytical methods, respectively. The results of the textbook analyses showed that English textbook texts provide a content structure as would be suitable for teaching scenarios. The research questions aim at investigating the test persons’ increase in knowledge throughout their task-based elaboration process on a complex topic (in this study, it is the separation of a lipophilic mixture of colourants by thin layer chromatography) while using English textbook texts. For answering the research questions, an embedded mixed methods approach was chosen (see Kuckartz 2014; Creswell 2013). This means that a minor quantitive study (quant) was embedded in the major qualitative study (QUAL). The main study is a case study, for which an instructional design for learning in higher education has been developed. Thus, students were guided in their elaboration process and in applying their newly acquired knowledge to content-oriented pedagogical problems. The instructional design focuses on a case providing the framework for working out aspects of the content and didactic aspects for planning a replacement lesson. For controlling other influencing factors such as prior knowledge on the subject matter, on the pedagogical content, in English as well as the learning motivation throughout their learning process, quantitative test instruments for determining personal features (a questionnaire), the English skills (a Ctest), the content knowledge (a single choice test) and the learning motivation (a questionnaire) were applied in the minor quantitative study before, during and at the end of the test persons‘ task-based elaboration process of the instructional design. As a result, the English skills of the test persons turned out to be less of a barrier than their knowledge on the subject matter. This is certainly due to the fact that students of higher education have an upper-intermediate to advanced level of English knowledge, which was also proved in this study by the results of the C-test. Some students who participated in the study had even proficient knowledge of English on a level of native speakers. The Independent work with the English text material has already resulted in an increase in knowledge for most test persons. This increase in knowledge was highest for those test persons whose prior knowledge on the subject matter was highest. However, the connections of the content have only been explained in detail through the prompts given in the instructional design. This shows that the relevant passages of the text have only partly been recognized independently by the test persons. All in all, the increase in knowledge on the subject matter has had a positive impact on the test persons‘ application of their newly acquired knowledge to content-oriented pedagogical problems. Steps of scientific reasoning were better explained and misconceptions of provided student answers were recognized. In conclusion from the point of view of higher education didactics, knowledge resources and learning opportunities for student teachers have to be reconsidered (see Düwel / Niethammer 2017: 420).', 'Forschungsarbeiten der letzten Jahre zur Modellierung des Professionswissens von Lehrkräften haben gezeigt, dass fachdidaktisches Wissen ein Prädiktor dafür ist, wie stark Schülerinnen und Schüler kognitiv aktiviert werden (vgl. Lowenberg Ball /Thames /Phelps 2008, Woitkowski / Riese /Reinhold 2011). Das Fachwissen ist dabei die Moderatorvariable (eine notwendige, aber nicht hinreichende Bedingung) (vgl. Baumert /Kunter 2006). Lehramtsstudierende in den Fächern Chemie und Labor- und Prozesstechnik haben häufig Probleme, Erkenntniswege aus der sachlogischen Struktur der Inhalte abzuleiten, was in einer unzureichenden Durchdringung der Fachinhalte begründet liegt (vgl. Düwel / Niethammer 2017). In der vorliegenden Arbeit werden Verstehensprozesse von Lehramtsstudierenden der höheren Semester bei der Erschließung eines komplexen fachlichen Sachverhaltes und dessen fachdidaktische Verwertung untersucht. Als Wissensquelle werden englische Lehrbuchtexte eingesetzt, weil diese nachweislich weniger lückenhaft in ihren Argumentationslinien sind als deutsche, wie anhand von drei Beispielen zu den Themen Wasser unter dem Stoffaspekt (vgl. Düwel /Eichhorn /Niethammer 2021), Erdölraffination unter dem Verfahrensaspekt (vgl. Düwel 2019) und Chromatografie unter dem Verfahrens- und Analysenaspekt (vgl. Düwel /Eichhorn /Niethammer 2019) gezeigt wurde. Die Darlegung der Begründungszusammenhänge in englischen Lehrbüchern liefert eine didaktische Linienführung, die bereits einen Teil der Inhaltsaufbereitung für den Unterricht ausmacht. Die Forschungsfragen und die damit verbundenen Untersuchungen zielen daher darauf ab, die Stufen der Erkenntnisgewinnung, die Studierende bei der Erschließung der inhaltlichen Zusammenhänge eines komplexen Themas (hier: zur dünnschichtchromatografischen Trennung eines lipophilen Farbstoffgemisches) unter Nutzung englischen Fachtextmaterials durchlaufen, zu erfassen. Zur Operationalisierung der Forschungsfragen wurde ein „Embedded Mixed Methods-Ansatz“ gewählt (vgl. Kuckartz 2014; Creswell 2013). Es wird eine qualitative Studie durchgeführt, in die eine quantitative Teilstudie (quant) eingebettet ist. Die Hauptuntersuchung ist eine Fallstudie, für die ein Lehr-Lernkonzept entwickelt wurde, durch das die Versuchspersonen in ihrem Verstehensprozess und der fachdidaktischen Verwertung ihres neu erworbenen Wissens geleitet wurden. Im Zentrum des Lehr-Lernkonzeptes steht eine Fallsituation, in der alle Rahmenbedingungen für die zu erarbeitenden inhaltlichen und konzeptionellen Aspekte einer zu planenden Vertretungsstunde vorgegeben waren. Da sowohl die fachlichen, fachdidaktischen, englischsprachlichen Vorkenntnisse als auch die aktuelle Lernmotivation einen Einfluss darauf haben, wie gut die Versuchspersonen, die gestellten Aufgaben in dem Lehr-Lernkonzept bewältigen, wurden im quantitativen Teil des Untersuchungsdesigns die personenbezogenen Merkmale wie soziodemografische Faktoren (Fragebogen), englischsprachliche (C-Test) und fachliche Vorkenntnisse (Single-Choice-Fachtest) sowie die Motivation (Fragebogen) der Versuchspersonen (Vpn) vor, während und/oder nach der Bearbeitung der Aufgabenkomplexe im Lehr-Lernkonzept erfasst. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die Englischkenntnisse der Versuchspersonen weniger eine Barriere bei der Erschließung der Fachinhalte darstellen als die fachlichen Voraussetzungen. Dies liegt sicherlich darin begründet, dass die Englischvoraussetzungen von studierenden im fortgeschrittenen Bereich liegen, wie auch die C-Testergebnisse in dieser Fallstudie zeigten. Einige hatten sogar fachkundige Englischkenntnisse auf dem Niveau von Muttersprachlern. Allein die Auseinandersetzung mit dem englischen Textmaterial brachte bei den meisten Versuchspersonen bereits einen Erkenntnisgewinn. Dieser Erkenntnisgewinn war bei den Versuchspersonen am größten, die bereits bessere fachliche Vorkenntnisse zur Thematik hatten. Die bessere Untersetzung der Begründungszusammenhänge erfolgte allerdings erst durch die im Lehr-Lernkonzept integrierten Leitfragen. Das zeigt, dass die relevanten Textpassagen nur z. T. von den Versuchspersonen eigenständig erkannt wurden. Die Zunahme im fachlichen Tiefenverständnis zur Thematik wirkte sich auch auf die fachdidaktische Verwertung und Anwendung des erworbenen Wissens aus. Erkenntniswege wurden besser untersetzt und Schülerfehlkonzepte erkannt. Daraus folgt, dass aus hochschuldidaktischer Sicht zum einen die Wissensquellen und zum anderen die inszenierten Lernanlässe, über die die Auseinandersetzung mit einem Sachverhalt initiiert wird, zu überdenken sind (vgl. Düwel /Niethammer 2017: 420).']",gnd:4014777-0 gnd:4025226-7 gnd:4002899-9 gnd:4035093-9 gnd:4136714-5 gnd:4035408-8 gnd:4010153-8 gnd:4066571-9

Heterogene Sensordatenfusion zur robusten Objektverfolgung im automobilen Straßenverkehr,"['Future driver assistance systems will require not only information about the current state of a vehicle but also a perception and modelling of the environment. Depending on the complexity of the assistance function it will have a variable scale of details. Safety systems - like automatic breaking - have to meet the highest requirements. The geometric as well as the dynamic parameters of potential collision partners have to be calculated as precisely as possible. Because no state-of-the-art sensor device is able to meet the whole variety of requirements, a sensor data fusion of heterogenous sensors is therefore essential. Here the advantages of radar sensors measuring the dynamic properties of objects can be combined with the advantages of optical sensors measuring their geometric dimension. In order to achieve an optimal fusion, however, different aspects have to be considered. Three of those are covered by this thesis and will be presented after a detailed bibliography: The processing of asynchronous sensor data, an improved sensor model for optical sensors in particular, and finally a fusion architecture for a varying observability of the state vector. This thesis will show different possibilities to modify a Kalman filter architecture in order to stabilize object tracking especially when the perspective is changing - which is typical for overtaking manoeuvres. The advantages of the proposed algorithms will be demonstrated on the basis of real sensor data. <engl.>', 'Zukünftige Fahrerassistenzsysteme benötigen neben der Information über den aktuellen Fahrzustand eine Umgebungserfassung und -modellierung.

Phase diagrams of exceptional and supersymmetric lattice gauge theories,"In this work different strongly-coupled gauge theories with and without fundamental matter have been studied on the lattice with an emphasis on the confinement problem and the QCD phase diagram at nonvanishing net baryon density as well as on possible supersymmetric extensions of the standard model of particle physics. In gauge theories with a non-trivial centre symmetry, as for instance SU(3)-Yang-Mills theory, confinement is intimately related to the centre of the gauge group, and the Polyakov loop serves as an order parameter for confinement. In QCD, this centre symmetry is explicitly broken by quarks in the fundamental representation of the gauge group. But still quarks and gluons are confined in mesons, baryons and glueballs at low temperatures and small densities, suggesting that centre symmetry is not responsible for the phenomenon of confinement.",gnd:4297710-1 gnd:4297273-5 gnd:4128082-9
Generalized bounds for convex multistage stochastic programs,"This book investigates convex multistage stochastic programs whose objective and constraint functions exhibit a generalized nonconvex dependence on the random parameters. Although the classical Jensen and Edmundson-Madansky type bounds or its extensions are generally not available for such problems, tight bounds can systematically be constructed under mild regularity conditions. A nice primal-dual symmetry property is revealed when the proposed bounding method is applied to linear stochastic programs. After having developed the theoretical concepts, exemplary real-life applications are studied. It is shown how market power, lognormal stochastic processes, and risk-aversion can be properly handled in a stochastic programming framework. Numerical experiments show that the relative gap between the bounds can be reduced to a few percent without exploding the problem size",gnd:4057625-5 gnd:4124043-1 gnd:4002498-2 gnd:4128130-5
Silicon nanocrystals in various dielectric matrices : structural and optical properties,"Zusammenfassung: AbstractThis dissertation is focused on the fundamental investigation of Si nanocrystals formed in annealed Si rich/stoichiometric dielectric multilayered structures. The films are prepared by size-controlled superlattices approach previously widely applied to SiOx/SiO2 superlattices. While a deep understanding of fundamental properties of Si nanocrystals in SiOx matrix has been already achieved, most of the results published on silicon nanocrystals in SiNx do not represent a clear understanding and sometimes even contradict to each other.Thereby, a starting point of the present research is a detailed study of Si nanocrystals embedded in Si nitride matrix. A careful development of plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition parameters allowed the deposition of optimized SiNx/Si3N4 superlattices of various SiNx thicknesses, which were further annealed in order to form Si nanocrystals of various sizes. Based on transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis, the formation of size-controlled Si nanocrystals of various sizes is confirmed. Despite photoluminescence spectra of these samples demonstrate the expected PL blue shift with the decrease of Si nanocrystal size, the shift is confirmed to be an optical artifact. The results presented here can explain a disagreement of the recent reports published on Si nanocrystals in SiNx matrix by other groups, as the photoluminescence peak shift is sometimes wrongly interpreted as nanocrystal size effect. Additionally, according to the concluded issues, novel hetero-combinations, which contain both silicon nitride and silicon oxide sublayers are proposed and realized. Although SiNx/SiO2 and SiOxNy/Si3N4 hetero-structures might show some benefits in optical and electrical properties compared to the standard SiOx/SiO2 and SiNx/Si3N4 superlattices, they have been only very barely studied previously. In the present work it is shown that high-temperature annealing leads to the destruction of SiNx/SiO2 hetero-superlattice, and Si nanocrystals of uncontrollable sizes irregularly distributed within the film are formed. At the same time SiOxNy/Si3N4 hetero-structure sustains high-temperature annealing and size-controlled Si nanocrystals demonstrate quantum luminescence",gnd:7574326-7
Quantum chemistry and surface hopping dynamics of azobenzenes : free and constrained models,"This cumulative doctoral dissertation, based on three publications, is devoted to the investigation of several aspects of azobenzene molecular switches, with the aid of computational chemistry.

The obtained results are discussed in connection with an experimental study of the thermal cis → trans isomerization of azobenzene derivatives in the presence of gold nanoparticles, which is demonstrated to be greatly accelerated in comparison to the same isomerization reaction in the absence of nanoparticles.

Personalized human-robot interaction based on multimodal perceptual cues,"This thesis work addresses the generation of personalized robot behavior to establish long-term human-robot relationships. Socially interactive robots need the same behaviors and capabilities as humans to interact naturally with humans. One of these capabilities is the perception of multimodal -- verbal, visual, and para-linguistic -- cues, and the other is the display of behavior via speech and body language. Usually, people use these cues about some communicative functions and store relevant data over time. Guided by psychological concepts and ideas, the proposed system in this work personalizes robot behavior based on short-term and long-term memory. The selection of relevant information for personalized robot behavior is of paramount importance. Omitting irrelevant data in each step reduces the information space tremendously and leads to less processing time. This process is based on previous experiences and the current perception of the available information. A mental model for each interlocutor is generated based on the data extracted from each human interaction partner. Personalized robot behavior is generated with three behavioral components - speech, gestures/postures, and facial expressions. A dedicated speech generation system has been implemented, catering to short-term and long-term personalized interactions. Several facial expressions and gestures/postures have been implemented on the robots - Robin and Emah. Experiments with the two humanoid robots have shown promising results for various instances of interaction in an episodic manner. The experiments demonstrated the correct realization of the interaction partner over time. The system proposed has shown improved engagement and long-term fluid relationship between a returning human interaction partner and the robot",gnd:1227263368 gnd:4384600-2 gnd:4114248-2 gnd:4125909-9
Humanitarian aid and natural disasters : a study of selected European countries,"The aim of this dissertation is to investigate which factors are most significant in influencing the provision of humanitarian assistance from European Union’s member states to countries stricken by a sudden natural disaster. This dissertation evaluates three research hypotheses. The first hypothesis identifies domestic politics as the key factor in determining the extent to which a door country provides humanitarian assistance to a disaster- stricken country. The second hypothesis revolves around the idea that ethical considerations pertaining to the magnitude of the natural disaster under investigation are the fundamental factor determining the extent to which a donor country is ready to provide emergency humanitarian aid. Finally, the third hypothesis concentrates on an institutionalist argument whereby the nature of a donor country’s humanitarian mechanism is the key explanatory factor accounting for the degree to which a donor country might provide humanitarian assistance to a country struck by a natural disaster. In order to investigate the three research hypotheses presented above, this dissertation triangulates its empirical findings by employing both quantitative and qualitative techniques. Seven European Union member states are selected as case studies: Demark, France Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom. The empirical findings present a picture whereby the magnitude of a disaster and the humanitarian mechanism of a donor country both play a particularly significant role in influencing the extent to which a government is ready to provide emergency humanitarian assistance to disaster-stricken countries.",gnd:4438965-6 gnd:4041387-1
Observation of ν_μ→ν_e Oscillation in the T2K Experiment,"['In this thesis the author contributes to the analysis of neutrino beam data collected between 2010 and 2013 to identify νμ→νe events at the Super-Kamiokande detector. In particular, the author improves the pion–nucleus interaction uncertainty, which is one of the dominant systematic error sources in T2K neutrino oscillation measurement. In the thesis, the measurement of νμ→νe oscillation in the T2K (Tokai to Kamioka) experiment is presented and a new constraint on δCP is obtained. This measurement and the analysis establish, at greater than 5σ significance, the observation of νμ→νe oscillation for the first time in the world. Combining the T2K νμ→νe oscillation measurement with the latest findings on oscillation parameters including the world average value of θ13 from reactor experiments, the constraint on the value of δCP at the 90% confidence level is obtained.

Experimental studies on polarization correlations in hard x-ray Rayleigh scattering,"This thesis investigates experimentally the elastic scattering of hard x-rays. Combining the novel technologies of a third-generation synchrotron radiation source and a Si(Li) strip detector which acts as a highly efficient x-ray Compton polarimeter allows to measure the linear polarization of the elastically scattered photons for a highly linearly polarized incident beam. Here, such a polarization transfer is considered for the first time in the hard x-ray regime. With a photon energy of 175 keV and gold as scatterer, a highly relativistic regime is chosen where Rayleigh scattering is the only significant elastic scattering contribution. In addition to the polarization of the elastically scattered photons, also the angular distribution is measured. The data are compared to fully relativistic second-order QED calculations. Both observables are well described by these predictions whereas the form factor approximation fails. The simultaneous measurement of angular distribution and polarization allows to identify spurious agreement of the form factor theory in only one observable. At scattering angles around 90°, the assumption that the incident beam is completely linearly polarized is not sufficient to explain the data. The measured linear polarization of the Compton-scattered photons is used to obtain an independent estimate for the incident beam polarization of about 98 % which leads to an agreement between experiment and theory at all measured data points. The significant change introduced by this depolarization of 2 % indicates a strong sensitivity on the polarization of the incident beam. In the present experiment, this sensitivity limits the precision, but on the other hand, it allows a precise reconstruction of the incident beam polarization when the theory is established. Here, such a reconstruction is performed and the result agrees with the 98 % from the Compton polarization, but with a slightly lower uncertainty and with less statistics.",gnd:4177106-0

Government communications in a digital age : a comparative study of online government communications in Germany and Great Britain,"['Just like political parties, governments must adapt to the demands of the digital sphere as their legitimacy is dependent on their ability to communicate decisions to citizens. However, despite abundant research into how the Internet is changing political communications, little is known about how governments use digital technolo-gies to communicate with citizens. There is also little knowledge of how different political systems shape the use of technology in this respect. Therefore, from a comparative perspective this study examines how government organisations in Germany and Great Britain are using websites and social media to interact with citizens and the media on a daily basis. Its empirical approach involves a content analysis of government websites and social media pages and a social network analysis of Twitter networks.

Mechanical behavior of synthetic omphacite aggregates at high temperature and high pressure,"Triaxial compression experiments were performed on the synthesized samples and Fe-bearing clinopyroxenite in a solid medium apparatus at a confining pressure of 0.75 to 2.5 GPa, temperatures 900 to 1175oC, and strain rates between 1.1x10-6 s-1 to 8.5x 10-5 s-1. Samples of calcic compositions deformed at high differential stresses reveal abundant mechanical (100)[001] twins, whereas jadeite aggregates deformed at low differential stress show well developed subgrain boundaries. Combining the mechanical data and observed microstructures for deformed synthetic samples reveal that the deformation of diopside aggregates is controlled by dislocation glide, while the kinetics of dislocation climb controls the deformation of jadeite aggregates. The variation in strength with composition obeys scaling by the dependence of melting temperature and shear modulus on composition. In contrast to climb-controlled deformation, glide-controlled deformation should be insensitive to impurity concentrations.",gnd:4282806-5 gnd:4217961-0 gnd:4278264-8 gnd:4077444-2
Physical and functional interactions of human DNA polymerase α-primase and replication protein A,"DNA polymerase alpha-primase (pol-prim) is a four subunit complex (p180, p68, p58 and p48). Pol-prim is the only enzyme capable to start DNA synthesis de novo. It is evolutionary conserved from yeast to human and each subunit is essential for cell viability. The major role of pol-prim is the initiation of DNA replication at chromosomal origins and in the discontinuous synthesis of Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand of the replication fork. There is a sequence similarity between the p58 primase subunit and the 8 kDa ssDNA binding domain of Pol ß. To determine whether p58 has any similar function, a proteolytically stable domain of human primase CTp58 (G266-S510), containing the Pol ß-like region, was produced. It was shown that primase (p48/p58) and its components p48 and CTp58 bind to M13-ssDNA. Furthermore, it was revealed that the CTp58 binds to oligonucleotides having different length and secondary structures. It was found that CTp58 binding not only depends upon the length but also on the structure of the oligonucleotide. This differential binding behavior with different structured oligonucleotides was further confirmed by primase assays. Moreover, we showed that RPA and primase co-operate in their binding to DNA. It was further found that iron is required for primase binding to DNA. Iron requirement was confirmed by a functional assay, using primase devoid of iron and iron-containing primase. These studies of a newly discovered DNA binding activity of DNA polymerase alpha-primase led us to ask the question about the distribution and regulation of the enzyme complex in human cells. Therefore, GFP-tagged DNA polymerase alpha subunits p180 and p68 were analyzed in living as well as fixed cells. In both cases proteins were localized in the nucleus. Moreover, RPA was also found in a complex with DNA polymerase alpha-primase supporting the physical and functional interactions of DNA polymerase a-primase and primase.",gnd:4150353-3 gnd:4368341-1 gnd:4129960-7 gnd:4170185-9 gnd:4381045-7 gnd:4152470-6 gnd:4371871-1 gnd:4626625-2 gnd:4133456-5 gnd:4472943-1

CPPI strategies and the problem of long-term guarantees,"['Due to the incomplete downside-risk protection possessed by portfolio insurance strategies, we are particularly interested in one of the most classical ones: Constant Proportion Portfolio Insurance (CPPI), and the consequential risk its issuers confront with based on the unfulfilled guarantee. In the thesis we propose a new model for the risky asset dynamic concerning the gap risk, and further loosen the traditional restriction in the CPPI strategies with regard to the non-risky asset, which is constantly assumed to evolve with riskfree rate. The cushion dynamic is under the new framework driven by a bivariate Levy process. The solution to the stochastic differential equation is a generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, with which we derive explicitly the risk measures through stochastic integration.

Anthraquinone based redox-active polymers for organic batteries,"The development of new materials for energy storage systems plays an increasingly important role to compensate the growing demand for portable and flexible electronics. Redox-active organic compounds, in particular polymers, represent promising materials featuring many advantages such as flexibility, light-weight and being environmental friendly. Moreover, organic redox-active polymers can be produced at low temperature procedures from renewable or recycled resources and can be processed utilizing efficient and low-cost techniques (e.g., printing techniques). Anthraquinone-based polymers represent promising redox-active materials for the application in organic batteries or solar-rechargeable electric energy storage systems. The redox potential of anthraquinones can be tailored to the desired potential by straightforward modification of the carbonyl groups to electron donating or accepting groups (i.e., 1,3-dithiol-2-ylidene, N-cyanoimine, N,N-dicyanomethylene and thione group). Furthermore, a good charge-to-mass ratio is obtained due to the two electrons redox behavior, which results in comparably high theoretical capacities from 132 to 207 mAh/g. The introduction of low molar mass polymerizable groups, such as vinyl or ethynyl results in anthraquinone monomers that can be polymerized by straightforward polymerization techniques like free radical and rhodium-catalyzed polymerization, respectively. Lithium-organic batteries using the developed polymers as cathode material show promising charge/discharge behaviors with good cycling stability. The present results contribute to the understanding of the relationship between structure and electrochemical behavior and show new perspectives for the development of polymers with tailor-made redox potentials for novel redox-active materials in organic electronics.",gnd:7735306-7 gnd:4387386-8

On the representation of speaker information in human voices : an adaptation approach,"Apart from being carriers of speech, human voices contain a wealth of social signals, for instance about a speaker’s gender, identity, or age, to name but a few. The present thesis is concerned with the way adaptation modifies the perception of gender and identity information from voices. Adaptation is a mechanism by which neural responses decrease after continuous or repetitive stimulation. It is revealed by transient perceptual aftereffects indicating contrastive coding of simple and complex stimulus properties. The three studies reported here investigate unimodal and crossmodal auditory voice aftereffects of adaptation to unfamiliar and personally familiar speakers. Specifically, study I (Exp. 1) shows that adaptation to unfamiliar voices of female or male speakers biases the perception of voice gender away from the adapting gender: test voices, as created by auditory morphing between male and female voices, are perceived as more male following adaptation to female voices and vice versa. The voice gender aftereffect (VGAE) survived at least a few minutes and suggests the existence of voice detectors tuned to female and male voice quality. The absence of voice aftereffects following adaptation to names (Exp. 2), faces (Exp. 3), or sinusoidal tones matched to F0 of adaptor voices (Exp. 4) further suggests that the VGAE is due to habituation of high-level auditory representations.",gnd:4128128-7 gnd:4034834-9 gnd:4026482-8 gnd:4071781-1 gnd:4057587-1 gnd:4064317-7

Computational Fracture Modeling and Design of Encapsulation-Based Self-Healing Concrete Using XFEM and Cohesive Surface Technique,"Encapsulation-based self-healing concrete (SHC) is the most promising technique for providing a self-healing mechanism to concrete. This is due to its capacity to heal fractures effectively without human interventions, extending the operational life and lowering maintenance costs. The healing mechanism is created by embedding capsules containing the healing agent inside the concrete. The healing agent will be released once the capsules are fractured and the healing occurs in the vicinity of the damaged part. The healing efficiency of the SHC is still not clear and depends on several factors; in the case of microcapsules SHC the fracture of microcapsules is the most important aspect to release the healing agents and hence heal the cracks. This study contributes to verifying the healing efficiency of SHC and the fracture mechanism of the microcapsules. Extended finite element method (XFEM) is a flexible, and powerful discrete crack method that allows crack propagation without the requirement for re-meshing and has been shown high accuracy for modeling fracture in concrete. In this thesis, a computational fracture modeling approach of Encapsulation-based SHC is proposed based on the XFEM and cohesive surface technique (CS) to study the healing efficiency and the potential of fracture and debonding of the microcapsules or the solidified healing agents from the concrete matrix as well. The concrete matrix and a microcapsule shell both are modeled by the XFEM and combined together by CS. The effects of the healed-crack length, the interfacial fracture properties, and microcapsule size on the load carrying capability and fracture pattern of the SHC have been studied. The obtained results are compared to those obtained from the zero thickness cohesive element approach to demonstrate the significant accuracy and the validity of the proposed simulation. The present fracture simulation is developed to study the influence of the capsular clustering on the fracture mechanism by varying the contact surface area of the CS between the microcapsule shell and the concrete matrix. The proposed fracture simulation is expanded to 3D simulations to validate the 2D computational simulations and to estimate the accuracy difference ratio between 2D and 3D simulations. In addition, a proposed design method is developed to design the size of the microcapsules consideration of a sufficient volume of healing agent to heal the expected crack width. This method is based on the configuration of the unit cell (UC), Representative Volume Element (RVE), Periodic Boundary Conditions (PBC), and associated them to the volume fraction (Vf) and the crack width as variables. The proposed microcapsule design is verified through computational fracture simulations.",gnd:4017233-8 gnd:4006111-5 gnd:4169826-5 gnd:4121051-7
Intermediate-range ordering and topochemical heterogeneity in binary and ternary silicate glasses,"The fact that glasses can be synthetically produced and engineered allows plenty of opportunity to control their structure. Even though it may sound simple, the glass formation is controlled by physical-chemical principles and any change in the composition, temperature, cooling rate, processing type, etc. impacts the final material - and consequently its properties. While glasses are considered non-crystalline solids due to the absence of longrange periodicity, they show a regular construction, defined by the short-range and intermediate-range order. Their characteristics are described by the topology, which denotes the basic geometrical arrangement of the structural units and allocation of the atoms. At macroscale, for a glass of the same composition, the structure and properties reveal to be homogeneous, independently of the processing, temperature or precursor material. However, at microscale, the same glass may show a different picture, revealing a topological heterogeneity of a few nanometers. Due to technological limitations, the main difficulty is to directly access this region. There is a consensus that the topological heterogeneity, however, manifests as a significant peak at very low temperatures (about 5 K) or low-frequencies (about 1THz or 33 cm−1) by collective vibrational modes. Since the main model for estimating the phonon contribution to the specific heat in a crystal, the Debye model, does not predict any peak at low temperature and there are no models to describe these manifestations in vitreous materials, usually it is considered an anomaly. This anomalous peak has been called Boson peak. Even though it remains as one of the major debated and unsolved problems of condensed-matter physics, intense investigations in these almost 50 years brought an enormous knowledge about most of its characteristics. In order to access the intermediate-range order and the topochemical heterogeneity of selected binary and ternary glass network formers made by reactive powder sintering process, investigations of the vibrational density of states in the region of the Boson peak has been conducted. Foremost, this study describes that the feature of the Boson peak is governed by topological heterogeneity as well as topochemical heterogeneity. Together with other characterization methods, this has been shown as a powerful descriptive route to understand glass functionality and glass structure in a more extended perspective. Even though it is important for the wide relevance of fundamental knowledge of glasses, this is notably important for high-technological glasses and in which bottom-up strategies are necessary to design new glass compositions with straightforward applications.",gnd:4201275-2 gnd:4021142-3

This applies to both monitoring of aquatic ecosystems and evaluation of the efficiency of drinking and waste water treatment processes. The conventional DOC determination methods consist of on-site sampling and subsequent analysis in a stationary laboratory.

The key features of the portable DOC analyzer are the independ-ence from high-purity gases, catalysts or combustion technology.

Climate governance and urban planning : implementing low-carbon development patterns,"""Urban planning as a discipline is deeply integral to implementing a low-carbon future. This book fosters an understanding for the rules-in-use that govern urban planning and influence the ability to implement low-carbon development patterns. Drawing on the theoretical foundations of the climate governance and urban planning literatures, the book provides a context to understand plan implementation challenges and obstacles in metropolitan areas. A particular planning challenge in metropolitan regions is examined in depth as an example to understand the polycentric nature of taking climate actions: The challenge to implement transit-connected urban centers. As metropolitan regions across the globe seek to reduce emissions from transportation, many levels of governments have developed ambitious climate action plans that make land use and transportation recommendations in order to reduce vehicle miles traveled. Many have recommended low-carbon development patterns which are characterized by intensified and diversified uses around rapid transit stations. However, the implementation of these recommendations is done within the context of different ""rules-in-use"" unique to the planning systems in the metropolitan region. The book examines the rules-in-use around the many actors involved in implementing low-carbon development patterns in three metropolitan regions of similar demographic size. By examining the implementation of low-carbon development patterns, the book focuses on growth management related questions about how to coordinate transit investments with land use decisions in metropolitan regions. The book finds that state legislation that deals with metropolitan planning and regional growth strategies can greatly aid in creating accountability among actors as well as provide a road map to navigate conflicts when implementing low-carbon development patterns. By focusing on the rules-in-use, the book is of interest to policy makers, planners, advocates, and researchers that wish to assess and improve the odds of implementing low-carbon development patterns in a metropolitan region""--",gnd:4182775-2 gnd:4056754-0 gnd:7532090-3 gnd:7547705-1
Discontinuous propagating fronts: linear and nonlinear systems,"The aim of this study is controlling of spurious oscillations developing around discontinuous solutions of both linear and non-linear wave equations or hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs). The equations include both first-order and second-order (wave) hyperbolic systems. In these systems even smooth initial conditions, or smoothly varying source (load) terms could lead to discontinuous propagating solutions (fronts). For the first order hyperbolic PDEs, the concept of central high resolution schemes is integrated with the multiresolution-based adaptation to capture properly both discontinuous propagating fronts and effects of fine-scale responses on those of larger scales in the multiscale manner. This integration leads to using central high resolution schemes on non-uniform grids; however, such simulation is unstable, as the central schemes are originally developed to work properly on uniform cells/grids. Hence, the main concern is stable collaboration of central schemes and multiresoltion-based cell adapters. Regarding central schemes, the considered approaches are: 1) Second order central and central-upwind schemes; 2) Third order central schemes; 3) Third and fourth order central weighted non-oscillatory schemes (central-WENO or CWENO); 4) Piece-wise parabolic methods (PPMs) obtained with two different local stencils. For these methods, corresponding (nonlinear) stability conditions are studied and modified, as well. Based on these stability conditions several limiters are modified/developed as follows: 1) Several second-order limiters with total variation diminishing (TVD) feature, 2) Second-order uniformly high order accurate non-oscillatory (UNO) limiters, 3) Two third-order nonlinear scaling limiters, 4) Two new limiters for PPMs. Numerical results show that adaptive solvers lead to cost-effective computations (e.g., in some 1-D problems, number of adapted grid points are less than 200 points during simulations, while in the uniform-grid case, to have the same accuracy, using of 2049 points is essential). Also, in some cases, it is confirmed that fine scale responses have considerable effects on higher scales.  In numerical simulation of nonlinear first order hyperbolic systems, the two main concerns are: convergence and uniqueness. The former is important due to developing of the spurious oscillations, the numerical dispersion and the numerical dissipation. Convergence in a numerical solution does not guarantee that it is the physical/real one (the uniqueness feature). Indeed, a nonlinear systems can converge to several numerical results (which mathematically all of them are true). In this work, the convergence and uniqueness are directly studied on non-uniform grids/cells by the concepts of local numerical truncation error and numerical entropy production, respectively. Also, both of these concepts have been used for cell/grid adaptations. So, the performance of these concepts is also compared by the multiresolution-based method. Several 1-D and 2-D numerical examples are examined to confirm the efficiency of the adaptive solver. Examples involve problems with convex and non-convex fluxes. In the latter case, due to developing of complex waves, proper capturing of real answers needs more attention. For this purpose, using of method-adaptation seems to be essential (in parallel to the cell/grid adaptation). This new type of adaptation is also performed in the framework of the multiresolution analysis. ...",gnd:4124313-4 gnd:4215427-3 gnd:4044779-0 gnd:4247928-9

For the Hamburg Elbe island Wilhelmsburg, hydraulic and thermal impacts of climate change on the near-surface groundwater are analysed on the basis of numerical models.

"Climate variability and extreme hydro-meteorological events in the Southern Central Andes, NW Argentina","Extreme hydro-meteorological events, such as severe droughts or heavy rainstorms, constitute primary manifestations of climate variability and exert a critical impact on the natural environment and human society. This is particularly true for high-mountain areas, such as the eastern flank of the southern Central Andes of NW Argentina, a region impacted by deep convection processes that form the basis of extreme events, often resulting in floods, a variety of mass movements, and hillslope processes. This region is characterized by pronounced E-W gradients in topography, precipitation, and vegetation cover, spanning low to medium-elevation, humid and densely vegetated areas to high-elevation, arid and sparsely vegetated environments. This strong E-W gradient is mirrored by differences in the efficiency of surface processes, which mobilize and transport large amounts of sediment through the fluvial system, from the steep hillslopes to the intermontane basins and further to the foreland. In a highly sensitive high-mountain environment…",gnd:4591698-6

Hybrid nanolayer architectures for ultrafast acousto-plasmonics in soft matter,"The goal of the presented work is to explore the interaction between gold nanorods (GNRs) and hyper-sound waves.

Multilayer polymer structures with well-defined thicknesses and smooth interfaces were built via layer-by-layer deposition. Anionic polyelectrolytes with Azobenzene side groups (PAzo) were alternated with cationic polymer PAH, for the creation of transducer films.

Lab-on-a-Chip Systeme zur Probenaufbereitung in der patientennahen Labordiagnostik,"Abstract: Fast and reliable detection of infectious pathogens is in many clinical cases decisive for the therapy and prognosis of the patient. Detection methods like PCR are able to meet these requirements. However, to ensure successful amplification and detection, the sample should be purified from inhibiting substances. Since very small sample volumes are used in a PCR run, a previous concentration should also be carried out to achieve a sufficient concentration of the target sequence and thus avoid false negative results. Standard procedures for the preparation of a sample are time-consuming and require many manual steps, a well-equipped microbiological laboratory and well-trained personnel, making them unsuitable for point-of-care-testing (POCT) and resulting in high costs.<br>This work is focused on the development of lab-on-a-chip (LOC) systems, which are capable of performing all steps of sample preparation. The concentration is based on free-flow electrophoresis (FFE) and allows the preparation of both bacteria and viruses. For the first time it could be shown that the concentration of viruses by FFE is possible, larger volumes can be processed in a few minutes and the electrical conductivity of the sample medium is crucial for a fast and efficient concentration. The extraction was carried out by thermal or thermoelectric lysis and on-chip gel electrophoresis for the purification of DNA and RNA. It was shown that bacterial mRNA can be extracted from undiluted EDTA blood in less than three minutes.<br>Since the lab-on-a-chip systems can be used to prepare both bacteria and viruses, their process characteristics and technology enable the rapid preparation of complex sample matrices in the least amount of space and automation of the process can be easily implemented, the systems represent a promising approach for POCT and may help to improve a patient's prognosis in the future",gnd:4232767-2 gnd:7610677-9 gnd:4168396-1
Formulation of Uncertainty Relation Between Error and Disturbance in Quantum Measurement by Using Quantum Estimation Theory,"In this thesis, quantum estimation theory is applied to investigate uncertainty relations between error and disturbance in quantum measurement. The author argues that the best solution for clarifying the attainable bound of the error and disturbance is to invoke the estimation process from the measurement outcomes such as signals from a photodetector in a quantum optical system. The error and disturbance in terms of the Fisher information content have been successfully formulated and provide the upper bound of the accuracy of the estimation. Moreover, the attainable bound of the error and disturbance in quantum measurement has been derived. The obtained bound is determined for the first time by the quantum fluctuations and correlation functions of the observables, which characterize the non-classical fluctuation of the observables. The result provides the upper bound of our knowledge obtained by quantum measurements. The method developed in this thesis will be applied to a broad class of problems related to quantum measurement to build a next-generation clock standard and to successfully detect gravitational waves",gnd:4121608-8 gnd:4169537-9 gnd:4047989-4 gnd:4186957-6
Ground states and spectral properties in quantum field theories,"In this thesis we consider non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics in dipole approximation and study low-energy phenomenons of quantum mechanical systems. We investigate the analytic dependence of the lowest-energy eigenvalue and eigenvector on spectral parameters of the system. In particular we study situations where the ground-state eigenvalue is assumed to be degenerate. In the first situation the eigenspace of a degenerate ground-state eigenvalue is assumed to split up in a specific way in second order formal perturbation theory. We show, using a mild infrared assumption, that the emerging unique ground state and the corresponding ground-state eigenvalue are analytic functions of the coupling constant in a cone with apex at the origin. Secondly we analyse the situation that the degeneracy is protected by a set of symmetries for the considered quantum mechanical system. We prove, in accordance with known results for the non-degenerate situation, that the ground-state eigenvalue and eigenvectors depend analytically on the coupling constant. In order to show these results we extend operator-theoretic renormalization to such degenerate situations. To complement the analyticity results we additionally show that an asymptotic expansion of the ground state and the ground-state eigenvalue exists up to arbitrary order. The infrared assumption needed for the asymptotic expansion is weaker than the usual assumptions required for other methods such as operator theoretic renormalization to be applicable.",gnd:4263274-2 gnd:4401061-8 gnd:4151200-5 gnd:4300046-0 gnd:4116561-5 gnd:4150103-2 gnd:4047982-1 gnd:4128420-3 gnd:4047984-5

Ostrakoden und Foraminiferen aus athalassischen Gewässern und deren Anwendung für die Rekonstruktion quartärer Ökosysteme,"Athalassic waters are characterised by elevated salinity and continental location with full separation from the sea. Faunal assemblages of athalassic waters are individually distinct and characteristic for specific salinity ranges. They are never, however, identical to fully marine assemblages. Athalassic taxa derive from the marginal marine, intertidal zone, where instable ecological conditions require a high adaptability of species. The present thesis identifies, documents and classifies athalassic foraminifer and ostracod associations and applies them for palaeoenvironmental reconstructions. The classification of athalassic waters based on ostracod and foraminifer assemblages needs a specialised methodology because of generally low diversity and high ecological tolerances of typical species, especially towards salinity. Additional methods allow to compensate for this weakness; morphological features as malformations in foraminifer tests as well as noding and sieve pore variability in Cyprideis torosa are applicable for reconstructing salinity changes of the past. Athalassic waters of the low salinity range are characterised by brackish water and tolerant freshwater taxa, dominance of brackish water species, however, is typical for higher salinities. Hypersaline waters are inhabited by a few euryhaline species only, often occurring in very high numbers because of lacking competing species. Some species of marginal marine origin, often associated with salinity-tolerant freshwater species, are typical for athalassic waters, as a generally low diversity as well. If Foraminifera occur, a high proportion of their tests is malformatted. Climatically generated athalassic waters are located in arid climate zones while those with geogenic salinity are typical for humid climate zones because of a high precipitation/evaporation ratio. Hypersaline waters are of climatogenic type and characterised by very low diversity and the exclusive occurrence of euryhaline taxa.",gnd:4170777-1 gnd:4488988-4 gnd:4293663-9

Time-Symmetry Breaking in Turbulent Multi-Particle Dispersion,"This thesis presents experimental and theoretical investigations of the connection between the time asymmetry in the short-time evolution of particle clusters and the intrinsic irreversibility of turbulent flows due to the energy cascade. The term turbulence describes a special state of a continuous medium in which many interacting degrees of freedom are excited. One of the interesting phenomena observed in turbulent flows is their time irreversibility. When milk is stirred into coffee, for example, highly complex and interwoven structures are produced, making the mixing process irreversible. This behavior can be analyzed in more detail by studying the dispersion of particle clusters. Previous experimental and numerical studies on the time asymmetry in two-particle dispersion indicate that particles separate faster backwards than forwards in time, but no conclusive explanation has yet been provided. In this thesis, an experimental study on the short-time behavior of two- and four-particle dispersion in a turbulent water flow between two counter-rotating propellers is presented. A brief but rigorous theoretical analysis reveals that the observed time irreversibility is closely linked to the turbulence energy cascade. Additionally, it is demonstrated experimentally that the addition of minute amounts of polymers to the flow has a significant impact on multi-particle dispersion due to an alteration of the energy cascade",gnd:1148978801 gnd:1076338992 gnd:4117265-6

Hadron Structure in Electroweak Precision Measurements,"['This thesis examines the γZ box contribution to the weak charge of the proton. Here, by combining recent parity-violating electron-deuteron scattering data with our current understanding of parton distribution functions, the author shows that one can limit this model dependence.

Two such cases are discussed in this work, namely, the nucleon’s electromagnetic polarizabilities and quark-hadron duality.

Identification and control of the laser-based synchronization system for the European X-ray Free Electron Laser,"The European X-ray Free-Electron Laser is currently under construction at theDeutsches ElektronenSynchrotron in Hamburg, Germany. This linear accelerator, with a length of 3.4 km,will generate extremely intense and short X-ray laser light pulses with a duration in the femtosecondrange and wavelengths down to 0.05 nm. These laser pulses provide physicists with alight source to take a closer look into small structures on atomic scale.Those precise measurements require timing with an error margin in the femto-second rangefor most subsystems within the facility. Usually, this timing signal is distributed electricallyvia coaxial cables. With the new requirements in timing, this kind of distribution is no longersuitable and a new laser-based synchronization system is used. This system generates a laserpulse train via a master laser oscillator and distributes this via optical fiber to multiple endstationsin the facility.The effective length of the optical path inside the fiber is actively stabilizedby a link stabilizing unit.This thesis analyzes this new system from a control point of view. It is shown that the masterlaser oscillator can be modeled by an integrator, with the H2 norm as the performance criteriaand two filters corresponding to the noise and disturbances of the master laser oscillator itselfas well as the electrical oscillator of the facility. Those influences, as well as the dynamic behaviorof the master laser oscillator, are identified for a laboratory setup. With these models inhand, different controllers are designed and experimentally evaluated. A sufficient controllerperformance can be achieved by a PI controller. However, using a feedback controller witha model-based optimization increase this performance, but these require a high order of thecontroller, which is currently not implementable given the installed hardware.The second part of thiswork analyses the link stabilizing units. This is achievedwith an attachedoptical fiber and a timing measurement by an optical cross correlator. If a short optical fiber isconnected the system can be approximated by a third order system with a time delay of a fewsample. Amodel is identified and used for controller design. It can be shown that a performanceincrease by factor of 4.5 can be achieved if an LQG controller, including a model of the timedelay, is used instead of the previously used PI controller. Moreover, different approaches forlong optical fibers and the operation in the non-linear region of the sensor are shown. Thesecould not be tested in an experiment.The work closes with an analysis of the overall system and gives suggestions of how to increasethe performance of the individual components and of the whole laser-based synchronizationsystem including the attached devices. It will be shown that the optimal performance can beachieved if all systems are connected to the laser-based synchronization system and if the dynamicbehavior of the link stabilizing unit and end-station is equal for all subsystems.",gnd:4257834-6 gnd:4132814-0

Entwicklung und Evaluation eines rotationsinvarianten Texturmodells für die überwachte Bildmustererkennung,"['In this work a new rotation invariant texture model has been systematically developed and evaluated which allows us to distinguish structural features in image patterns intended for supervised pattern recognition. The components ""feature"", ""feature selection"" and ""classifier"" for a pattern recognition system can be selected in such a way as to be as efficient as possible, i.e. so that the quantitative demands for correct classification rates can be fulfilled with a minimum number of features. Two-dimensional ultrasound images show characteristic textures that depend on the imaging technique itself as well as on the tissue under consideration. A texture is the composition of a region of primitive elements -- so called texels -- and their relations to each other. The features of textures are generally described using models, known as texture models. In a study for ""detection of bone edge pixels in two-dimensional ultrasound images"", the classification results of conventional texture features as described by Haralick and Laws were compared to the classification results of features of the rotation invariant texture model. In this study, the features according to Haralick and Laws and those of the rotation invariant texture model were alternately combined with a sequential and a ranking feature selection as well as with a Bayesian and a support vector classificator. The efficiency of the chosen components was rated using image data acquired from a human anatomical specimen. An expert classification of these datasets was given according to the demands of supervised pattern recognition. For the following automatic classification a classification rate of 97% for correctly identifying patterns belonging to class ""tissue"" (specificity ≥ 0.97) and at least 50% for correctly identifying patterns belonging to class ""bone"" (sensitivity > 0.50) was required. The results of the bony structure pixel identification show that a classification based on the features of the rotation invariant texture model has a higher success rate than the features described by Haralick and Laws. Extracting the features of the rotation invariant model is even crucial for achieving the required classification rates, i.e. the required classification rate can only be achieved using the characteristics of the rotation invariant texture model (specificity = 0.971, sensitivity = 0.520). In addition, only a comparatively small number of features are necessary to achieve the demanded classification rate. The quality of the classification can be further improved by increasing the number of used features (specificity = 0.971, sensitivity = 0.633). The effectiveness of the method described for identifying pixels belonging to bony structures was demonstrated by the fact that the proposed classification rate was achieved. Moreover, the small number of necessary features shows the high efficiency of the method as presented here. In a practical setting this reduces the required computational effort and thus leads to a lower computing time for image pattern classification.', 'In der vorliegenden Arbeit wurde ein rotationsinvariantes Texturmodell für eine Unterscheidung struktureller Merkmale in Bildmustern für die überwachte Bildmustererkennung systematisch entwickelt und evaluiert. Es wurde gezeigt, dass die Komponenten: Merkmale, Merkmalsselektionsmethoden und Klassifikator eines Mustererkennungssystems so gewählt werden können, dass dies möglichst ""effizient"" ist, d.h. quantitative Forderungen nach Richtigklassifikationsraten mit einer möglichst geringen Anzahl an Merkmalen erfüllt werden. Zweidimensionale Ultraschallbilder bilden charakteristische Texturen aus, die von der Bildgebung selbst und dem betrachteten Gewebe abhängen. Als Textur wird die Zusammensetzung einer Region aus Texturprimitiven, sogenannten Texeln, und deren Anordnungsregeln bezeichnet. Merkmale von Texturen werden im Allgemeinen über Modelle, sogenannte Texturmodelle beschrieben. Konventionelle Texturmerkmale nach Haralick und Laws wurden den Merkmalen des entwickelten rotationsinvarianten Texturmodells in einer Untersuchung zur ""Erkennung von Knochenkonturpixeln in zweidimensionalen Ultraschallbildern"" gegenübergestellt. Bei dieser Untersuchung wurden Merkmale nach Haralick, Laws und des rotationsinvarianten Texturmodells abwechselnd mit einer sequenziellen und einer rangordnungsbasierten Merkmalsselektion sowie einem Bayes- und einem Support-Vector-Klassifikator kombiniert. Anhand von Bildmustern, die an einem humananatomischen Präparat aufgezeichnet und von einem Experten klassifiziert wurden, ließ sich die Effizienz der ausgewählten Komponenten überprüfen. Gefordert wurde, mindestens eine Richtigklassifikationsrate von 97% für die Muster der Klasse Gewebe (Spezifität ≥ 0,97) und von mindestens 50% für Muster der Klasse Knochen (Sensitivität > 0,50) zu erreichen. Die Ergebnisse bei der Erkennung von Knochenkonturpixeln in Ultraschallbildern haben gezeigt, dass die Klassifikation mit Merkmalen des entwickelten rotationsinvarianten Texturmodells, gegenüber den Methoden nach Haralick und Laws, insgesamt erfolgreicher ist. Die Extraktion von Merkmalen des rotationsinvarianten Texturmodells ist sogar entscheidend für die Erreichbarkeit der Forderungen. Erst durch Merkmale des entwickelten rotationsinvarianten Texturmodells werden die geforderten Klassifikationsraten erreicht (Spezifität = 0,971, Sensitivität = 0,520). Zudem wird nur eine geringe Anzahl von Merkmalen benötigt. Durch Hinzunahme weiterer Merkmale kann eine Klassifikationsrate über die Forderungen hinaus erfolgen (Spezifität = 0,971, Sensitivität = 0,633).

Structures & algorithms in hyperbolic random graphs,"Complex networks are ubiquitous in nature and society. They appear in vastly different domains, for instance as social networks, biological interactions or communication networks. Yet in spite of their different origins, these networks share many structural characteristics. For instance, their degree distribution typically follows a power law. This means that the fraction of vertices of degree k is proportional to k^(−β) for some constant β; making these networks highly inhomogeneous. Furthermore, they also typically have high clustering, meaning that links between two nodes are more likely to appear if they have a neighbor in common. To mathematically study the behavior of such networks, they are often modeled as random graphs. Many of the popular models like inhomogeneous random graphs or Preferential Attachment excel at producing a power law degree distribution. Clustering, on the other hand, is in these models either not present or artificially enforced. Hyperbolic random graphs bridge this gap by assuming an underlying…",gnd:4277661-2

Bridging the gap between precise RT-level power/timing estimation and fast high-level simulation : a method for automatically identifying and characterising combinational macros in synchronous sequential systems at register-transfer level and subsequent executable high-level model generation with respect to non-functional properties,"['This thesis tackles the problem of a fast, yet accurate power and timing estimation of embedded HW modules at a high-level of abstraction. By augmenting an executable high-level model with accurate power and timing information, fast and comprehensive simulations at a high-level of abstraction become possible. Using HLS, a behavioural system description is transformed into a cycle-accurate description at RTL. Combinational macros are identified and characterised automatically, using sophisticated RT-level power models. These provide accurate estimates, while considering as many relevant physical properties and synthesis artefacts as possible. A power and timing annotated high-level simulation model is then generated. This virtual prototype allows a fast, yet accurate estimation of the design. The generated prototype can also be embedded into a virtual system prototype allowing a DSE, far more complex and comprehensive than would be feasible before. Evaluation results show that by having an average relative error per cycle of less than 6.93% and a total error of around 1%, a speed-up of 160x is archived, while giving nearly cycle-accurate estimates. <engl.>', 'Diese Arbeit adressiert das Problem schneller aber dennoch genauer Abschätzungen des zeitlichen Verhaltens eingebetteter HW Module sowie deren Verlustleistung.

"Function spaces of dominating mixed smoothness, Weyl and Bernstein numbers","Function spaces of dominating mixed smoothness were first introduced in the early sixties. Recently, there is an increasing interest in those spaces in information-based complexity and high-dimensional approximation. In this work, on the one hand, we concentrate on studying some further properties of Besov-Triebel-Lizorkin spaces of dominating mixed smoothness such as pointwise multiplication, characterization by mixed differences, and change of variable operators which are connected to numerous applications. On the other hand, we investigate the order of convergence of Weyl and Bernstein numbers of compact embeddings of tensor product Sobolev and Besov spaces into Lebesgue spaces on the unit cube. These quantities belong to the class so-called s-numbers and play an important role in the study of the complexity problems since they are lower bounds for worst-case approximation errors. Our method is based on the wavelet decomposition of Besov-Triebel-Lizorkin spaces of dominating mixed smoothness to reduce the problem to analyzing Weyl and Bernstein numbers in the level of sequence spaces.",gnd:4120913-8
Excitation and superfocusing of the radially polarized conical surface plasmon polaritons,"With our analytical study, we showed the different characteristics of the modes in the tapered region of the fiber based scanning near-field optical (SNOM) tips and their field evolution during the propagation to understand the functionality of the tips. Compared with other types of fiber based SNOM tips, the plasmonic tip, which is a fully metal coated tapered vortex fiber tip, provides an improvement in the field localization at the tip apex and in the conversion efficiency from the far- to near-fields (~ 70%) owing to the superfocusing effect and the resonant coupling process. The superfocusing effect enables the confinement of fields longitudinally and transversally and the enhancement of field amplitude resulting in a strong and highly confined field at the tip apex. We fabricated plasmonic tips by using the vortex fiber, which has double ring cores, and explored experimentally the near-field excitation and detection characteristics of the plasmonic tips. By selectively exciting only the radially polarized fiber mode and analyzing the far-field emission images of the tip apex, we showed that the fundamental radially polarized plasmonic mode, that has the superfocusing capability, is successfully excited. We also probed the plasmonic tip’s apex near-field with an annular grating on a planar gold surface. The results showed that the plasmonic tip excites planar SPPs to all radial directions indicating that the field at the tip apex is longitudinally oscillating along the tip axis. Due to this longitudinal field at the apex, the plasmonic tip also detects the longitudinal field in transmission that has been demonstrated by scanning over tightly focused linearly and radially polarized beams. Lastly, we measured the near-field of fluorescent beads with the plasmonic tip and demonstrated that the tip and the longitudinal plasmonic field at its apex act back on the beads improving the absorption of the fluorescent beads and thus the fluorescence emission.",gnd:4169612-8 gnd:4380320-9 gnd:4182379-5 gnd:4164984-9 gnd:4172251-6 gnd:4154818-8 gnd:4154950-8 gnd:4174992-3
Light-induced transformations in biomembranes,"Cellular membranes constantly experience remodeling, as exemplified by morphological changes during endo- and exocytosis.

The mechanism of the changes in the GUVs’ morphology caused by isomerization of the photosensitive molecules has been previously explored but still remains elusive. We examine the morphological reshaping of GUVs in the presence of the photoswitch o-tetrafluoroazobenzene (F-azo) and show that the mechanism behind the resulting morphological changes involves both an increase in the membrane area and generation of a positive spontaneous curvature.

Dual photo- and thermo-responsive copolymers based on spiropyrans : synthesis and self-assembly into nanostructured materials,"Within the scope of this thesis, various photo-responsive (spiropyran) and thermo-responsive (2-(2-(2-methoxyethoxy) ethoxy) ethyl acrylate or N-isopropylacrylamide) moieties were incorporated with copolymers or block terpolymers, and their dual-responsive behaviour in solution, micellar systems and polymeric membranes investigated. First, dual-responsive copolymers were synthesised using photo-responsive nitrobenzospiropyran acrylate (SPA) with a thermo-responsive moiety, either N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAAm) or 2-(2-(2-methoxyethoxy) ethoxy) ethyl acrylate (TEGA). The copolymerisation of both combinations to form P(NIPAAm-co-SPA) and P(TEGA-co-SPA) is possible by free radical polymerisation thermally initiated with AIBN. A more sophisticated method, nitroxide-mediated polymerisation, was then applied since it permits the formation of well-defined hydrophobic copolymer macroinitiators that are suitable for block extension. This simplified the determination of the degree of polymerisation and enabled the formation of amphiphilic block terpolymers. Upon optimisation, a set of water-soluble copolymers from each thermo-responsive comonomer were prepared. The seven P(NIPAAm-co-SPA) copolymers contained 0 to 5.28 mol% of SPA according to 1H-NMR and an absolute molar mass ranging from 32,000 to 124,000 g/mol. The five P(TEGA-co-SPA) copolymers contained 0 to 16 mol% of SPA and an absolute molar mass 37,000 to 58,000 g/mol. In both cases, the amount of SPA in the monomer mixture is reflected in the final copolymer composition. To investigate the dual responsive behaviour, the copolymers were dissolved in a pH 8 buffer solution, where the best photo-responsive behaviour is observed in the pH-range from 2 to 10. Upon irradiating the copolymers at 340 nm, a change in absorbance at 550 nm indicates the amount of SPA in the zwitterionic merocyanine form increases. This process could be reversed by irradiation at 540 nm and could be repeated at least three times.",gnd:4130524-3
Socializing development : transnational social movement advocacy and the human rights accountability of multilateral development banks,"As multilateral development banks increasingly gained influence in shaping global development, transnational social movements pushed to hold them accountable for their human rights impact towards communities. Leon Valentin Schettler presents a novel causal mechanism of movement advocacy towards MDBs, combining disruptive and conventional tactics. Systematically comparing the evolution of human rights standards and complaint mechanisms over the last three decades, he reveals how the combination of 1) declining US hegemony, 2) counter-mobilization by China and 3) movement cooptation by the World Bank bureaucracy led to a dilution of human rights accountability in the 2010s.",gnd:4152437-8 gnd:4120509-1 gnd:4014957-2 gnd:4074725-6
The spectral and temporal variability of the isolated X-ray pulsar RX J0720.4-3125,"The radio-quiet thermally emitting X-ray pulsar RX J0720.4-3125 belongs to a group of seven isolated neutron stars (often referred to as the ``Magnificent Seven""). They share similar properties such as pure thermal radiation (black body emission with broad absorption features in some cases), long pulse periods 3-12 s) and high magnetic field strengths (B~1e+13 Gauss) on their surfaces. These neutron stars are nearby (<500 pc) and up to a few million years old (i.e. relatively young and still hot), thus, most of them have been identified with dim (25-28 mag) blue optical counterparts. RX J0720.4-3125 is unique among the ``Magnificent Seven"" as it shows long term variations in its spectral properties (temperature, size of the emitting area and equivalent width of the broad absorption feature) and irregularities in the pulse period on time scales of years. The main two theories put forward to explain the behaviour of RX J0720.4-3125 are either free precession or a glitch - a sudden event like a star quake or an impact of a massive object, that released much energy in a short time. In this work, most recent data from new observations with XMM-Newton and Chandra as well as already existing archival data are analysed (altogether now covering a time span of almost twenty years).",gnd:4178319-0 gnd:4273710-2 gnd:4656985-6

Structure and dynamics of amorphous carbonates related to biomineralization : a neutron diffraction study,"Amorphous calcium carbonate(ACC) is a wide spread biological material found in many organisms, such as sea Urchins and mollusks, where it serves as either a precursor phase for the crystalline biominerals or is stabilized and used in the amorphous state. As ACC readily crystallizes, stabilizers such as anions, cations or macromolecules are often present to avoid or delay unwanted crystallization. Furthermore, additives often control the properties of the materials to suit the specific function needed for the organism. E.g. cystoliths in leaves that scatter light to optimize energy uptake from the sun or calcite/aragonite crystals used in protective shells in mussels and gastropods. Lifetime of the amorphous phase is controlled by the kinetic stability against crystallization. This has often been linked to water which plays a role in the mobility of ions and hence the probability of forming crystalline nuclei to initiate crystallization. However, it is unclear how the water molecules are incorporated within the amorphous phase, either as liquid confined in pores, as structural water binding to the ions or as a mixture of both. It is also unclear how this is perturbed when additives are added, especially Mg2+, one the most common additives found in biogenic samples.

Expanding the virosphere : advanced genomic classification,"['The virosphere comprises all known and unknown viruses in our ecosystems. Advanced sequencing technologies in combination with metagenomic analysis have become a key tool for exploring this global diversity of viruses. However, discovery of novel viruses and comparative analyses are often based on small sequence fragments or lack biological context, which restricts a proper classification. In this study advanced genomic methods were used that included comprehensive knowledge of viral genomes along with supporting biological metadata in order to identify and classify viruses at different levels of genetic relationships. In a first example, the genetic background of vaccine-induced rabies cases was revealed by analyzing and comparing the genetic diversity of viral populations. Furthermore, the fundament for a taxonomic reclassification of orthopoxviruses was established on basis of a wide scale genomic analysis. In addition, novel neurotropic mamastroviruses from sheep and cattle were classified as members of a single species that provided evidence of interspecies transmission. Finally, two putative novel species of alphaherpesviruses and orthopoxviruses were identified. These examples are based on field cases that provide substantial corresponding clinical metadata and information of host-pathogen interactions.

Tissue and population-level diversity in plant secondary metabolism : a systematic exploration using MS/MS structural analysis,"Plants are amazing synthetic chemists that create diversified secondary metabolites which play myriad ecological roles for their survival and reproductive fitness in nature. The structural complexity of secondary metabolism has severely hampered its functional analysis. The potential of MS-based metabolomics and of the large-scale acquisition of tandem MS (MS/MS) spectra is limited by the absence of straightforward classification and visualization pipelines so that secondary metabolite and the underlying pathway interpretations can be easily made. From a mechanistic standpoint, secondary metabolism diversity attributes to the occurrence of multiplicity of genes in plant genomes. Yet the majorities of metabolic gene functions remain however unknown. In this thesis, I developed a workflow to systematically explore the diversity of secondary metabolism in Nicotiana attenuata – a metabolically rich ecological model plant. I first characterize the metabolic space of this model plant using the large-scale acquisition of MS/MS spectral information in a data-independent manner and the computational re-assembly of non-redundant MS/MS spectra. The resulting MS signatures were then aligned and visualized to rapidly formulate structural hypotheses. Using natural variation, I examined the correlations among jasmonate signaling and large-scale defense metabolism. The resulting correlation maps uncovered new metabolic layers in a plant’s jasmonate-mediated defensive arsenal. In the tissue-level exploration of secondary metabolite diversity, Transciptomic and metabolomic information and their variance as analyzed by information theory were used for the predictions of tissue-specific function of genes responsible for the metabolic signatures.",gnd:4300564-0 gnd:4207952-4 gnd:4045539-7

Markentreue bei Lebensmitteln : eine Analyse unter Berücksichtigung dynamischer Prozesse am Beispiel von Tiefkühl-Pizza in Deutschland 2000-2008,"['Retail brands are one of food retailing companies most important marketing strategies in order to create an unmistakable profle vis-à-vis competitors. As with manufacturer branded products, the aim is to commit customers to their own company and to establish their own retail chain as a ""true"" brand. The success of this strategy, as with manufacturer branded products, is measured by the concept of brand loyalty of customers. Loyal customers do not switch so quickly to competitors and are also more willing to go along with price increases. Although German retailers spend several hundred million euros each year on marketing their own retail brands, few reliable scientifc fndings are available on how successful private labels are in generating brand loyalty even and especially in comparison to leading manufacturer brands. The present dissertation contributes to close this gap. Frozen pizza is still a leading product of food retailing, which was offered early as a private label and stands in ferce competition to frmly established manufacturers brands. The household panel of the German GfK (Association for Consumer Research) for the years 2000 to 2008 serves as a basis for data. The purchasing behavior towards manufacturers and private labels in the German food retailing sector and its change over time can be determined with the GfK household panel by recording purchases up to the day level of individual households. The present panel contains the frozen pizza purchases of just under 40,000 households, although not all of them spent more than nine years in the panel. Important for empirical analysis is the clarifcation and operationalization of the concept of brand loyalty, which is by no means uniformly defned in research. For food as Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCGs), a defnition of brand loyalty that is limited to the observable act of purchase and that can ignore difcult-to-measure psychological processes is suitable. Unlike older static concepts for measuring brand loyalty, this work draws on recent dynamic methods based on hazard models. Only econometric hazard models allow conclusions to be drawn about interdependencies between the past duration of a repurchase period and the likelihood of brand changes or the continuation of a repurchase period of a particular brand. By including various covariates such as household characteristics important conclusions can be derived for the conception and implementation of marketing policy measures, for example for the planning of price actions. The key fnding of this study is that the cost-intensive marketing strategies of the major food retail chains to make their brands similar to the positive manufacturers brands in customer perception have been broadly successful. The intensity of brand loyalty is no longer signifcantly different between manufacturers and retail brands. Using the example of frozen pizza, this study shows that the major retail chains have succeeded in establishing their brands as ""true"" brands. Intensive marketing eforts by retailers for their private labels are also expected in the future. Like all other empirical studies, the present dissertation also broadly concludes that the infuence of household characteristics or demographic variables on consumer brand choice is neither pronounced nor consistent, or comparatively low.', 'Handelsmarken stellen eine der wichtigsten Marketingstrategien des Lebensmitteleinzelhandels (LEH) dar, um sich gegenüber Konkurrenten ein eigenes unverwechselbares Profl zu schafen. Wie bei Herstellermarken ist es das Ziel, Kunden an das eigene Unternehmen zu binden und die eigene Handelskette als bindungsstarke bzw. „echte“ Marke zu etablieren. Gemessen wird der Erfolg dieser Strategie, wie bei Herstellermarken, durch das Konzept der Markentreue der Kunden. Treue Kunden wechseln nicht so schnell zu Konkurrenten und sind auch eher bereit bei Preiserhöhungen mitzugehen. Obwohl deutsche Handelsketten jährlich mehrere hundert Millionen Euro für das Marketing ihrer Handelsmarken ausgeben, liegen nur wenige belastbare wissenschaftliche Erkenntnisse vor, wie erfolgreich Handelsmarken bei der Generierung von Markentreue auch und gerade im Vergleich zu führenden Herstellermarken sind. Die vorliegende Dissertation leistet einen Beitrag diese Lücke zu schließen. Tiefkühlpizza stellt bis heute ein Leitprodukt des LEH dar, das schon früh als Handelsmarke angeboten worden ist und in scharfem Wettbewerb zu fest etablierten Herstellermarken steht. Als Datengrundlage dient das Haushaltspanel der Gesellschaft für Konsumforschung (GfK) für die Jahre 2000 bis einschließlich 2008. Das Einkaufsverhalten gegenüber Hersteller- und Handelsmarken im deutschen LEH sowie dessen Veränderung im Zeitverlauf lässt sich mit dem GfK-Haushaltspanel durch eine tagesgenaue Erfassung der Käufe bis auf die Ebene der einzelnen Haushalte nachvollziehen. Das vorliegende Panel enthält die Tiefkühlpizzakäufe von knapp 40.000 Haushalten, die allerdings nicht alle über neun Jahre im Panel verweilten. Wichtig für die empirische Analyse ist die Klärung und Operationalisierung des in der Forschung keineswegs einheitlich defnierten Begrifs Markentreue. Für Lebensmittel als Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCGs) eignet sich eine auf den beobachtbaren Kaufakt beschränkte Defnition Markentreue bei Lebensmitteln am Beispiel von Tiefkühl-Pizza von Markentreue, die schwer messbare psychologische Prozesse der emotionalen Bindung an die Marke außer Acht lässt. Im Unterschied zu älteren statischen Konzepten zur Messung von Markentreue greift die vorliegende Arbeit auf jüngere dynamische Verfahren zurück, die auf Hazard-Modellen basieren. Ökonometrische Hazard-Modelle erlauben Rückschlüsse über Interdependenzen zwischen der bisherigen Dauer einer Wiederkaufsperiode auf die Wahrscheinlichkeit von Markenwechseln bzw. der Fortdauer einer Wiederkaufsperiode einer bestimmten Marke. Durch die Einbeziehung verschiedener Kovariablen wie z. B. Haushaltseigenschaften lassen sich darüber hinaus im günstigsten Fall wichtige Schlussfolgerungen für die Konzeption und Durchführung marketingpolitischer Maßnahmen, so beispielsweise für die Planung von Preisaktionen ableiten. Als zentrales Ergebnis dieser Studie lässt sich festhalten, dass die kostenaufwendigen Marketingstrategien der großen LEH-Ketten, mit dem Ziel Handelsmarken den positiv besetzten Herstellermarken in der Kundenwahrnehmung ähnlich zu machen, im Großen und Ganzen erfolgreich waren. Bei der Intensität der Markentreue bzw. in der Treueneigung fnden sich keine merklichen Unterschiede mehr zwischen Hersteller- und Handelsmarken. Die vorliegende Studie belegt am Beispiel von Tiefkühlpizza, dass es den großen Handelsketten gelungen ist, ihre Handelsmarken als „echte“ Marken zu etablieren. Auch für die Zukunft dürften intensive Marketingbemühungen durch den LEH für seine Handelsmarken zu erwarten sein. Wie viele andere empirische Studien auch, kommt die vorliegende Dissertation ebenfalls im Großen und Ganzen zu dem Ergebnis, dass der Einfuss haushaltsstruktureller bzw. demographischer Variablen auf die Markenwahl bei Konsumenten weder ausgeprägt noch konsistent ist bzw. vergleichsweise gering ausfällt.']",gnd:4153776-2 gnd:4073331-2 gnd:4392697-6
Trace gas fluxes from tropical montane forests of Southern Ecuador,"Methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) are major greenhouse gases but their fluxes in tropical montane forests are hardly known. The distribution of known sources of CH4 (e.g. soil wetlands) fail to explain high CH4 concentrations above tropical montane forest canopies that were observed by space-borne measurements. Additionally, there are indications in recent literature that responses of soil N2O and CO2 fluxes to projected increases in nitrogen (N) deposition in tropical forest areas can be predicted from nutrient limitation of vegetation growth. However, nutrient controls on N and C cycling processes have rarely been studied in tropical montane forests. This dissertation tries to elucidate (1) the role of tank bromeliads, growing in canopy wetlands of neotropical montane forests, as a potential source of CH4 that may help to explain the high CH4 concentrations above neotropical forest canopies, (2) nutrient controls on rates of soil N cycling and soil N2O fluxes and (3) nutrient controls on soil respiration in Andean neotropical montane forests of Southern Ecuador ...",gnd:4160159-2 gnd:4438735-0 gnd:4122388-3 gnd:4014573-6
Coupling between Shell and Generalized Beam Theory (GBT) elements,"In the last decades, Finite Element Method has become the main method in statics and dynamics analysis in engineering practice. For current problems, this method provides a faster, more flexible solution than the analytic approach. Prognoses of complex engineer problems that used to be almost impossible to solve are now feasible. Although the finite element method is a robust tool, it leads to new questions about engineering solutions. Among these new problems, it is possible to divide into two major groups: the first group is regarding computer performance; the second one is related to understanding the digital solution. Simultaneously with the development of the finite element method for numerical solutions, a theory between beam theory and shell theory was developed: Generalized Beam Theory, GBT. This theory has not only a systematic and analytical clear presentation of complicated structural problems, but also a compact and elegant calculation approach that can improve computer performance. Regrettably, GBT was not internationally known since the most publications of this theory were written in German, especially in the first years. Only in recent years, GBT has gradually become a fertile research topic, with developments from linear to non-linear analysis. Another reason for the misuse of GBT is the isolated application of the theory. Although recently researches apply finite element method to solve the GBT's problems numerically,  the coupling between finite elements of  GBT and other theories (shell, solid, etc) is not the subject of previous research. Thus, the main goal of this dissertation is the coupling between GBT and shell/membrane elements. Consequently, one achieves the benefits of both sides: the versatility of shell elements with the high performance of GBT elements. Based on the assumptions of GBT, this dissertation presents how the separation of variables leads to two calculation's domains of a beam structure: a cross-section modal analysis and the longitudinal amplification axis. Therefore, there is the possibility of applying the finite element method not only in the cross-section analysis, but also the development for an exact GBT's finite element in the longitudinal direction. For the cross-section analysis, this dissertation presents the solution of the quadratic eigenvalue problem with an original separation between plate and membrane mechanism. Subsequently, one obtains a clearer representation of the deformation mode, as well as a reduced quadratic eigenvalue problem. Concerning the longitudinal direction, this dissertation develops the novel exact elements, based on hyperbolic and trigonometric shape functions. Although these functions do not have trivial expressions, they provide a recursive procedure that allows periodic derivatives to systematise the development of stiffness matrices. Also, these shape functions enable a single-element discretisation of the beam structure and ensure a smooth stress field. From these developments, this dissertation achieves the formulation of its primary objective: the connection of GBT and shell elements in a mixed model. Based on the displacement field, it is possible to define the coupling equations applied in the master-slave method. Therefore, one can model the structural connections and joints with finite shell elements and the structural beams and columns with GBT finite element. As a side effect, the coupling equations limit the displacement field of the shell elements under the assumptions of GBT, in particular in the neighbourhood of the coupling cross-section. Although these side effects are almost unnoticeable in linear analysis, they lead to cumulative errors in non-linear analysis. Therefore, this thesis finishes with the evaluation of the mixed GBT-shell models in non-linear analysis.zeige weniger",gnd:4017233-8 gnd:4145338-4
Topological Microfluidics : Nematic Liquid Crystals and Nematic Colloids in Microfluidic Environment,"This work represents one of the first comprehensive attempts to seamlessly integrate two highly active interdisciplinary domains in soft matter science - microfluidics and liquid crystals (LCs). Motivated by the lack of fundamental experiments, Dr. Sengupta initiated systematic investigation of LC flows at micro scales, gaining new insights that are also suggestive of novel applications. By tailoring the surface anchoring of the LC molecules and the channel dimensions, different topological constraints were controllably introduced within the microfluidic devices. These topological constraints were further manipulated using a flow field, paving the way for Topological Microfluidics.  Harnessing topology on a microfluidic platform, as described in this thesis, opens up capabilities beyond the conventional viscous-dominated microfluidics, promising potential applications in targeted delivery and sorting systems, self-assembled motifs, and novel metamaterial fabrications",gnd:4171428-3 gnd:4803438-1 gnd:4164695-2
A data-driven concept and realization for engineering change management decision support,"In today's automotive industry, quickly reacting to engineering changes and providing market-driven products within a short period remains a competence for all Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). Due to the complexity of products, changes to one component can lead to unexpected chain reactions in others. Besides, from creation to the approval of a change request can take weeks or even months without apparent reasons for the delays. To coordinate and control changes, companies established Engineering Change Management (ECM) processes. ECM processes can impact all determinants of competition of products: cost, quality, and time-to-market. Without proper management of Engineering Changes (ECs), negative impacts will happen. In the scope of this dissertation, a machine-learning based ECM decision support solution is developed which includes two main functions: change impacts prediction and lead time prediction. These functions support engineers to have an overview of change consequences in the early phase of the ECM process. The solution was evaluated based on the data from an automotive company and reached good performance.

Genetic processes in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in the Chernobyl exclusion zone,"As immobile organisms, plants have to tolerate unfavorable environmental conditions and make use of different adaptive mechanisms to survive and reproduce successfully under stress. It is often difficult to detect the organism&rsquo;s or population&rsquo;s response to stress factors due to slow changes of environmental conditions or delayed reactions of plants. From this point of view, the investigation of reactions under extreme environmental change offer unique opportunities to study adaptation mechanisms. Areas with a strong anthropogenic impact on the environment represent ideal places for research on adaptation or selection processes. For many decades, ionizing radiation is well known as a strong damaging and stress factor. Radiation exposure causes heavy damages of the DNA. This leads to a decrease in fitness in the present generation and inheritable mutations which reveal their effects in later generations. On the other hand, radiation exposure activates adaptation processes to ensure survival. The investigation of the influence of radiation at different levels of life organization from the DNA level to the population level can help to elucidate response mechanisms to changing environments. After the accident in 1986 at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, the surrounding territories were contaminated with high amounts of radioactive material. The exclusion zone became a natural laboratory for the investigation of effects of radiation on the biocenosis ...",gnd:4264352-1 gnd:4188986-1
Molekularer Wärmetransport einzelner Moleküle,"['In this work, the heat transfer through single molecules and via the coupling of the thermal near fields between a sample and a probe are experimentally investigated. The measurements are performed under ultrahigh vacuum conditions by means of Near-Field Scanning Thermal Microscope (NSThM), which bases on a commercial scanning tunneling microscope. The probe of the NSThM is augmented by a submicron thermocouple. Its unique structure enables contacting of individual Oktandithiol (ODT) molecules, and thus the determination of an upper limit for the thermal conductivity of an ODT of 53 pW/K. Furthermore, the resulting near-field heat flux between sample and probe is varied by the use of phase transition materials as a sample. However, this effect is dominated by the impact of a residual gas condensation layer on the sample surface. Its influence increases the measured near-field heat flux by a factor of 20, and thus exceeds the values reported in the literature by one order of magnitude. <engl.>', 'In dieser Arbeit wird experimentell der Wärmeübertrag durch einzelne Moleküle sowie durch die Kopplung der thermischen Nahfelder zwischen Probe und Sonde untersucht.

Entwicklung eines iterativen Rekonstruktionsverfahrens für einen Medipix3-Computertomographen,"Zusammenfassung: Currently, many research groups are dealing with the possibilities of further dose reduction in computed tomography. Reconstruction algorithms which are especially suitable for low count statistics (low X-ray doses) offer a great opportunity. Initial applications of an iterative reconstruction method in CT show that dose reductions up to 65% are clinically feasible. An additional reduction of X-Ray dose can be realized by the application of direct converting detector systems which are for example currently used in mammography. Additionally, the application of photon counting detectors (e.g. Medipix3) improve the spatial resolution and image noise.  The aim of this work was to develop an iterative reconstruction algorithm for use with the Medipix3. The starting point was an existing Medipix3 measuring station, which is suitable for tomographic applications.  First two-dimensional measurements showed good temperature stability but also unpredictable fluctuations in the counting rate of individual detector pixels which currently excludes an application of the Medipix3 in combination with silicon in routine medical imaging",gnd:4230463-5 gnd:4022993-2 gnd:4057821-5 gnd:4136102-7 gnd:4123055-3 gnd:4113240-3

Analyzing lakes in the time frequency domain,"The central aim of this thesis is to demonstrate the benefits of innovative frequency-based methods to better explain the variability observed in lake ecosystems. Freshwater ecosystems may be the most threatened part of the hydrosphere. Lake ecosystems are particularly sensitive to changes in climate and land use because they integrate disturbances across their entire catchment. This makes understanding the dynamics of lake ecosystems an intriguing and important research priority. This thesis adds new findings to the baseline knowledge regarding variability in lake ecosystems. It provides a literature-based, data-driven and methodological framework for the investigation of variability and patterns in environmental parameters in the time frequency domain. Observational data often show considerable variability in the environmental parameters of lake ecosystems. This variability is mostly driven by a plethora of periodic and stochastic processes inside and outside the ecosystems. [...]",gnd:4035769-7 gnd:4293663-9
One-dimensional plasmonic nanostructures prepared by template synthetic method for surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS),"['To obtain sensitive and reproducible surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectra, nanostructured substrates with high density and uniform distribution of hot-spots are fabricated by a template synthetic method using a porous anodic aluminum oxide (AAO). Porous Au nanorod arrays are prepared and they show a higher SERS intensity than that of solid structures due to the synergetic effect of hot-spots. Ag nanobranches are not only promising as a SERS substrate itself but also essential for loading a large amount of Au nanoparticles with a uniform distribution resulting in multiple plasmonic couplings and long-term stability in air. Polymer core-metal shell structures are synthesized by infiltrating polymers in the pores and a subsequent metal sputter deposition as cost-effective SERS substrates.

Mapping vegetation types in a savanna ecosystem in Namibia : concepts for integrated land cover assessments,"The characterisation and evaluation of biodiversity and land-cover in Southern Africa&rsquo;s Savannas is a major prerequisite for suitable and sustainable land management and conservation purposes. However, mechanisms for frequent update of the status and trends of biodiversity and land change processes are still missing.

Expression of stem cell marker genes in canine prostate cancer cell lines as basis for the development of molecular therapeutic tools,"Canines Prostata Karzinom, CSC, Suspension System. - Prostate carcinoma is the most frequent cancer affecting men worldwide. Because aggressive carcinomas, characterized by metastasis and recurrence, are difficult to treat and eventually lead to death, new strategies for curative therapies are sought. The dog is the only animal that spontaneously develops prostate cancer, a fact that has drawn more and more attention to the possible use of this canine disease as a naturally occurring animal model for human prostate cancer. Moreover, the canine tumor resembles very much the aggressive, metastatic prostate carcinoma in man in the sense that both are castration-resistant, tend to metastasize early and predominantly to the skeleton and are thought to be derived from the basal layers of the prostatic epithelium. Like in various other cancer types, cancer stem cells or tumor-initiating cells, respectively, are thought to play a pivotal role in tumor initiation, progression, metastasis and therapy resistance. For prostate carcinoma, their existence has been proven for man, but hitherto not in the dog. In the presented thesis, several cell lines derived from benign as well as malignant canine prostate neoplasias were investigated with regard to possible stem-cell like properties, such as expression of certain surface antigens and genes thought to be potential markers of CSC. The cell lines investigated were: CT1258, established from a canine prostate adenocarcinoma, two derivatives of this line stably transfected with either an expression vector encoding for EGFP or EGFP-HMGA2 fusion protein, DT08/40 from a transitional cell carcinoma of the prostate and DT08/46 from a prostate cyst. Markers analysed by flow cytometry, PCR and qPCR, respectively, were CD34, CD44, CD133, C-KIT, ITGA6, C-MYC, NANOG, DDX5, KLF4, SOX2, MELK and OCT4. Moreover, cultivated CT1258 cells were transferred to serum-free culture conditions in order to enrich cells able to grow in spherical form, a typical property of CSCs. Spheroid cells were then analyzed for gene expression profiles and surface antigens mentioned above in comparison to the parental, adherent cells. Whereas CD44 was strongly expressed in all cell lines analyzed, only weak expression of CD133 could be demonstrated in the two transfected cell lines, but neither in the parental line CT1258 nor in the two other lines. Weak expression of ITGA6, MELK and DDX5 was found in almost all cell lines, with the exception of the transfected lines, where expression was very weak. This was also the case for OCT4 in all lines. Comparison of adherent and spheroid cells revealed a tendency to lower expression of all markers in the spheroidal cells, with the exception of ITGA6, which was distinctly higher in the spheroids. In conclusion, a characteristic marker expression profile was found for each analyzed cell line. Also, spheres could successfully be generated from the prostate carcinoma cell line CT1258. Comparison of the markers between adherent and spheroidal cells showed different expression of ITGA6 and C-MYC. The description of the analyzed genes shows a characteristic pattern for each cell line and also the presence of a specifically enriched cell population in the spheroidal cells, which might be indicative of the presence of cancer stem cells.",gnd:4140660-6 gnd:4231928-6 gnd:4047511-6 gnd:4026181-5 gnd:4665329-6

Topological States on Interfaces Protected by Symmetry,"In this book, the author theoretically studies two aspects of topological states. First, novel states arising from hybridizing surface states of topological insulators are theoretically introduced. As a remarkable example, the author shows the existence of gapless interface states at the interface between two different topological insulators, which belong to the same topological phase. While such interface states are usually gapped due to hybridization, the author proves that the interface states are in fact gapless when the two topological insulators have opposite chiralities. This is the first time that gapless topological novel interface states protected by mirror symmetry have been proposed. Second, the author studies the Weyl semimetal phase in thin topological insulators subjected to a magnetic field.

Pulse-shaping strategies in short-pulse fiber amplifiers,"Ultrashort pulse lasers are an important tool in scientific and industrial applications. However, many applications are demanding higher average powers from these ultrashort pulse sources. This can be achieved by combining direct diode pumping with novel gain media designs. In particular, ultrashort pulse fiber lasers are now delivering average powers in the kW range. However, the design of fiber lasers, producing pulses with high peak-powers, is challenging due to the impact of nonlinear effects. To significantly reduce these detrimental effects in ultrashort pulse fiber amplifers, the combination of chirped pulse amplification (CPA) and large mode area fibers is employed. Using these methods, the pulse energy of fiber lasers has been steadily increasing for the past few years. Recently, a fiber-based CPA-system has been demonstrated which produces pulse energies of around 1 mJ. However, both the stretching and the enlargement of the mode area are limited, and therefore, the impact of nonlinearity is still noticed in systems employing such devices. The aim of this thesis is the analysis of CPA-systems operated beyond the conventional nonlinear limit, which corresponds to accumulated nonlinear phase-shifts around 1 rad. This includes a detailed discussion of the influence of the nonlinear effect self-phase modulation on the output pulse of CPA-systems. An analytical model is presented. Emphasis is placed on the design of novel concepts to control the impact of self-phase modulation. Pulse-shaping is regarded as a powerful tool to accomplish this goal. Novel methods to control the impact of SPM are experimentally demonstrated. The design of these concepts is based on the theoretical findings. Both amplitude- and phase-shaping are studied. Model-based phase-shaping is implemented in a state-of-the-art fiber CPA-system. The influence of the polarization state is also highlighted. Additionally, existing techniques and recent advances are put into context.",gnd:4363084-4 gnd:4176343-9 gnd:4222151-1

Borehole Breakouts in Transversely Isotropic Posidonia Shale,"Borehole instabilities are frequently encountered when drilling through finely laminated, organic rich shales (Økland and Cook, 1998; Ottesen, 2010; etc.); such instabilities should be avoided to assure a successful exploitation and safe production of the contained unconventional hydrocarbons. Borehole instabilities, such as borehole breakouts or drilling induced tensile fractures, may lead to poor cementing of the borehole annulus, difficulties with recording and interpretation of geophysical logs, low directional control and in the worst case the loss of the well. If these problems are not recognized and expertly remedied, pollution of the groundwater or the emission of gases into the atmosphere can occur since the migration paths of the hydrocarbons in the subsurface are not yet fully understood (e.g., Davies et al., 2014; Zoback et al., 2010).

Lateral root development in response to local supplies of different nitrogen forms,"['Ammonium, Auxin , AMT1;3, P-type ATPase, Apoplastic acidification, Auxin diffusion, Auxinprotonation, Auxintransporter, PIN2, PIN4', 'This study explains how local ammonium triggers LR branching via modulating PIN-mediated polar auxin transport and pH-dependent radial auxin diffusion. Localized ammonium supply represses PIN2 expression and up-regulates PIN4 expression in LR tips, which promotes shoot-to-root auxin transport and leads to auxin accumulation in the vasculature of the LR branching zone. This process generates an auxin source for subsequent auxin diffusion. Meanwhile, proton release as a consequence of AMT1;3-mediated ammonium uptake leads to apoplastic acidification, auxin protonation and enhanced radial auxin diffusion, directing auxin from the vasculature to outer cell layers. The influence of local ammonium on auxin distribution synergistically stimulates LR emergence, shaping a highly branching root system. The present study lays a new basis to understand how localized N availability modulates auxin distribution in plants and subsequently reprograms LR development to alter root system architecture in a changing environment.', 'Ammonium, Auxin , AMT1;3, P-type ATPase, apoplastische Ansäuerung, Auxindiffusion, Auxinprotonierung, Auxintransport, PIN2, PIN4', 'Diese Studie zeigt, wie ein lokales Ammoniumangebot die Lateralwurzelverzweigung, durch Modulation des PIN-vermittelten polaren Auxintransports und der pH-abhängigen radialen Auxindiffusion, auslöst.

Minimizers of generalized Willmore energies and applications in general relativity,"The Willmore functional is a function that maps an immersed Riemannian manifold to its total mean curvature. Finding closed surfaces that minimizes the Willmore energy, or more generally finding critical surfaces, is a classic problem of differential geometry. In this thesis we will develop the concept of generalized Willmore functionals for surfaces in Riemannian manifolds. We are guided by models in mathematical physics, such as the Hawking energy of general relativity and the bending energies for thin membranes. We prove the existence of minimizers under area constraint for these generalized Willmore functionals in a  suitable class of generalized surfaces. In particular, we construct minimizers of the bending energy mentioned above for prescribed area and enclosed volume. Furthermore, we prove that critical surfaces of generalized Willmore functionals with prescribed area are smooth, away from finitely many points.

Zur Chemie des Psilocins und verwandter Tryptaminverbindungen im pharmakologischen und ökologischen Kontext,"Dephosphorylation of psilocybin, the main alkaloid of Psilocybe (so-called 'magic') mushrooms, yields its bioactive congener psilocin (N,N-dimethyl-4-hydroxytryptamine). On top, psilocin is the chromogenic subtrate of the injury-triggered bluing reaction of these mushrooms. This work adresses the biochemical characterization and structural product elucidation of this very reaction. Initially upon wounding, the phosphatase PsiP catalyzes the conversion of psilocybin to psilocin, which is then oxidized to a heterogenous mixture of oligo- or polymers by the laccase PsiL. The coupling involves mainly the positions C-5 and C-7. The primary blue chromophore was identified as the psilocin-derived quinoid 7,7'-didehydrodimer. The bluing reaction and its products, to a degree resembling eumelanins and tannins, are discussed as a potential defense strategy (respectively an evolutionary advantage) of Psilocybe. A long-postulated intramolecular hydrogen bond in psilocin is experimentally verified. This bond plausibly provides the basis for both its oxidation lability as well as outstanding psychoactive properties, as opposed to e.g. its 5-hydroxy isomer bufotenin. Furthermore, this work identifies the secondary amine analogon of psilocin (norpsilocin) as a Psilocybe natural product, and contributes to the characterization of the native alkaloid profile of these mushrooms. Lastly, issues of large scale production of the psychotropic tryptamines are covered, which are of high relevance regarding the encouraging results of clinical trials on psilocybin as a future therapeutic for e.g. depressive disorders.",gnd:4141194-8 gnd:4176170-4 gnd:4007279-4
Discrete potential and function theories on a rectangular lattice and their applications,"The growing complexity of modern engineering problems necessitates development of advanced numerical methods. In particular, methods working directly with discrete structures, and thus, representing exactly some important properties of the solution on a lattice and not just approximating the continuous properties, become more and more popular nowadays. Among others, discrete potential theory and discrete function theory provide a variety of methods, which are discrete counterparts of the classical continuous methods for solving boundary value problems. A lot of results related to the discrete potential and function theories have been presented in recent years. However, these results are related to the discrete theories constructed on square lattices, and, thus, limiting their practical applicability and potentially leading to higher computational costs while discretising realistic domains.  This thesis presents an extension of the discrete potential theory and discrete function theory to rectangular lattices. As usual in the discrete theories, construction of discrete operators is strongly influenced by a definition of discrete geometric setting. For providing consistent constructions throughout the whole thesis, a detailed discussion on the discrete geometric setting is presented in the beginning. After that, the discrete fundamental solution of the discrete Laplace operator on a rectangular lattice, which is the core of the discrete potential theory, its numerical analysis, and practical calculations are presented. By using the discrete fundamental solution of the discrete Laplace operator on a rectangular lattice, the discrete potential theory is then constructed for interior and exterior settings. Several discrete interior and exterior boundary value problems are then solved. Moreover, discrete transmission problems are introduced and several numerical examples of these problems are discussed. Finally, a discrete fundamental solution of the discrete Cauchy-Riemann operator on a rectangular lattice is constructed, and basics of the discrete function theory on a rectangular lattice are provided. This work indicates that the discrete theories provide solution methods with very good numerical properties to tackle various boundary value problems, as well as transmission problems coupling interior and exterior problems. The results presented in this thesis provide a basis for further development of discrete theories on irregular lattices.",gnd:4018935-1 gnd:4158392-9 gnd:4129143-8 gnd:4046939-6

"Modernism in late-Mao China : architecture for foreign affairs in Beijing, Guangzhou and overseas, 1969-1976","This book investigates the architectural history of China in the Mao era (1949-1976), focusing on the rise of modernism in the last seven years of the Cultural Revolution from 1969 to 1976. It highlights the new architecture of this period, exemplified by three clusters of buildings for foreign affairs, namely buildings for foreign diplomacy in Beijing, buildings for foreign trade in Guangzhou and China's foreign aid projects overseas.The emergence of new architecture in the early 1970s is closely associated with China's political and diplomatic shift of the time, from a radical emphasis on ideological struggle to a dynamic balance between leftist ideology and pragmatic concerns. In this context, China's relations with the West quickly improved, culminating with American president Richard Nixon's visit to China in 1972. The increasing foreign affairs brought new opportunities to Chinese architects who referenced both Western modernism and Chinese architectural traditions to create a new version of Chinese modernism. The book brings dimensions of form, politics and knowledge to the analysis of architecture, to construct an understanding of architectural design as an aesthetic, political and intellectual practice.Modernism in Late-Mao China will be an enriching and useful reference for students and scholars who are interested in the global architectural history of the twentieth century, especially Cold War modernism",gnd:4002851-3 gnd:4120507-8

"Active galactic nuclei throughout the spectrum : M 87, PKS 2052-47, and the MOJAVE sample","Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are one of the many mysteries in the Universe. AGN hosts a super massive black hole (SMBH) in its center surrounded by a rotating accretion disk, and a powerful jet is ejected along the pole directions of the accretion disk. The powerful jet is definitely the highlight of AGN. Those extragalactic jets appears to have superluminal motions up to 60 c, and they are very luminous and variable across the electromagnetic spectrum. The jets can be highly polarized, which indicates the existence of strong magnetic fields; they can have a highly bended morphology due to reasons we do not completely understand. Astronomers have been studying AGN jets for the past decades by performing observations from the radio to the gamma-ray band, applying physical jet models to the observed properties, and trying to put the pieces into the whole picture.

The skew Brownian motion was introduced in the sixties by Itô and McKean, who constructed it from the reflected Brownian motion, flipping its excursions from the origin with a given probability. Such a process behaves as the original one except at the point 0, which plays the role of a semipermeable barrier. More generally, a skew diffusion with several semipermeable barriers, called multi-skew diffusion, is a diffusion everywhere except when it reaches one of the barriers, where it is partially reflected with a probability depending on that particular barrier. Clearly, a multi-skew diffusion can be characterized either as solution of a stochastic differential equation involving weighted local times (these terms providing the semi-permeability) or by its infinitesimal generator as Markov process.",gnd:4274463-5 gnd:4128328-4 gnd:4128130-5

Analysis of breed effects and genetic parameters of semen quality traits for frozen-thawed semen in stallions,"Despite improvements in recent years in the techniques of freezing semen for reproduction purposes, a considerable amount of stallions’ semen is still not suitable for providing frozen-thawed semen that fulfils the minimum quality requirements. Semen quality traits vary considerably between horse breeds, month and age of the stallions under similar environmental conditions. Therefore, the objectives of our study were to analyse the systematic effects on the quality traits of semen (fresh and frozen-thawed) collected in the breeding and non-breeding season. 5.1 Breed and stallion effects on frozen-thawed semen in Warmblood, Light and Quarter horses The objectives of the present study were to analyze systematic effects on semen quality traits from fresh and frozen-thawed semen collected in and outside season. A total of 4,681 reports on semen traits of 121 stallions representing Arabian, Thoroughbred, Quarter Horse and four warmblood breeds used for artificial insemination at the Lower Saxon National stud Celle were edited for analysis of gel-free volume, sperm concentration, total number of sperm and total number of motile sperm in fresh semen and in frozen-thawed semen progressive motility, DNA fragmentation index and non-viable sperm. Month, year, age, breed and stallions’ effects were analyzed with a linear mixed model procedure. Breed differences were significant for sperm concentration, total number of sperm, total motile sperm number and DNA fragmentation index. Hanoverian stallions showed significant higher least squares means for sperm concentration, total number of sperm and total motile sperm number in fresh semen, whereas Thoroughbred had significant higher least squares means for DNA fragmentation index. Stallions with an age of 2-6 years had significant lower least squares means in sperm concentration, total number of sperm and total motile sperm number and progressive motile sperm post-thawing than the other age groups. Month was significant for all semen traits but progressive motile sperm post-thawing. Month by age class interaction showed a significant influence. Inter-stallion variance accounted for 27-71% and the two-way stallion by month interaction for 2-7% of the total variance of semen quality traits. The largest proportion of inter-individual variance among stallions was explained by the DNA fragmentation index. 5.2 Genetic parameters and estimated breeding values for traits of raw and frozen-thawed semen in German Warmblood stallions Objectives of the present study were to estimate genetic parameters for frozen-thawed semen traits of 271 fertile German Warmblood stallions and genetic correlations with raw semen quality traits. Semen samples were collected from stallions utilized for semen collection and artificial insemination (AI) on the Lower Saxon National Stud Celle and the North Rhine-Westphalian National Stud Warendorf. Semen quality variables were analyzed in 63,972 raw (gel-free volume, concentration, progressive motility, number of sperm) and 3,681 frozen-thawed samples (motility, DNA fragmentation index (DFI), non-viable sperm). A multivariate linear animal model was used to estimate additive genetic and permanent environmental variances among stallions as well as estimated breeding values (EBVs) for all semen traits. Heritability estimates were greatest for DFI (h2 = 0.45) and least for non-viable sperm counts (h2 = 0.11). Additive genetic correlations between progressive sperm motility in raw semen and DFI (rg = -0.79) as well as non-viable sperm (rg = -0.45) were negative. The EBVs for frozen-thawed semen traits ranged from 49 to 181 with mean reliabilities of 0.28 to 0.43. The EBVs for progressively motile sperm post-thawing and DFI were the most highly correlated traits with EBVs for stallion fertility (r = 0.38 and r = -0.17). Stallions with relatively greater EBVs for progressive motility in raw semen may be most suitable when freezing semen for storage and subsequently thawing it for AI. Using EBVs for semen traits in selection of stallions to AI mares appears as an option for genetic improvement to enhance fertility after AI.",gnd:4024379-5 gnd:4344464-7 gnd:4048440-3 gnd:4012494-0 gnd:4113937-9 gnd:4133522-3

Market consequences of ICT innovations,"[""This volume was prepared by Constantin Mang while he was working at the Ifo Institute. It was completed in 2014 and accepted as a doctoral thesis by the Department of Economics at the University of Munich. It includes a short introduction and four self-contained chapters that focus on ICT innovations in different markets. Chapter 1gives a short introduction into the topic and lays out some general aspects about the methodological frameworks used in this volume. Chapter 2 is focused on the effects of broadband Internet on the housing market in order to quantify the value of broadband access in terms of a premium on housing rents. Methodologically, the chapter uses micro data from Germany’s largest online platform for real estate advertisements and estimates a hedonic model with rent prices. Chapter 3 investigates the association of online job search and matching quality using individual-level data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP). It measures matching quality by the respondent's evaluation of his new job compared to his former job. The results show that job changers who found their new job online are better matched than their counterparts who found their new job through traditional channels. Chapter 4 provides evidence on the effectiveness of PC use in schools across countries. Using data from the international student achievement test TIMSS, it estimate the effect of PC use on student test scores and finds that using a PC for some activities has positive effects on student achievement, whereas using a PC for other activities has negative effects. Chapter 5 investigates the effects of a mobile Internet infrastructure upgrade on the take-up of location-based online services. Using data from the largest German online platform for restaurant reviews, it finds that upgrading the mobile Internet infrastructure increases the number of restaurant reviews and the share of reviews written on smartphones."", 'Die vorliegende Arbeit wurde von Constantin Mang während seiner Tätigkeit am ifo Institut verfasst.

The live centre of information : from Pompidou to Beaubourg : 1968-1971,"""When, on July 19, 1971, Jean Prouvé and Robert Bordaz unveiled the competition-winning design for the Centre Beaubourg in Paris, now known as the Centre national d'art et de culture Georges Pompidou, press and public reaction was harsh. The project architects, Renzo Piano, Richard Rogers, and Gianfranco Franchini, were considered ""unknowns""; its promoters, the engineers of the firm Ove Arup & Partners, were simply forgotten; the original idea of a ""Live Centre of Information,"" with its sequences of flexible platforms suspended over an open-air piazza for the crowd, was misrepresented and reduced to the image of a ""metallic dam"" dropped in the heart of Paris; the jury, which featured figures of the caliber of Prouvé, Oscar Niemeyer, and Willem Sandberg, was believed to have been dominated by the charismatic Philip Johnson; the man who initiated the competition, President Georges Pompidou of France, was believed to be unaware of the jury's methods and forced unwillingly to accept a winner he didn't support. Fifty years after those events, through the tool of the chronicle and recourse to all available documentary sources and dozens of testimonies, it is time to analyze these false certainties and trace the genealogy of this famous and still controversial work: from President Pompidou's original idea of a monument to reinvigorate French architecture in the international debate to the complex origins of a project in which the aspirations and avant-garde impulses of architects and engineers delicately coexisted, to the reconstruction of the complex political plots and ideological visions that lurked behind the jury's deliberations""--",gnd:4002857-4 gnd:4124970-7 gnd:4004911-5
Planets of young stars : the TLS-Tautenburg radial velocity survey,"The discovery and characterization of planets of young stars represents an important goal as it will allow to put much stronger observational constraints on the current theories of planet formation and orbital evolution. This thesis reports the results of an optical spectroscopic survey of a sample of 43 young (30-300 Myr), late spectral type, nearby stars. Observations have been carried out with the 2m Schmidt telescope and the Coudé spectrograph at the TLS-Tautenburg Observatory, and were aimed to measure high precision radial velocities (RV). In spite of their enhanced level of photospheric activity inducing RV-jitters, the survey demonstrates that also young stars are suitable targets for the detection of planets by means of the RV-technique. In fact most of the stars in the sample show a RV-scatter < 30 m/s Seven spectroscopic binaries have been detected, and for 2 of them the best-fit RV-curve has been calculated and the orbital parameters derived. No planet has been found with a sufficiently high level of confidence. There is only one target showing a RV-signal compatible with a planet of mass M = 0.16 Mj (Jupiter mass), which deserves further investigations...",gnd:4456110-6 gnd:4319480-1 gnd:4174796-3
Pyrocatalysis for micropollutant degradation in water : development of active pyrocatalysts,"Die kumulative Dissertation beschäftigt sich mit der experimentellen Erforschung der Pyrokatalyse für die oxidative Mikroschadstoffentfernung aus (Ab-)Wasser. Dabei wurde zunächst eine geeignete Modellreaktion entwickelt und evaluiert. Mit dieser wurden anschließend in einer zweistufigen Katalysatorentwicklung aktive Pyrokatalysatoren identifiziert und die zugrundeliegenden Struktur-Aktivitäts-Beziehungen herausgearbeitet. Es wurden Pyrokatalysatoren auf Basis von BaTiO3-Pulvern entwicklt, deren katalytische Aktivität um ein Vielfaches größer war, als die der Ausgangsverbindungen. Mit diesen konnte schließlich erstmalig ein pyrokatalytischer Abbau von relevanten Mikroschadstoffen (Bisphenol A) erreicht werden.

First, a suitable model reaction was developed and evaluated. This was then used to identify active pyrocatalysts in a two-stage catalyst development process and to work out the underlying structure-activity relationships. Pyrocatalysts based on BaTiO3 powders were developed whose catalytic activity was many times greater than that of the starting compounds. With these, a pyrocatalytic degradation of relevant micropollutants (bisphenol A) was finally achieved for the first time.

Novel coherent supercontinuum light sources based on all-normal dispersion fibers,"The concept of broadband coherent supercontinuum (SC) generation in all-normal dispersion (ANDi) fibers in the near-infrared, visible and ultraviolet (UV) spectral regions is introduced and investigated in detail. In numerical studies, explicit design criteria are established for ANDi photonic crystal fiber (PCF) designs that allow the generation of flat and smooth ultrabroad spectral profiles without significant fine structure and with excellent stability and coherence properties. The key benefit of SC generation in ANDi fibers is the conservation of a single ultrashort pulse in the time domain with smooth and recompressible phase distribution. Self-phase modulation and optical wave breaking are identified as the dominant nonlinear effects responsible for the nonlinear spectral broadening. It is further demonstrated that coherence properties, spectral bandwidth and temporal compressibility are independent of input pulse duration for constant peak power. The numerical predictions are in excellent agreement with experimental results obtained in two realizations of ANDi PCF optimized for the near-infrared and visible spectral region. In these experiments, the broadest SC spectrum generated in the normal dispersion regime of an optical fiber to date is achieved. The exceptional temporal properties of the generated SC pulses are demonstrated by their application in ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy and by their temporal recompression to sub-two cycle durations by linear chirp compensation. The concept is further extended to tapered optical fibers with submicron diameter. Realized either as freestanding photonic nanowire or suspended core fiber, these tapered ANDi fibers allow the generation of coherent SC spectra with considerable spectral power densities in the usually hard to reach wavelength region below 300 nm.",gnd:4167589-7 gnd:4222149-3

Design Intelligence : Human-Centered-Design for the development of industrial AI/ML agents,"This study deals with design for AI/ML systems, more precisely in the industrial AI context based on case studies from the factory automation field. It therefore touches on core concepts from Human-Centered-Design (HCD), User Experience (UX) and Human Computer Interaction (HCI) on one hand, as well as concepts from Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) and the impact of technology on the other. The case studies the research is based on are within the industrial AI domain. However, the final outcomes, the findings, solutions, artifacts and so forth, should be transferable to a wider spectrum of domains. The study’s aim is to examine the role of designers in the age of AI and the factors which are relevant, based on the hypothesis that current AI/ML development lacks the human perspective, which means that there are pitfalls and challenges that design can help resolve. The initial literature review revealed that AI/ML are perceived as a new design material that calls for a new design paradigm. Additional research based on qualitative case study research was conducted to gain an overview of the relevant issues and challenges. From this, 17 themes emerged, which together with explorative expert interviews and a structured literature review, were further analyzed to produce the relevant HCD, UX and HCI themes. It became clear that designers need new processes, methods, and tools in the age of AI/ML in combination with not only design, but also data science and business expertise, which is why the proposed solution in this PhD features process modules for design, data science and business collaboration. There are seven process modules and their related activities and dependencies that serve as guidelines for practitioners who want to design intelligence. A unified framework for collecting use case exemplars was created, based on a workshop with different practitioners and researchers from the area of AI/ML to support and enrich the process modules with concrete projects examples.",gnd:1232346071 gnd:4033447-8 gnd:1262007852 gnd:1262853559 gnd:4237203-3
Informatische Schlüsselkompetenzen : Konzepte der Informationstechnologie im Sinne einer informatischen Allgemeinbildung,"['In the German language areas of Europe there have been discussions concerning the concepts of key qualifications and competencies since the 1960s. Part one of this dissertation examines these discussions and their meaning for computer science education. Conceptual frameworks, suitable for all educational disciplines and contexts, are designed which permit the classification and structuring of competencies. Part two presents a methodology for the derivation of key competencies that is free of normative elements and procedures. This is achieved by applying qualitative content analyses (QCA) to various didactic approaches of computer science education. The competencies thus found are then filtered by general education criteria, yielding key competencies in informatics. The key competencies generated in this way draw a very specific picture of computer science / informatics and can be used in the analysis of existing curricula. <engl.>', 'Seit den 60er Jahren gibt es im deutschsprachigen Raum Diskussionen um die Begriffe Schlüsselqualifikation und (Schlüssel-)Kompetenz, welche seit ca. 2000 auch in der Informatikdidaktik angekommen sind.

Anisotropic filtering of non-linear surface features,"A new method for noise removal of arbitrary surfaces meshes is presented which focuses on the preservation and sharpening of non-linear geometric features such as curved surface regions and feature lines. Our method uses a prescribed mean curvature flow (PMC) for simplicial surfaces which is based on three new contributions: 1. the definition and efficient calculation of a discrete shape operator and principal curvature properties on simplicial surfaces that is fully consistent with the well-known discrete mean curvature formula, 2. an anisotropic discrete mean curvature vector that combines the advantages of the mean curvature normal with the special anisotropic behaviour along feature lines of a surface, and 3. an anisotropic prescribed mean curvature flow which converges to surfaces with an estimated mean curvature distribution and with preserved non-linear features. Additionally, the PMC flow prevents boundary shrinkage at constrained and free boundary segments.",gnd:4012248-7 gnd:4235959-4
Stability of the large low shear velocity provinces : numerical modeling of thermochemical mantle convection,"We study segregation of the subducted oceanic crust (OC) at the core mantle boundary and its ability to accumulate and form large thermochemical piles (such as the seismically observed Large Low Shear Velocity Provinces - LLSVPs). Our high-resolution numerical simulations suggest that the longevity of LLSVPs for up to three billion years, and possibly longer, can be ensured by a balance in the rate of segregation of high-density OC-material to the CMB, and the rate of its entrainment away from the CMB by mantle upwellings. For a range of parameters tested in this study, a large-scale compositional anomaly forms at the CMB, similar in shape and size to the LLSVPs. Neutrally buoyant thermochemical piles formed by mechanical stirring - where thermally induced negative density anomaly is balanced by the presence of a fraction of dense anomalous material - best resemble the geometry of LLSVPs. Such neutrally buoyant piles tend to emerge and survive for at least 3Gyr in simulations with quite different parameters. We conclude that for a plausible range of values of density anomaly of OC material in the lower mantle - it is likely that it segregates to the CMB, gets mechanically mixed with the ambient material, and forms neutrally buoyant large scale compositional anomalies similar in shape to the LLSVPs. We have developed an efficient FEM code with dynamically adaptive time and space resolution, and marker-in-cell methodology. This enabled us to model thermochemical mantle convection at realistically high convective vigor, strong thermally induced viscosity variations, and long term evolution of compositional fields.",gnd:4078260-8 gnd:4354719-9 gnd:4338132-7 gnd:4401792-3
Ultrafast electron dynamics in Fe(CO)5 and Cr(CO)6,"In this thesis, the two prototype catalysts Fe(CO)₅ and Cr(CO)₆ are investigated with time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy at a high harmonic setup. In both of these metal carbonyls, a UV photon can induce the dissociation of one or more ligands of the complex. The mechanism of the dissociation has been debated over the last decades. The electronic dynamics of the first dissociation occur on the femtosecond timescale. For the experiment, an existing high harmonic setup was moved to a new location, was extended, and characterized. The modified setup can induce dynamics in gas phase samples with photon energies of 1.55eV, 3.10eV, and 4.65eV. The valence electronic structure of the samples can be probed with photon energies between 20eV and 40eV. The temporal resolution is 111fs to 262fs, depending on the combination of the two photon energies.

Bacterial zoonose : molecular characterization of antimicrobial resistance and pathogenicity from one-health perspective,"The extensive use of broad-spectrum antibiotics in human medicine, farm animals, and the food industry has led to multidrug-resistant bacteria. The studies carried out within the scope of this Habilitation work aimed at resistance profiling and better understanding the mechanisms of resistance development and pathogenicity in the leading multiple drug resistance (MDR) bacterial pathogens known to cause nosocomial infections, such as ESKAPE pathogens, i.e. Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), as well as bacteria causing neglected zoonoses such as Brucella. Combined in-vitro phenotyping with in-silico molecular analysis using Illumina MiSeq Next-Generation-Sequencing (NGS) technology and BioIT pipelines on a large number of clinical and non-clinical strains collected from Europe, Asia, and Africa were applied to achieve the goal of the One-Health approach. Antimicrobial resistance is a growing concern in veterinary medicine, the food chain, and the environment as in human medicine. However, data on animals, foods and environmental sources are still scarce. The emergence and dissemination of certain ESKAPE pathogens such as A. baumannii and K. pneumonia were reported since the late 20th century and increased over time in developed and developing countries. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is a powerful tool for rapidly identifying antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes and can define resistance-associated determinants with much greater precision compared to conventional phenotypic tools.

How does adhesion influence the small aggregates in Saturn's rings,"Particles in Saturn’s main rings range in size from dust to even kilometer-sized objects. Their size distribution is thought to be a result of competing accretion and fragmentation processes. While growth is naturally limited in tidal environments, frequent collisions among these objects may contribute to both accretion and fragmentation. As ring particles are primarily made of water ice attractive surface forces like adhesion could significantly influence these processes, finally determining the resulting size distribution. Here, we derive analytic expressions for the specific self-energy Q and related specific break-up energy Q⋆ of aggregates. These expressions can be used for any aggregate type composed of monomeric constituents. We compare these expressions to numerical experiments where we create aggregates of various types including: regular packings like the face-centered cubic (fcc), Ballistic Particle Cluster Aggregates (BPCA), and modified BPCAs including e.g. different constituent size distributions. We show that accounting for attractive surface forces such as adhesion a simple approach is able to: a) generally account for the size dependence of the specific break-up energy for fragmentation to occur reported in the literature, namely the division into “strength” and “gravity” regimes, and b) estimate the maximum aggregate size in a collisional ensemble to be on the order of a few meters, consistent with the maximum aggregate size observed in Saturn’s rings of about 10m",gnd:4385093-5
Dense stellar systems and massive black holes : sources of gravitational radiation and tidal disruptions,"Gravity dictates the structure of the whole Universe and, although it is triumphantly described by the theory of General Relativity, it is the force that we least understand in nature. One of the cardinal predictions of this theory are black holes. Massive, dark objects are found in the majority of galaxies. Our own galactic center very contains such an object with a mass of about four million solar masses. Are these objects supermassive black holes (SMBHs), or do we need alternatives? The answer lies in the event horizon, the characteristic that defines a black hole. The key to probe the horizon is to model the movement of stars around a SMBH, and the interactions between them, and look for deviations from real observations. Nuclear star clusters harboring a massive, dark object with a mass of up to ~ ten million solar masses are good testbeds to probe the event horizon of the potential SMBH with stars. The channel for interactions between stars and the central MBH are the fact that (a) compact stars and stellar-mass black holes can gradually inspiral into the SMBH due to the emission of gravitational radiation, which is known as an “Extreme Mass Ratio Inspiral” (EMRI), and (b) stars can produce gases which will be accreted by the SMBH through normal stellar evolution, or by collisions and disruptions brought about by the strong central tidal field. Such processes can contribute significantly to the mass of the SMBH. These two processes involve different disciplines, which combined will provide us with detailed information about the fabric of space and time. In this habilitation I present nine articles of my recent work directly related with these topics.",gnd:4158119-2 gnd:4150454-9 gnd:4053793-6 gnd:4169052-7

Design for a testing model of a communication subsystem for a safety-critical control system,"This monograph focuses on a proposal for a testing model in safety critical systems.

The system testing that we are using is not clearly integrated into the process of design and development of safety critical systems. Therefore, we have proposed basic steps of this process to which we have integrated system testing. Given the scope of the system testing, we have decided to propose two testing models.

Operational modal analysis : Theory and aspects of application in civil engineering,"In recent years the demand on dynamic analyses of existing structures in civil engineering has remarkably increased. These analyses are mainly based on numerical models. Accordingly, the generated results depend on the quality of the used models. Therefore it is very important that the models describe the considered systems such that the behaviour of the physical structure is realistically represented. As any model is based on assumptions, there is always a certain degree of uncertainty present in the results of a simulation based on the respective numerical model. To minimise these uncertainties in the prediction of the response of a structure to a certain loading, it has become common practice to update or calibrate the parameters of a numerical model based on observations of the structural behaviour of the respective existing system. ...",gnd:4226174-0 gnd:4226177-6
The effects of checkpoint kinase 1 and the cell cycle on secondary immunoglobulin diversification,"In vertebrates, the process of immunoglobulin (Ig) diversification via VDJ recombination leads to the generation of a vast repertoire of B lymphocytes that are reactive to a wide variety of pathogens. Upon recognition of their cognate antigen, the reactive B cells undergo clonal expansion within organs such as the spleen and lymph nodes forming germinal centers. At the same time, the Ig genes of activated B cells undergo deliberate damage by the enzyme activation-induced deaminase (AID) that converts cytosines to uracils with the purpose to “adapt” the antibody response to the antigen to be defeated. In cells other than the B cells, U:G mismatches are faithfully repaired but in mouse and human B cells the AID-induced lesions are processed by error-prone repair mechanisms. As a consequence, mutations accumulate leading to antibody affinity maturation via somatic hypermutation (SHM) and deletional events of recombination can occur resulting in the Ig isotype switch via class switch recombination (CSR). The mechanisms responsible for the shift from error-free towards error-prone mechanisms of DNA repair at the Ig genes are not yet completely understood. In this thesis, the effects of attenuated DNA damage responses via Checkpoint kinase 1 and the role of the cell cycle during secondary Ig diversification have been investigated.",gnd:4268693-3 gnd:4129960-7 gnd:4049338-6 gnd:4026626-6 gnd:4147096-5 gnd:4501295-7

Fabrication and characterization of innovative bottom-up plasmonic nanostructures,"The present thesis introduces the research of various fabrication strategies of bottom-up plasmonic nanostructures for the bio-analytical application. First, a novel label-free P. ramorum detection platform was realized employing SERS. This invasive plant pathogen was successfully detected and the entire analysis chain including, sample preparation, DNA isolation, amplification and hybridization on SERS-active silver substrate-immobilized adenine-free capture probes is introduced in the thesis. Later, the above introduced silver plasmonic arrays, so called EGNPs, were coated with the dielectric material Al2O3 using atomic layer deposition (ALD). These procedure increased their sensitivity, specificity and shelf-life. Second, hierarchically designed 3D flower-like hybrid nanostructures were developed by combining the metastable property of EGNPs substrates with plasma enhanced atomic layer deposition (PE-ALD). The resulting ultra-stable nanostructures were established as an efficient SERS-template substrate. Finally, an alternative silver nanoparticle synthesizing method using microwave radiation was proposed. This employs as a reliable, rapid, simple, reproducible and environmental friendly bottom-up fabrication strategy. The approach was implemented to the glass capillaries. An ultra-sensitive and high reproducible novel SERS-based capillary platform was developed and applied for the trace detection of THC.  For this purpose, not only the physical, material and optical properties of these developed nanostructures were characterized but also their SERS efficiency was studied in detail. The developed novel SERS-active nanostructures show improved SERS performance in terms of high SERS reproducibility, surface uniformity, easy synthesis, cost-effectiveness, easy handling and high signal to noise ratio. Finally, the great potential of those novel SERS-active substrates in the field of biochemical and trace detection of an illegal drug were highlighted.",gnd:4204530-7 gnd:4176916-8 gnd:4048610-2 gnd:4184890-1

Interplay between tectonics and magmatism in the internal Dinarides,"The Sava suture zone that runs across the Balkan peninsula contains Maastrichtian trench-fill sediments, termed Sava flysch, that record the closure of the northern branch of the Neotethys. Subsequent collision between Adria-derived thrust sheets and blocks of European affinity in Latest Cretaceous to Paleogene times culminated in the formation of the Dinarides fold-andthrust-belt. The suture zone hosts numerous plutons of I-type granitic composition of Oligocene age. Many of these intrusions are located in the center of metamorphic core complexes (MCCs) that were exhumed in early Miocene times. This phase of post-collisional extension was concomitant with the opening of the northerly adjacent Pannonian Basin and associated with granitic S-type magmatism. The processes responsible for extensional deformation and magmatic activity in the internal Dinarides are still a matter of debate. The data of the present study shows an asynchronous extensional reactivation of formerly contractional structures that gave rise to these core complexes as low-angle detachments in the early Miocene. This is indicated by a variation in deformation ages of 3 Ma, obtained by Ar-Ar in-situ dating of white mica from deformed rocks of the respective shear zones. While Motajica MCC was exhumed from within the Sava zone during E-W extension at approximately 20 Ma, Cer MCC was exhumed as part of the underlying Adriatic basement during N-S extension between 17-16 Ma. For the Cer MCC, a concordia age of 17.6±0.1 Ma (2σ) obtained by U-Pb LA-ICP-MS on zircons from a structurally and petrographically well constrained and undeformed S-type granite in combination with an Ar-Ar inverse isochron age of 16.6±0.2 Ma (2σ) obtained on white mica from the same sample, indicate a cooling rate of approximately 400°C/Ma. The results of this study contribute to the idea of rapid exhumation of mid-crustal material in the form of MCCs in response to the opening of the Pannonian Basin.",gnd:4228025-4 gnd:4059351-4
Integral field spectroscopy of the GQ lup companion,Only few ultra low mass substellar objects are currently observed in their earliest stages of formation. Their exact formation process is only poorly understood and a matter of debate. Evolutionary models oversimplify the initial conditions and are highly speculative for objects up to a few Myr of age. The spectral properties of such objects are hard to model. At extremely low temperatures and low surface gravities complex molecular chemistry and dust formation challenges theoreticians to compute synthetic spectra of high reliability. The extreme scarcity of anchor points - objects whose mass and radius can be measured directly - enhances the difficulties in properly describing and classifying such objects.,gnd:4180348-6 gnd:4346723-4 gnd:4384871-0
Role of the actin cytoskeleton in cellular morphogenesis at the shoot apical meristem of Arabidopsis thaliana,"The morphogenesis of sessile plants is mainly driven by directional cell growth and cell division. The organization of their cytoskeleton and the mechanical properties of the cell wall greatly influence morphogenetic events in plants. It is well known that cortical microtubules (CMTs) contribute to directional growth by regulating the deposition of the cellulose microfibrils, as major cell wall fortifying elements. More recent findings demonstrate that mechanical stresses existing in cells and tissues influence microtubule organization. Also, in dividing cells, mechanical stress directions contribute to the orientation of the new cell wall. In comparison to the microtubule cytoskeleton, the role of the actin cytoskeleton in regulating shoot meristem morphogenesis has not been extensively studied. This thesis focuses on the functional relevance of the actin cytoskeleton during cell and tissue scale morphogenesis in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) of Arabidopsis thaliana.

Ends of graphs,"Our topic is infinite graph theory, with our focus on the ends of an infinite graph (which can be informally viewed as endpoints of rays), and their role in extensions of results known for finite graphs. Often, these extensions fail, if one does not take into account the ends of the graph, but otherwise hold. In other cases, results become more interesting when ends are considered as well as vertices. An example for the latter is the Erdös-Menger conjecture for infinite graphs (recently proved by Aharoni and Berger): we shall prove a generalization which allows for ends in the considered paths and separators. This means that in an infinite graph, we allow paths to be infinite. Moreover, considering ends on a par with vertices, we will allow these paths, then called arcs, to start or end in ends, and to pass through them. Similarly, the notion of a cycle will be generalized to that of a (possibly infinite) circle, which may pass through ends. This leads to a different notion of forests (so-called topological forests) in infinite graphs. Another aspect of the ends is that since in many ways they behave like vertices, they should be attributed a degree. We introduce such a notion as well as a concept of parity for ends. For ends of finite degree the parity will coincide with the parity of the degree, while ends of infinite degree will be classified into &lsquo;even&rsquo; and &lsquo;odd&rsquo;. Using these concepts (arcs, circles, topological forests, degrees and parities of ends) we extend several results from finite graph theory verbatim to infinite graphs.",gnd:4839591-2 gnd:4390888-3 gnd:4630853-2 gnd:4839590-0

Development and characterization of a microscope based on pump-probe spectroscopy : a valuable tool for the study of photoactivated drugs in cellulo,"This thesis presents the construction and characterization of a microscope based on pumpprobe spectroscopy and its application to observe and study the evolution of photoinduced reactions. As compared to the typical pump-probe systems reported in the literature, which utilizes either 1 kHz or 80 MHz pulse-trains, the developed microscope was fed by pump pulse-trains at 125 kHz and probe pulse-trains at 250 kHz repetition rates in order to perform transient absorption microscopy (TAM). The use of such intermediate repetition rate reduces the unnecessary exposure of the sample to input field leading to risk of photo-induced damage and it also relaxes the use of lock-in detection, an unavoidable element for any MHz system, which increases the cost and complexity of the system. This gives the possibility to perform microspectroscopic studies of micro-structures with minimal photo-induced damage, a property that is especially important to the study of biological samples, without the incorporation of lock-in detection. Therefore, the developed TAM system by itself is a proof of concept.",gnd:4601119-5 gnd:4167475-3

Investigation into the thermal dehydroxylation and decomposition of hydroxylapatite during atmospheric plasma spraying : NMR and Raman spectroscopic study of as-sprayed coatings and coatings incubated in simulated body fluid,"Hydroxylapatite (HA) is a frequently used bioceramic material for replacement of bone matter subjected to low loading conditions, for osseoconductive coatings on implants and for utilisation as a drug carrier. Plasma spraying is widely used to coat hydroxylapatite onto titanium alloys in hip endoprostheses. However, the high temperature of the plasma jet changes the crystallinity and decomposes hydroxylapatite. This affects in turn its bioconductivity. In this study, HA was coated onto Ti6Al4V substrates by atmospheric plasma spraying (APS). Also, a bionert TiO2 bond coat was applied between the HA coating and the titanium alloy. By means of some sensitive analytical techniques, notably nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and Raman spectroscopy, the structural decomposition of HA during plasma-spraying and the in vitro reconstruction mechanisms of distorted (oxy)hydroxylapatite to well-ordered hydroxylapatite were investigated.

Nonlinearities in carbon allocation and vegetation functioning,"Vegetation, one of the major C sinks with respect to the atmosphere, has an indispensable role in the global carbon cycle; it assimilates atmospheric CO2 via photosynthesis and distributes the assimilated C among plant parts with different cycling rates. These processes can be generalized into one main concept: carbon allocation (CA). Since vegetation has different CA strategies to survive changing climate and disturbance regimes, the efforts towards a better understanding of CA in vegetation have increased, particularly through the development of Dynamic Vegetation Models (DVMs). However, there is no consensus in the model representation of CA, i.e., there are discrepancies among predicted trajectories, as well as between model predictions and empirical observations. This lack of consensus goes in hand with the quest to find a balance between precise predictions and a good level of abstraction; detailed models require high computer power, whereas simpler models may fail to capture complex dynamics such as nonlinearities. Additionally, not all processes that are relevant for ecosystem dynamics take place at the same space/time resolution, and they are not understood with the same level of detail. Thus, upscaling and simplification are another source of uncertainty. These issues have motivated several model intercomparisons and conceptual reviews, yet none of them have focused on their mathematical formulation. In this PhD thesis, three fundamental aspects of the CA component in ecosystem models are assessed. First, common mathematical representations of CA are evaluated and synthesized into a new framework that benefits from concepts of dynamical systems theory; second, this framework is used to select pertinent diagnostics of model performance, such as the distributions of carbon ages and transit times, based on model properties (e.g. autonomy and linearity); and third, the long standing puzzle of source and sink limitation on CA is approached from the dynamical systems perspective of the proposed framework, using a simple nonlinear model. The implications that these nonlinearities have for the model behaviour are also discussed.",gnd:4164552-2 gnd:4187458-4 gnd:4013396-5

Isogeometric boundary element analysis and structural shape optimization for Helmholtz acoustic problems,"In this thesis, a new approach is developed for applications of shape optimization on the time harmonic wave propagation (Helmholtz equation) for acoustic problems.

BEM is superior for handling unbounded domains by modeling only the inner boundaries and avoiding the truncation error, present in the finite element method (FEM) since BEM solutions satisfy the Sommerfeld radiation condition automatically. Moreover, BEM reduces the space dimension by one from a volumetric three-dimensional problem to a surface two-dimensional problem, or from a surface two-dimensional problem to a perimeter one-dimensional problem. Non-uniform rational B-splines basis functions (NURBS) are used in an isogeometric setting to describe both the CAD geometries and the physical fields. ...",gnd:4076508-8 gnd:7718401-4 gnd:4000988-9 gnd:4159528-2 gnd:4329076-0
Würde und Demenz : Grundlegung einer Pflegeethik,"['Using the example of the dignity of people with dementia as its basis, this book addresses the foundations of care ethics.In medical ethics, dignity is often equated with ‘respect for autonomy’.

Charge carrier dynamics in InGaN quantum wells : stimulated emission depletion and lateral charge carrier motion,"Zusammenfassung: Over the last decade Indium Gallium Nitride (InGaN) based LEDs have become one of the dominating light sources in cases where high efficiency and compact form factors are required. Despite having already reached a very high efficiency level, there is still room for further improvement. Charge carrier motion and recombination dynamics are essential processes when it comes to understanding and improving solid state based lighting technology on a fundamental level. Two experimental techniques based on confocal microscopy are used in the present work to study charge carrier dynamics and motion in InGaN based quantum well LED structures. It focuses on the investigation of stimulated emission depletion (STED) and lateral charge carrier motion, i.e. motion of charge carriers within the quantum well plane. In the first part the properties of the STED effect in blue InGaN quantum wells are studied using different continuous wave and pulsed laser sources. The samples are excited at 405 nm and depletion of the excited charge carriers is induced by stimulated emission using a second laser source with a wavelength in the long wavelength part of the fluorescence spectrum. It is found that only a partial fluorescence suppression of about 10% can be achieved in the investigated samples. This is not sufficient to use the STED effect for spatial resolution enhancement like it has already been successfully demonstrated for fluorescence dyes in studies of other authors. Two main processes are identified to be responsible for the partial fluorescence suppression. The first is the availability of only a limited number of localized states in the band structure being susceptible to depletion by stimulated emission. Their number is too small to allow for a sufficient depletion rate. The second effect is strong two photon absorption induced by the depletion laser. The enhanced non-linear absorption leads to an increase in fluorescence intensity and thus counteracts the depletion effect over a wide range of depletion laser powers. Extending the rate equation model normally used to describe STED by two photon absorption shows, that there might still be a chance to achieve higher fluorescence suppression outside of the experimentally accessible parameter space. A confocal time of flight method is used in the second part to measure for the first time the temperature and charge carrier density dependent in-plane diffusion constant of a turquoise InGaN multi quantum well ...",gnd:4375592-6 gnd:4460230-3

The reactions proceed via primary attack of the P-lone electron pair, as shown by the synthesis of phosphonium glycolates from tertiary phosphines and glyoxylic acid, and addition of PH at the carbonyl group. The ring closure proceeds by replacement of the hydroxy by the amino group and is kinetically controlled. NMR monitoring of the phosphaprolines in CD3OD over several days indicates changes of the diastereoisomer ratios leading to higher contents of the more stable trans-diastereoisomers. The zwitterionic compounds are soluble in part in CD3OD, DMF or DMSO, are somewhat sensitive to air in solution and may undergo hydrolysis with larger amounts of water. The structures are proved by multinuclear NMR spectra and two crystal structure analyses.

Hydro- and biogeochemical investigations of lake sediments in the Kenyan Rift Valley,"The lakes in the Kenyan Rift Valley offer the unique opportunity to study a wide range of hydrochemical environmental conditions, ranging from freshwater to highly saline and alkaline lakes. Because little is known about the hydro- and biogeochemical conditions in the underlying lake sediments, it was the aim of this study to extend the already existing data sets with data from porewater and biomarker analyses. Additionally, reduced sulphur compounds and sulphate reduction rates in the sediment were determined. The new data was used to examine the anthropogenic and microbial influence on the lakes sediments as well as the influence of the water chemistry on the degradation and preservation of organic matter in the sediment column. The lakes discussed in this study are: Logipi, Eight (a small crater lake in the region of Kangirinyang), Baringo, Bogoria, Naivasha, Oloiden, and Sonachi.

Regional groundwater representation by coupling the mesoscale Hydrologic Model (mHM) with OpenGeoSys (OGS) : model development and case studies,"Groundwater is the source of approximately twenty percent of the world’s freshwater supply. It is also one of the most important sources of water for irrigation. However, groundwater has been over-used and polluted in many places in the world. Climate change and saltwater intrusion are threatening groundwater resources. The groundwater system throughout the world is subject to many potential contamination sources, such as storage tanks, abandoned industrial factories, nitrates from agricultural activities, pesticides, and atmospheric contaminants. Meanwhile, numerical models provide a quantitative framework for integrating field information and for characterizing hydrogeologic processes and have been widely used to forecast the results of a proposed action/inaction. In reality, the terrestrial hydrologic cycle is a continuous system. The groundwater flow is intricately and tightly linked with the land surface processes and states (e.g., recharge, evapotranspiration, soil moisture, and overland flow). Historically, the surface hydrologic models and groundwater models have been developed separately due to the distinct characteristics of land surface processes and deep groundwater processes. Generally, the surface hydrologic models have a good predictive capability of flood events but constantly fall short in predicting the low flow. The reason behind this is the absence of explicit groundwater representation. Meanwhile, groundwater models focus on representing slow groundwater flow and transport but always use oversimplified upper boundaries (e.g., empirical estimation of recharge). Therefore, the coupling between the surface hydrologic models and the subsurface hydrogeologic models are urgently needed. This study is devoted to improving the characterization of regional groundwater flow and transport processes through the coupling of the mesoscale Hydrologic Model (mHM) and the hydrogeological model OpenGeoSys (OGS). The proposed mHM-OGS coupled model is applied to assess the regional groundwater resource of a mesoscale catchment in central Germany (Nägelstedt). The mHM-OGS coupled model can reasonably simulate the transient behavior of groundwater levels. It is also a valuable tool in estimating travel time distributions (TTDs) with its capability in explicitly characterizing the subsurface hydraulic heterogeneity and dealing with input and parameter uncertainties. Results of ensemble simulations show that the groundwater TTD in Nägelstedt catchment is strongly dependent on the rate and the spatial pattern of recharge. Meanwhile, the internal hydraulic properties also have a moderate impact on the shape of groundwater TTD. The mHM-OGS coupled model is also a valuable tool in evaluating regional groundwater resources under climate change. An ensemble of climate scenarios are set up to assess the uncertainty in climate projections under 1.5, 2, and 3  C global warming. Simulation results indicate a small increase in groundwater quantity and a moderate decrease in groundwater mean travel time in Nägelstedt catchment. Additionally, a large predictive uncertainty is found in the simulation results, which is mainly introduced from the climate projections. The global warming ultimately influences the regional groundwater quality at the long term through the modification of groundwater travel time distributions.",gnd:4026309-5 gnd:4338132-7 gnd:4026307-1 gnd:4172265-6 gnd:4121396-8

Model-driven security in service-oriented architectures : leveraging security patterns to transform high-level security requirements to technical policies,"Service-oriented Architectures (SOA) facilitate the provision and orchestration of business services to enable a faster adoption to changing business demands. Web Services provide a technical foundation to implement this paradigm on the basis of XML-messaging. However, the enhanced flexibility of message-based systems comes along with new threats and risks. To face these issues, a variety of security mechanisms and approaches is supported by the Web Service specifications. The usage of these security mechanisms and protocols is configured by stating security requirements in security policies. However, security policy languages for SOA are complex and difficult to create due to the expressiveness of these languages. To facilitate and simplify the creation of security policies, this thesis presents a model-driven approach that enables the generation of complex security policies on the basis of simple security intentions. SOA architects can specify these intentions in system design models and are not required to deal with complex technical security concepts. The approach introduced in this thesis enables the enhancement of any system design modelling languages – for example FMC or BPMN – with security modelling elements. The syntax, semantics, and notion of these elements is defined by our security modelling language SecureSOA. The metamodel of this language provides extension points to enable the integration into system design modelling languages. In particular, this thesis demonstrates the enhancement of FMC block diagrams with SecureSOA. To enable the model-driven generation of security policies, a domain-independent policy model is introduced in this thesis. This model provides an abstraction layer for security policies. Mappings are used to perform the transformation from our model to security policy languages. However, expert knowledge is required to generate instances of this model on the basis of simple security intentions. Appropriate security mechanisms, protocols and options must be chosen and combined to fulfil these security intentions. In this thesis, a formalised system of security patterns is used to represent this knowledge and to enable an automated transformation process. Moreover, a domain-specific language is introduced to state security patterns in an accessible way. On the basis of this language, a system of security configuration patterns is provided to transform security intentions related to data protection and identity management. The formal semantics of the security pattern language enable the verification of the transformation process introduced in this thesis and prove the correctness of the pattern application. Finally, our SOA Security LAB is presented that demonstrates the application of our model-driven approach to facilitate a dynamic creation, configuration, and execution of secure Web Service-based composed applications.zeige weniger",gnd:4832365-2 gnd:4261480-6
Analysis and manipulation of repetitive structures of varying shape,"Self-similarity and repetitions are ubiquitous in man-made and natural objects. Such structural regularities often relate to form, function, aesthetics, and design considerations. Discovering structural redundancies along with their dominant variations from 3D geometry not only allows us to better understand the underlying objects, but is also beneficial for several geometry processing tasks including compact representation, shape completion, and intuitive shape manipulation. - To identify these repetitions, we present a novel detection algorithm based on analyzing a graph of surface features. We combine general feature detection schemes with a RANSAC-based randomized subgraph searching algorithm in order to reliably detect recurring patterns of locally unique structures. A subsequent segmentation step based on a simultaneous region growing is applied to verify that the actual data supports the patterns detected in the feature graphs. We introduce our graph based detection algorithm on the example of rigid repetitive structure detection. Then we extend the approach to allow more general deformations between the detected parts. We introduce subspace symmetries whereby we characterize similarity by requiring the set of repeating structures to form a low dimensional shape space. We discover these structures based on detecting linearly correlated correspondences among graphs of invariant features. The found symmetries along with the modeled variations are useful for a variety of applications including non-local and non-rigid denoising. - Employing subspace symmetries for shape editing, we introduce a morphable part model for smart shape manipulation. The input geometry is converted to an assembly of deformable parts with appropriate boundary conditions. Our method uses self-similarities from a single model or corresponding parts of shape collections as training input and allows the user also to reassemble the identified parts in new configurations, thus exploiting both the discrete and continuous learned variations while ensuring appropriate boundary conditions across part boundaries. - We obtain an interactive yet intuitive shape deformation framework producing realistic deformations on classes of objects that are difficult to edit using repetition-unaware deformation techniques.",gnd:4042907-6 gnd:4040936-3 gnd:4006684-8

"Causes for slow weathering and erosion in the steep, warm, monsoon-subjected Highlands of Sri Lanka","In the Highlands of Sri Lanka, erosion and chemical weathering rates are among the lowest for global mountain denudation. In this tropical humid setting, highly weathered deep saprolite profiles have developed from high-grade metamorphic charnockite during spheroidal weathering of the bedrock. The spheroidal weathering produces rounded corestones and spalled rindlets at the rock-saprolite interface. I used detailed textural, mineralogical, chemical, and electron-microscopic (SEM, FIB, TEM) analyses to identify the factors limiting the rate of weathering front advance in the profile, the sequence of weathering reactions, and the underlying mechanisms. The first mineral attacked by weathering was found to be pyroxene initiated by in situ Fe oxidation, followed by in situ biotite oxidation. Bulk dissolution of the primary minerals is best described with a dissolution – re-precipitation process, as no chemical gradients towards the mineral surface and sharp structural boundaries are observed at the nm scale. Only the local oxidation in pyroxene and biotite is better described with an ion by ion process. The first secondary phases are oxides and amorphous precipitates from which secondary minerals (mainly smectite and kaolinite) form. Only for biotite direct solid state transformation to kaolinite is likely.

While hazard zonation mapping plays a vital role in identifying the vulnerable zones for future land-use planning activities, designing of early warning systems and adequate mitigation measures in landslide-prone areas, lack of real time early warnings significantly increases the damages world wide. Landslides associated with intense rain during monsoon and inter-monsoon seasons are the most pressing natural disaster in the Central Highland of Sri Lanka.

Constructing global stationary seismicity models from the long-term balance of interseismic strain measurements and earthquake-catalog data,"One third of the world's population lives in areas where earthquakes causing at least slight damage are frequently expected. Thus, the development and testing of global seismicity models is essential to improving seismic hazard estimates and earthquake-preparedness protocols for effective disaster-risk mitigation. Currently, the availability and quality of geodetic data along plate-boundary regions provides the opportunity to construct global models of plate motion and strain rate, which can be translated into global maps of forecasted seismicity. Moreover, the broad coverage of existing earthquake catalogs facilitates in present-day the calibration and testing of global seismicity models. As a result, modern global seismicity models can integrate two independent factors necessary for physics-based, long-term earthquake forecasting, namely interseismic crustal strain accumulation and sudden lithospheric stress release.

Electromechanics and Hydrodynamics of Single Vesicles and Vesicle Doublet Using Phase-Field Isogeometric Analysis,"Biomembranes are selectively permeable barriers that separate the internal components of the cell from its surroundings. They have remarkable mechanical behavior which is characterized by many phenomena, but most noticeably their fluid-like in-plane behavior and solid-like out-of-plane behavior. Vesicles have been studied in the context of discrete models, such as Molecular Dynamics, Monte Carlo methods, Dissipative Particle Dynamics, and Brownian Dynamics. Those methods, however, tend to have high computational costs, which limited their uses for studying atomistic details. In order to broaden the scope of this research, we resort to the continuum models, where the atomistic details of the vesicles are neglected, and the focus shifts to the overall morphological evolution. Under the umbrella of continuum models, vesicles morphology has been studied extensively. However, most of those studies were limited to the mechanical response of vesicles by considering only the bending energy and aiming for the solution by minimizing the total energy of the system. Most of the literature is divided between two geometrical representation methods; the sharp interface methods and the diffusive interface methods. Both of those methods track the boundaries and interfaces implicitly. In this research, we focus our attention on solving two non-trivial problems. In the first one, we study a constrained Willmore problem coupled with an electrical field, and in the second one, we investigate the hydrodynamics of a vesicle doublet suspended in an external viscous fluid flow.   For the first problem, we solve a constrained Willmore problem coupled with an electrical field using isogeometric analysis to study the morphological evolution of vesicles subjected to static electrical fields. The model comprises two phases, the lipid bilayer, and the electrolyte. This two-phase problem is modeled using the phase-field method, which is a subclass of the diffusive interface methods mentioned earlier. The bending, flexoelectric, and dielectric energies of the model are reformulated using the phase-field parameter. A modified Augmented-Lagrangian (ALM) approach was used to satisfy the constraints while maintaining numerical stability and a relatively large time step. This approach guarantees the satisfaction of the constraints at each time step over the entire temporal domain.   In the second problem, we study the hydrodynamics of vesicle doublet suspended in an external viscous fluid flow. Vesicles in this part of the research are also modeled using the phase-field model. The bending energy and energies associated with enforcing the global volume and area are considered. In addition, the local inextensibility condition is ensured by introducing an additional equation to the system. To prevent the vesicles from numerically overlapping, we deploy an interaction energy definition to maintain a short-range repulsion between the vesicles. The fluid flow is modeled using the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and the vesicle evolution in time is modeled using two advection equations describing the process of advecting each vesicle by the fluid flow. To overcome the velocity-pressure saddle point system, we apply the Residual-Based Variational MultiScale (RBVMS) method to the Navier-Stokes equations and solve the coupled systems using isogeometric analysis. We study vesicle doublet hydrodynamics in shear flow, planar extensional flow, and parabolic flow under various configurations and boundary conditions.   The results reveal several interesting points about the electrodynamics and hydrodynamics responses of single vesicles and vesicle doublets. But first, it can be seen that isogeometric analysis as a numerical tool has the ability to model and solve 4th-order PDEs in a primal variational framework at extreme efficiency and accuracy due to the abilities embedded within the NURBS functions without the need to reduce the order of the PDE by creating an intermediate environment. Refinement whether by knot insertion, order increasing or both is far easier to obtain than traditional mesh-based methods. Given the wide variety of phenomena in natural sciences and engineering that are mathematically modeled by high-order PDEs, the isogeometric analysis is among the most robust methods to address such problems as the basis functions can easily attain high global continuity.   On the applicational side, we study the vesicle morphological evolution based on the electromechanical liquid-crystal model in 3D settings. This model describing the evolution of vesicles is composed of time-dependent, highly nonlinear, high-order PDEs, which are nontrivial to solve. Solving this problem requires robust numerical methods, such as isogeometric analysis. We concluded that the vesicle tends to deform under increasing magnitudes of electric fields from the original sphere shape to an oblate-like shape. This evolution is affected by many factors and requires fine-tuning of several parameters, mainly the regularization parameter which controls the thickness of the diffusive interface width. But it is most affected by the method used for enforcing the constraints. The penalty method in presence of an electrical field tends to lock on the initial phase-field and prevent any evolution while a modified version of the ALM has proven to be sufficiently stable and accurate to let the phase-field evolve while satisfying the constraints over time at each time step. We show additionally the effect of including the flexoelectric nature of the Biomembranes in the computation and how it affects the shape evolution as well as the effect of having different conductivity ratios. All the examples were solved based on a staggered scheme, which reduces the computational cost significantly.   For the second part of the research, we consider vesicle doublet suspended in a shear flow, in a planar extensional flow, and in a parabolic flow. When the vesicle doublet is suspended in a shear flow, it can either slip past each other or slide on top of each other based on the value of the vertical displacement, that is the vertical distance between the center of masses between the two vesicles, and the velocity profile applied. When the vesicle doublet is suspended in a planar extensional flow in a configuration that resembles a junction, the time in which both vesicles separate depends largely on the value of the vertical displacement after displacing as much fluid from between the two vesicles. However, when the vesicles are suspended in a tubular channel with a parabolic fluid flow, they develop a parachute-like shape upon converging towards each other before exiting the computational domain from the predetermined outlets. This shape however is affected largely by the height of the tubular channel in which the vesicle is suspended. The velocity essential boundary conditions are imposed weakly and strongly. The weak implementation of the boundary conditions was used when the velocity profile was defined on the entire boundary, while the strong implementation was used when the velocity profile was defined on a part of the boundary. The strong implementation of the essential boundary conditions was done by selectively applying it to the predetermined set of elements in a parallel-based code.

Production Yield of Muon-Induced Neutrons in Lead : Measured at the Modane Underground Laboratory,"The work presented in this book is a major step towards understanding and eventually suppressing background in the direct search for dark matter particles scattering off germanium detectors. Although the flux of cosmic muons is reduced by many orders of magnitude in underground laboratories, the remaining energetic muons induce neutrons through various processes, neutrons that can potentially mimic a dark matter signal.This thesis describes the measurement of muon-induced neutrons over more than 3 years in the Modane underground laboratory. The data are complemented by a thorough modeling of the neutron signal using the GEANT4 simulation package, demonstrating the appropriateness of this tool to model these rare processes. As a result, a precise neutron production yield can be presented. Thus, future underground experiments will be able to reliably model the expected rate of muon-induced neutrons, making it possible to develop the necessary shielding concept to suppress this background component",gnd:4230260-2 gnd:4377866-5 gnd:4171638-3 gnd:4145879-5

An enhanced full waveform inversion method for the structural analysis of dams,"Since the Industrial Revolution in the 1700s, the high emission of gaseous wastes into the atmosphere from the usage of fossil fuels has caused a general increase in temperatures globally.  To combat the environmental imbalance, there is an increase in the demand for renewable energy sources. Dams play a major role in the generation of “green"" energy. However, these structures require frequent and strict monitoring to ensure safe and efficient operation.  To tackle the challenges faced in the application of convention dam monitoring techniques, this work proposes the inverse analysis of numerical models to identify damaged regions in the dam.  Using a dynamic coupled hydro-mechanical Extended Finite Element Method (XFEM) model and a global optimization strategy, damage (crack) in the dam is identified.  By employing seismic waves to probe the dam structure, a more detailed information on the distribution of heterogeneous materials and damaged regions are obtained by the application of the Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) method. The FWI is based on a local optimization strategy and thus it is highly dependent on the starting model. A variety of data acquisition setups are investigated, and an optimal setup is proposed. The effect of different starting models and noise in the measured data on the damage identification is considered.  Combining the non-dependence of a starting model of the global optimization strategy based dynamic coupled hydro-mechanical XFEM method and the detailed output of the local optimization strategy based FWI method, an enhanced Full Waveform Inversion is proposed for the structural analysis of dams.",gnd:4137313-3
Self-adaptive data quality : automating duplicate detection,"Carrying out business processes successfully is closely linked to the quality of the data inventory in an organization. Lacks in data quality lead to problems: Incorrect address data prevents (timely) shipments to customers. Erroneous orders lead to returns and thus to unnecessary effort. Wrong pricing forces companies to miss out on revenues or to impair customer satisfaction. If orders or customer records cannot be retrieved, complaint management takes longer. Due to erroneous inventories, too few or too much supplies might be reordered. A special problem with data quality and the reason for many of the issues mentioned above are duplicates in databases. Duplicates are different representations of same real-world objects in a dataset. However, these representations differ from each other and are for that reason hard to match by a computer. Moreover, the number of required comparisons to find those duplicates grows with the square of the dataset size. To cleanse the data, these duplicates must be detected and removed. Duplicate detection is a very laborious process. To achieve satisfactory results, appropriate software must be created and configured (similarity measures, partitioning keys, thresholds, etc.). Both requires much manual effort and experience. - This thesis addresses automation of parameter selection for duplicate detection and presents several novel approaches that eliminate the need for human experience in parts of the duplicate detection process. - [...]",gnd:1036653315 gnd:4139496-3 gnd:4011152-0
Progressive collapse in long-span cable-supported bridges,"['Parallel load-bearing systems are structural systems with load-bearing members that are similar in type and function and constitute alternative load paths. Cable-supported bridges are good examples of such a structural system. In the case of the failure of one of the parallel load-bearing elements (cables), the load carried by the failed member must be redistributed to the remaining structure. In this situation, the member adjacent to the failed member receives most of the redistributed load and becomes the critical member. If this member cannot tolerate the redistributed load, the collapse can progress to the subsequent members and, possibly, the entire structure. Hence, because of the vital role of the critical member in the robustness of the structural system, the focus of this study is mostly on this member. In this study, a parallel-load bearing system is considered as a conceptual model of long-span cable-supported bridges. The target is to calculate the “stress increase ratio” of the critical cablen a cable-loss scenario. The structural characteristics of the system, including the bending stiffness of the girder and a unique axial stiffness in each cable, have been taken into account. The failure of several cables has also been considered. An analytical approach based on differential equations of the system has been used, and an approximation function for the calculation of the stress increase ratio of the critical cable in a cable-loss scenario has been derived. The least squares method has been applied to minimize the error of the approximation function. The results show that by increasing the ratio of the bending stiffness of the girder to the axial stiffness of the cables (β-value), the stress increase ratio of the critical cable decreases. The acceptable accuracy of the presented approximation function has been proved by the comparison of the exact stress increase ratio values, and the one calculated from the proposed approximation function. Except for small β-values, the error of the proposed approximation function is less than 5% in the investigated systems. The developed approximation function has been used to derive a reserve-based robustness index. Besides, the structural robustness of a system segmented by zipper-stoppers has been investigated, and the stress increase ratio of the zipper-stopper in a cable-loss scenario has been examined. In addition, a similar approach for the calculation of the increase of maximum bending moment on the girder due to cable failure has been performed. The results show that by increasing the β-value, cable failure produces a larger bending moment on the girder. This means that for systems with smaller β-values, bending moments are smaller. Finally, a practical method for the optimization of cable distance in cable-supported bridges has been developed, and the optimum design of cable-supported bridges considering the failure of several cables has been investigated. The method minimizes the cost of bridge construction and guarantees a certain level of robustness.', 'Parallele Tragsysteme sind strukturelle Systeme mit tragenden Elementen, die in Art und Funktion ähnlich sind und alternative Lastspfade darstellen. Seilunterstützte Brücken sind gute Beispiele für ein solches Tragwerkssystem. Im Falle des Versagens eines der parallelen tragenden Elemente (Kabel) muss die Last, die von dem versagenden Element getragen wird, auf die verbleibende Struktur neu verteilt werden. In dieser Situation erhält das an das ausgefallene Element angrenzende Element den größten Teil der umverteilten Last und wird zum kritischen Element. Wenn dieses Element die umverteilte Last nicht ertragen kann, kann der Zusammenbruch auf die nachfolgenden Elemente und möglicherweise auf die gesamte Struktur übergreifen. Aufgrund der entscheidenden Rolle des kritischen Elements für die Robustheit des Tragwerksystems liegt der Schwerpunkt dieser Studie daher hauptsächlich auf diesem Element. In dieser Studie wird ein paralleles Tragsystem als ein konzeptionelles Modell für seilunterstützte Brücken mit großer Spannweite etrachtet. Das Ziel ist die Berechnung des ""Spannungszunahmeverhältnisses"" des kritischen Kabels in einem Kabelverlust-Szenario. Die strukturellen Eigenschaften des Systems, einschließlich der Biegesteifigkeit des Trägers und einer einzigartigen axialen Steifigkeit in jedem Kabel, wurden berücksichtigt. Das Versagen mehrerer Kabel wurde ebenfalls berücksichtigt. Ein analytischer Ansatz auf der Grundlage von Differentialgleichungen des Systems wurde verwendet, und es wurde eine Approximationsfunktion für die Berechnung des Spannungszunahmeverhältnisses des kritischen Kabels in einem Kabelverlustszenario abgeleitet. Die Methode der kleinsten Quadrate wurde angewandt, um den Fehler der Näherungsfunktion zu minimieren. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass durch Erhöhen des Verhältnisses der Biegesteifigkeit des Trägers zur axialen Steifigkeit der Kabel (β-Wert) das Spannungszunahmeverhältnis des kritischen Kabels abnimmt. Die akzeptable Genauigkeit der vorgestellten Approximationsfunktion wurde durch den Vergleich der genauen Werte des Spannungszunahmeverhältnisses mit dem aus der vorgeschlagenen Näherungsfunktion berechneten Wert nachgewiesen. Abgesehen von kleinen β-Werten beträgt der Fehler der vorgeschlagenen Näherungsfunktion in den untersuchten Systemen weniger als 5%. Die entwickelte Approximationsfunktion wurde verwendet, um einen reservebasierten Robustheitsindex abzuleiten. Außerdem wurde die strukturelle Robustheit eines durch Zipper-Stopper segmentierten Systems untersucht und das Spannungszunahmeverhältnis des Zipper-Stoppers in einem Kabelverlust-Szenario untersucht. Darüber hinaus wurde ein ähnlicher Ansatz für die Berechnung der Erhöhung des maximalen Biegemoments auf den Träger aufgrund von Kabelversagen durchgeführt. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass ein Kabelversagen durch Erhöhung des β-Wertes ein größeres Biegemoment auf den Träger erzeugt. Dies bedeutet, dass bei Systemen mit kleineren β-Werten die Biegemomente kleiner sind. Schließlich wurde eine praktische Methode zur Optimierung des Kabelabstands in seilunterstützten Brücken entwickelt, und es wurde die optimale Auslegung von seilunterstützten Brücken unter Berücksichtigung des Versagens mehrerer Kabel untersucht. Die Methode minimiert die Kosten der Brückenkonstruktion und garantiert eine gewisse Robustheit.']",gnd:4162960-7

Investigating the pore structure of blended cement with synchrotron microtomography,"Zusammenfassung: Supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) such as fly ash and slag are exten- sively used as mineral substitutes in cement and concrete production, owing to the lower energy consumption and reduced CO2 emission. The pore structure of such cement pastes plays an important role during hydration and, ultimately, durability.In this work, the pore structures of blended cement paste were investigated as a func- tion of hydration time and blending types by means of high resolution synchrotron tomography. Image processing algorithms are explored and their suitability for pore structure characterization is evaluated. The extracted data with respect to the pore features (volume, surface area, equivalent diameter, etc.) can then be summarized and described by box plots. Specifically, a modified box plot with a plateau indi- cating the systematic error is introduced to assess the segmentation precision. The applicability and robustness of this approach is evaluated using different sample sets and experiments. Further, durability and mass transport are examined by analysis the total pore volume and the effective connected pore-cluster.As a result of this work, synchrotron based microtomography is identified as a promising method for the study of pore structure in blended cements. The image processing algorithms are proven to have a low error level, and systematic errors in the examined pastes are in the same order as the corresponding stochastic er- rors. The results indicate that cement pastes benefit from SCMs in microstructure development. Moreover, moist environment has a significant refinement of pore structure. In particular, the average pore volume is up to ten times smaller than for conventional sealed cement pastes. A nonparametric approach to the segmentation systematic errors for the pore structure qualification of blended cement pastes is established",gnd:4190687-1 gnd:4113240-3 gnd:4184235-2
Trapped atomic ions for fundamental studies of closed and open quantum systems,"Abstract: Any realistic quantum system interacts with its environment. While this leads to inadvertent perturbations in many applications, this interaction lies at the heart of countless interesting phenomena. Trapped atomic ions are well suited to study quantum dynamics on a fundamental level. They feature  extensive control in preparation, coherent manipulation, and detection of internal (electronic) and external (motional) degrees of freedom. In addition, they allow for a remarkable degree of isolation from their surroundings. In this thesis, we use a trapped-ion setup to experimentally compose and study specific open and closed quantum systems. Starting with a single magnesium ion, we introduce an incoherent interaction with a large environment to tailor an open quantum system. We demonstrate that the fast and substantial impact of decoherence can be exploited to devise a high-precision spectroscopy method with sensitivity to single photons. We measure one-, two-, and three-photon transitions in 25Mg+ with a relative frequency uncertainty below 5 x 10^(-9), making our results relevant for the interpretation of astrophysical data in the search of spatial and temporal variations of the fine structure constant. Further, in a bottom up approach, we use a hybrid ion crystal of magnesium isotopes to construct a nearly closed quantum system atom by atom. We choose a subsystem of interest and realize a tunable degree of isolation from the rest of the closed system to study properties of the (open) subsystem. By the deliberate disregard of correlations and coherences through the measurement of subsystem observables, we  find evidence of  equilibration and thermalization, despite the underlying unitary dynamics of the total system. We study their dependence on the engineered  size of the environment and the  controlled strength of the interaction, where the coherent evolution explores Hilbert space dimensions exceeding 10^6. Our time-resolved measurements demonstrate finite-size effects as well as the transition to mesoscopic system dynamics and highlight the importance of associated time scales. Our setup can be extended by addition of spins and bosonic degrees of freedom, preparation of arbitrary internal and external states and initial correlations, and full state tomography. This paves the way, both for the study of open and closed system dynamics and their properties, and for an analogue quantum simulator for various  model systems",gnd:4300046-0 gnd:4297078-7 gnd:4246725-1

Mechanochemical processes in energetic materials : a computational and experimental investigation,"This book uses experimental and computational methods to rationalize and predict for the first time the relative impact sensitivities of a range of energetic materials.

As such, the book paves the way for a new, fully ab initio approach for the design of safer energetic materials based solely on knowledge of their solid-state structures. Energetic materials (explosives, propellants, gas generators, and pyrotechnics) are defined as materials that release heat and/or gaseous products at a high rate upon stimulus by heat, impact, shock, sparks, etc. They have widespread military and civilian uses, including munitions, mining, quarrying, demolition, emergency signaling, automotive safety, and space exploration.

"Glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs) and GPI-anchored proteins tethered to lipid bilayers : modelling a complex interplay of carbohydrates, proteins and lipids","Glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs) are highly complex glycolipids that serve as membrane anchors to a large variety of eukaryotic proteins. These are covalently attached to a group of peripheral proteins called GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) through a post-translational modification in the endoplasmic reticulum. The GPI anchor is a unique structure composed of a glycan, with phospholipid tail at one end and a phosphoethanolamine linker at the other where the protein attaches. The glycan part of the GPI comprises a conserved pseudopentasaccharide core that could branch out to carry additional glycosyl or phosphoethanolamine units. GPI-APs are involved in a diverse range of cellular processes, few of which are signal transduction, protein trafficking, pathogenesis by protozoan parasites like the malaria- causing parasite Plasmodium falciparum.

Facies and aquifer characterization of the German triassic Buntsandstein in central Germany,"The Lower Triassic Buntsandstein in the Hesse Trough and in the Thuringian Syncline is a major aquifer in Thuringia and adjacent areas. The depositional system is characterized by a playa-lake to lake setting with some aeolian phases in the Lower Buntsandstein and fluvial, sandflat, and lacustrine to aeolian deposits in the Middle Buntsandstein. The aim of the study is to understand the influence of small-scale facies heterogeneities on fluid-flow pathways. For this purpose Lithofacies Types and Associations in outcrops and cores were studied and statistically characterized, with special emphasis on the thickness, depth and width ratios of architectural elements as well as of inclination and orientation of bounding surfaces. To predict aquifer qualities, the spatial distribution and connectivity in relation to variations in petrophysical properties (porosity and permeability) were studied. With the exception of aeolian deposits, especially Facies Associations with poor petrophysical properties have a wide lateral distribution. This indicates that potential barriers, while thin, show a wider lateral continuity than potential aquifers. Based on this dataset small-scale generic 3D-models of different depositional environments were developed, and fluid flow pathways with regard to the sedimentary structures were modelled. Results show that sedimentary structures influence the fluid flow only in the case of high differences in permeability, e.g. in sand layers intercalated in muds. Minor permeability differences within sedimentary units only slow down fluid flow, but do not cause deviations from the flow direction.",gnd:4180608-6 gnd:4022375-9 gnd:4016568-1 gnd:4009081-4

Live cell STED microscopy using genetically encoded markers,"Far-field fluorescence microscopy is a tool of outstanding importance in the biological sciences, due to its non-invasiveness especially for the investigation of living cells, tissue and animals. Today also the major drawback in light microscopy, namely its limited resolution, has been overcome by utilizing photoswitching between different states of the fluorophore. STimulated Emission Depletion (STED) microscopy was the first farfield fluoresence nanoscopy approach to evolve, offering images with a resolution far beyond the diffraction barrier. However, until now STED microscopy was mostly confined to imaging fixed and therefore dead samples, because immunocytochemistry, the method of choice for fluorescence labeling for STED microscopy, requires in most cases the permeabilization and therefore fixation of the specimen. In this work, STED microscopy in living cells has been established.

Individual nodes will be equipped with a spectroscopic system based on (Cd,Zn)Te detectors. REWARD on the other hand aims for a mobile network, that can be used for the identification and localization of radioactive sources. However, the production of (Cd,Zn)Te suffers from low yield due to defects. This means that only a limited amount of material is available for detector fabrication.

Deformation mechanisms in pure and alloyed copper films,"In this work, the evolution of microstructure and the thermo-mechanical behavior of cop-per and dilute copper alloy thin films was investigated. 0.3 to 2.0 æm thick films were de-posited by magnetron sputtering under ultra high vacuum conditions onto diffusion-barrier coated silicon substrates and subjected to wafer curvature measurements. Pure copper films annealed in ultra high vacuum exhibited a large grain size, a sharp (111) texture, and very few twin grains. Grain growth in the single-phase copper-aluminum system was similar to that in pure copper films; abnormal grain growth and inhibition of normal grain growth was observed in the two-phase copper-yttrium system. The thermal stress evolution in pure copper films was described for the first time with a constitutive law for diffusional creep in a thin film under the constraint of a substrate. Diffusional creep was suppressed by aluminum alloying. This was accounted for by the in-hibition of surface diffusion due to a segregation layer of aluminum oxide. Creep voiding occurred in oxidized copper-aluminum alloy films. Creep voiding, which was observed for the first time in a two-dimensional grain structure, was ascribed to the high thermal stresses, which cannot be avoided in the heat treatment of metal films on silicon substrates.",gnd:4194417-3 gnd:4033748-0 gnd:4136925-7 gnd:4033734-0 gnd:4217961-0 gnd:4131028-7

"Urban planning and everyday urbanisation : a case study on Bahir Dar, Ethiopia","Urbanisation in Bahir Dar, Ethiopia, poses challenges to urban living conditions. Despite large scale housing programmes from the side of the government, construction and settling processes have largely remained incremental. Nadine Appelhans focuses on the relation between statutory planning and practices of everyday urbanisation. The findings from Bahir Dar suggest that some mundane regimes of building the city are patronised, while others are considered undesired by policy makers. Based on this insight, the author argues that urban development in Bahir Dar needs to be locally grounded, differentiated and inclusive to avoid further tendencies of segregation.

Ionothermal carbon materials : advanced synthesis and electrochemical applications,"Alternative concepts for energy storage and conversion have to be developed, optimized and employed to fulfill the dream of a fossil-independent energy economy. Porous carbon materials play a major role in many energy-related devices. Among different characteristics, distinct porosity features, e.g., specific surface area (SSA), total pore volume (TPV), and the pore size distribution (PSD), are important to maximize the performance in the final device. In order to approach the aim to synthesize carbon materials with tailor-made porosity in a sustainable fashion, the present thesis focused on biomass-derived precursors employing and developing the ionothermal carbonization. During the ionothermal carbonization, a salt melt simultaneously serves as solvent and porogen. Typically, eutectic mixtures containing zinc chloride are employed as salt phase. The first topic of the present thesis addressed the possibility to precisely tailor the porosity of ionothermal carbon materials by an experimentally simple variation of the molar composition of the binary salt mixture. The developed pore tuning tool allowed the synthesis of glucose derived carbon materials with predictable SSAs in the range of ~ 900 to ~ 2100 m2 g-1. Moreover, the nucleobase adenine was employed as precursor introducing nitrogen functionalities in the final material. Thereby, the chemical properties of the carbon materials are varied leading to new application fields. Nitrogen doped carbons (NDCs) are able to catalyze the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) which takes place on the cathodic site of a fuel cell. The herein developed porosity tailoring allowed the synthesis of adenine derived NDCs with outstanding SSAs of up to 2900 m2 g-1 and very large TPV of 5.19 cm3 g-1....",gnd:4046811-2 gnd:4031677-4
Modeling non-linear dynamic phenomena in biochemical networks,"Facilitated by the development of high-throughput techniques, the focus of biological research has changed in the last decades from the investigation of single cell components to a system-level approach, which aims at an understanding of interactions between these cell components. This objective requires modeling and analysis methods for these regulatory networks. In this thesis, we investigate mechanisms causing qualitative dynamic behaviors of regulatory subsystems. For this purpose, we introduce a differential equation model based on underlying molecular binding reactions, whose parameters are estimated using time series concentration data. In the first part, the model is applied to subsystems with qualitatively different dynamic behaviors: The response of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis to DNA damages is described as the relaxation of a system to its steady state after external perturbation. Specific repression of genes in Escherichia coli by the global regulator protein H-NS is explained by the interrelation of feedback mechanisms. In order to prevent overfitting, a typical problem in network inference from experimental data, we introduce an approach based on Bayesian statistics, which includes prior knowledge about the system in terms of prior probability distributions ...",gnd:4122166-7 gnd:4126142-2 gnd:4701615-2 gnd:4171529-9 gnd:4122930-7

Die beschriebenen Merkmale hatten Auswirkungen sowohl auf die Wachstumsparameter und Züchtungsregime als auch auf die Qualität der Silizium-Kristalle. Das erste Kapitel befasste sich mit verschiedenen thermodynamischen Facetten des epitaktischen Nanodrahtwachstums. Nach einleitenden Worten zum Wachstumsmechanismus wurde zunächst die Berechnung von binären Phasendiagrammen vorgestellt, da die den Phasendiagrammen zugrundeliegenden Phasenverhältnisse wesentlich das Drahtwachstum beeinflussen. Mit diesen Formalismen war es möglich, die Temperaturübergänge zwischen festen und flüssigen Phasen nanoskopischer Katalysatorgemische zu berechnen. Im nächsten Abschnitt des Theoriekapitels wurde besonders auf das epitaktische Drahtwachstum eingegangen und dem damit verbundenen Phänomen der Drahtbasisverbreiterung. Das Nebol’sin-Stabilitätskriterium wurde für das Wachstum von Silizium-Drähten um die Oberflächenenergieeinflüsse des Drahtsockels erweitert. Damit konnte man allgemeine Vorhersagen für die Wachstumsstabilität epitaktischer Drähte, die mit unterschiedlichen Katalysatoren gewachsen wurden, treffen. Im Anschluss wurden anhand realer Sockelquerschnitte Abschätzungen der Übersättigungsveränderungen in Folge der sich verändernden Drahtformen gegeben. Das experimentelle Kapitel wurde mit der allgemeinen Beschreibung des Drahtzüchtungsaufbaus, der Substratreinigungsprozedur und der Wachstumsgasanalyse eingeleitet. Danach wurde Drahtwachstum mit dem Standardkatalysator Gold, mit dem Ziel großflächig geordnete Strukturen vertikaler Nanodrähte zu erhalten, vorgestellt. Eine vollständige Vertikalität konnte vermutlich aufgrund von Einflüssen der Oxidmaske nicht erreicht werden. Im zweiten Wachstumsabschnitt wurde die epitaktische Kristallzüchtung ultra-dünner Nanodrähte mit festem Silber als Katalysator dargestellt. Ein Vorteil von Silber als Katalysator im Vergleich zu Gold war eine effektive Metallentfernung nach dem Wachstum. Der letzte Abschnitt des Züchtungskapitels befasste sich mit der Silizium-Nanodrahtherstellung mit Palladium-Nanopartikeln als Proto-Katalysatoren.

Image-based approaches to hair modeling,"Hair is a relevant characteristic of virtual characters, therefore the modeling of plausible facial hair and hairstyles is an essential step in the generation of computer generated (CG) avatars. However, the inherent geometric complexity of hair together with the huge number of filaments of an average human head make the task of modeling hairstyles a very challenging one. To date this is commonly a manual process which requires artist skills or very specialized and costly acquisition software. In this work we present an image-based approach to model facial hair (beard and eyebrows) and (head) hairstyles. Since facial hair is usually much shorter than the average head hair two different methods are resented, adapted to the characteristics of the hair to be modeled. Facial hair is modeled using data extracted from facial texture images and missing information is inferred by means of a database-driven prior model. Our hairstyle reconstruction technique employs images of the hair to be modeled taken with a thermal camera. The major advantage of our thermal image-based method over conventional image-based techniques lies on the fact that during data capture the hairstyle is ""lit from the inside"": the thermal camera captures heat irradiated by the head and actively re-emitted by the hair filaments almost isotropically. Following this approach we can avoid several issues of conventional image-based techniques, like shadowing or anisotropy in reflectance. The presented technique requires minimal user interaction and a simple acquisition setup. Several challenging examples demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach.",gnd:7576897-5 gnd:4006684-8
Micromechanical modeling of size-dependent crystal plasticity and deformation twinning,"['The computational modeling and simulation of the deformation behavior of crystalline materials at the micron scale is the objective of this thesis. Numerous experimental studies have proven that small-scaled metallic probes behave mechanically different from their bulk counterparts, in particular, the yield strength and work hardening behavior is affected in the way that smaller single crystals behave stronger. This characteristic behavior opens up new design possibilities for further improvement of mechanical properties of engineering material systems. In view of high expenses for advanced and complex experimental work along with the inherent testing limitations, numerical methods offer a great option to validate experimental findings, support the development of suitable theories, and extend scientific investigations on a computer-aided basis. A gradient crystal plasticity model is presented in this thesis and applied to selected scientific problems including the mechanical testing of single crystals via simulation of microcompression and microbending using a three-dimensional finite element framework. The model is implemented on an element basis and linked to the commercial finite element software Abaqus via the user subroutine UEL. Two major deformation mechanism are considered by the underlying model. Deformation via crystallographic slip is modeled in a non-local fashion allowing to account for gradient effects. Geometrically necessary dislocation (GND) densities associated with plastic slip gradients are introduced as additional nodal degrees of freedom while the actual plastic slip variables are handled as internal variables. Deformation twinning is accounted for in terms of a simple shear deformation associated with shear and shuffling of atoms. In addition, the twinning-induced reorientation of the crystal lattice is fully considered along with subsequent activation of slip modes within the twinned region. In accordance to the non-local crystal plasticity framework, the gradient of the twin volume fraction is introduced at the nodal level. The actual twin volume fraction is treated as an extended internal variable yielding a coupled system of highly non-linear equations at the local level. The competitive nature between slip deformation and deformation by twinning is addressed by physically motivated interaction relations. The characteristic features of the model are portrayed for a variety of micromechanical problems and in relation to experimental results.', 'Gegenstand dieser Arbeit ist die Modellierung und Simulation des Deformationsverhaltens von kristallinen Werkstoffen auf der Mikroskala. Diverse experimentelle Studien haben bewiesen, dass sich das mechanische Materialverhalten von kleinskaligen Metallproben gegenüber großskaligen Proben unterscheidet, insbesondere hinsichtlich der Fließgrenze und des Verfestigungsverhaltens. Dabei verhalten sich kleinere Einkristalle fester und zäher als größere. Dieses charakteristische Verhalten eröffnet neue Gestaltungsmöglichkeiten zur weiteren Verbesserung von mechanischen Eigenschaften technischer Materialsysteme. Ein Gradienten-basiertes Kristallplastizitätsmodell wird im Rahmen dieser Arbeit präsentiert und basierend auf einer dreidimensionalen Finite-Elemente Implementierung auf ausgewählte wissenschaftliche Problemstellungen angewendet. Die Implementierung des Modells erfolgt hierbei mittels einer Benutzerroutine welche auf Element-Ebene in die kommerzielle Finite-Elemente Software Abaqus integriert wird. Schwerpunkt dieser Arbeit ist die numerische Simulation von mechanischen Prüfverfahren, darunter die Mikrokompression und Mikrobiegung von einkristallinen metallischen Werkstoffen. Die Modellierung von Versetzungsgleitung erfolgt durch einen nichtlokalen Ansatz, wodurch die Abbildung von Gradienteneffekten ermöglicht wird. Geometrisch notwendige Versetzungsdichten, assoziiert mit Gradienten der plastischen Gleitung, werden hierbei als zusätzliche Knoten-Freiheitsgrade eingeführt wohingegen die Gleitsystem-bezogenen plastischen Scherungen interne Variablen darstellen. Verformungszwillingsbildung beschreibt die Scherung und Umsortierung von Atomen und wird in Form einer einfachen Scherdeformation abgebildet. Darüber hinaus wird die dabei induzierte Reorientierung des Kristallgitters vollständig berücksichtigt und eine anschließende Aktivierung von Gleitmoden innerhalb verzwillingter Regionen zugelassen.

Thermodynamics of Information Processing in Small Systems,"This thesis presents a general theory of nonequilibrium thermodynamics for information processing.  Ever since Maxwell's demon was proposed in the nineteenth century, the relationship between thermodynamics and information has attracted much attention because it concerns the foundation of the second law of thermodynamics.  From the modern point of view, Maxwell's demon is formulated as an information processing device that performs measurement and feedback at the level of thermal fluctuations.  By unifying information theory, measurement theory, and the recently developed theory of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, the author has constructed a theory of 'information thermodynamics,' in which information contents and thermodynamic variables are treated on an equal footing.  In particular, the maximum work that can be extracted by the demon and the minimum work that is needed for measurement and information erasure by  the demon has been determined.  Additionally, generalizations of nonequilibrium relations such as a Jarzynski equality for classical stochastic systems in the presence of feedback control have been derived.  One of the generalized equalities has recently been verified experimentally by using sub-micron colloidal particles. The results obtained serve as fundamental principles for information processing in small thermodynamic systems, and are applicable to nanomachines and nanodevices.",gnd:4130850-5 gnd:4026927-9
Measurement of the D0 Meson Production in Pb–Pb and p–Pb Collisions : A Study Performed with the ALICE Experiment at the LHC,"['This thesis presents the first measurement of charmed D0 meson production relative to the reaction plane in Pb–Pb collisions at the center-of-mass energy per nucleon-nucleon collision of √sNN = 2.76 TeV. It also showcases the measurement of the D0 production in p–Pb collisions at √sNN = 5.02 TeV with the ALICE detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The measurement of the D0 azimuthal anisotropy with respect to the reaction plane indicates that low- momentum charm quarks participate in the collective expansion of the high-density, strongly interacting medium formed in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions, despite their large mass. This behavior can be explained by charm hadronization via recombination with light quarks from the medium and collisional energy loss. The measurement of the D0 production in p–Pb collisions is crucial to separate the effect induced by cold nuclear matter from the final- state effects induced by the hot medium formed in Pb–Pb collisions. The D0 production in p–Pb collisions is consistent with the binary collision scaling of the production in pp collisions, demonstrating that the modification of the momentum distribution observed in Pb–Pb collisions with respect to pp is predominantly induced by final-state effects such as the charm energy loss.', 'Introduction -- Physics of Ultra-Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collisions -- Heavy-Flavour Probes in Heavy-Ion Collisions -- The ALICE Experiment at the LHC -- Experimental Observables -- D0 → K−π+ Decay Reconstruction -- Systematic Uncertainties -- Azimuthal Anisotropy of D0 Production in Pb–Pb Collisions -- D0 Production in p–Pb Collisions -- Conclusions.']",gnd:4260998-7 gnd:4224891-7 gnd:4239869-1 gnd:4137643-2 gnd:4369112-2 gnd:4398783-7 gnd:4116451-9 gnd:7660423-8 gnd:4314771-9 gnd:4185932-7

However, this leaves open the question how to handle procedures for which a final ruling cannot yet be reached.

Computational virtual measurement for trees,"National forest inventory (NFI) is a systematic sampling method to collect forest information, including tree parameters, site conditions, and auxiliary data. The sample plot measurement is the key work in NFI. However, compared to the techniques 100 years ago, measuring methods and data-processing (modeling) approaches for NFI sample plots have been improved to a minor extent. The limit was that the newly-developed methods introduced additional validation workflows and would increase the workload in NFI. That was due to that these methods were usually developed based on species-specific and site-specific strategies. In order to overcome these obstacles, the integration of the novel measuring instruments is in urgent need, e.g., light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and the corresponding data processing methods with NFI. Given these situations, this thesis proposed a novel computational virtual measurement (CVM) method for the determination of tree parameters without the need for validation. Primarily, CVM is a physical simulation method and works as a virtual measuring instrument. CVM measures raw data, e.g., LiDAR point clouds and tree models, by the simulation of the physical mechanism of measuring instruments and natural phenomena. Based on the theory of CVM, this thesis is a systematic description of how to develop virtual measuring instruments. The first work is to introduce the CVM theory. CVM is a conceptual and general methodology, which is different from a specific measurement of tree parameters. Then, the feasibility of CVM was tested using a conceptual implementation, i.e., virtual ruler. The development of virtual ruler demonstrated the two key differences between CVM and conventional modeling methods. Firstly, the research focus of CVM is to build an appropriate physical scenario instead of finding a mathematical relationship between modeling results and true values. Secondly, the CVM outputs can approach true values, whereas the modeling results could not. Consequently, in a virtual space, tree parameters are determined by a measuring process without mathematical predictions. Accordingly, the result is free of validation and can be regarded as true values, at least in virtual spaces. With the knowledge from the virtual ruler development, two exceptional implementations are further developed. They are the virtual water displacement (VWD) method and sunlight analysis method. Both of them employ the same CVM workflow, which is firstly measured in reality and secondly measured in virtual space. The VWD aims to virtually measure the point clouds using the simulation of water displacement methods in reality. There are two stages in this method. The first stage is to apply the simulation of water displacement using massive virtual water molecules (VWMs). Some empirical regressions have to be employed in this stage, due to the limitation of computer performance. In the second stage, a single (or few) VWM (or VWMs) is developed to remove those empirical processes in VWD. Finally, VWD can function as a fully automatic method to measure point clouds.The sunlight analysis method aims to virtually measure the tree models using the simulation of solar illumination during daylight. There are also two stages in this method. The first stage is to develop sunlight analysis for a single tree. The second stage is to analyze the interference from neighboring trees. The results include default tree attributes, which can be collected in the future NFI. The successful developments of CVM, along with implementations of VWD and sunlight analysis methods, prove the initial assumptions in this thesis. It is the conversion of mathematical processing of data into virtual measurements. Accordingly, this is a different philosophy, i.e., the role of data is extended to the digital representative of trees. It opens an avenue of data processing using a more natural approach and is expected to be employed in the near future as a standard measuring instrument, such as a diameter tape, in NFI.",gnd:4148259-1 gnd:4075677-4 gnd:4064394-3
Ein phasenauflösendes Seegangsmodell zur Ermittlung von Bemessungsparametern für Küstenstrukturen,"['Small-area high resolution numerical models, reproducing the kinematics of the sea surface in the vicinity of coastal structures like beaches and dykes are in the focus of this thesis. Comparing accuracy and numerical efficiency a class of equations, termed Boussinesq wave equations, is most suitable in providing time dependent and spatial wave Information for shallow and intermediate water depth.In Boussinesq models a 2D-horizontal set of equations is solved; but the Boussinesq approach assumes velocity functions over the water depth in the three directions. The reconstruction of quasi-3D velocity distributions at each time step of computation is analysed. The description of breaking waves is decisive for the use of Boussinesq wave models in surfzones. The discussed model includes a new and more complex Extended-Eddy-Viscosity-Concept in order to determine with higher accuracy the wave breaking point, the decreasing wave hight and shape-describing parameters such as asymmetry and skewness. The developed Wet-Slope is a new strategy that allows to determine spatial wave runup and the water volume associated with overtopping as additional coastal engineering parameters of a Boussinesq wave model.A comparison with various laboratory data has been carried out. Finally the model has been applied to a real beach in front of an island, located in the Norm Sea. The requirements from a numerical wave modelling point of view regarding a spatial quasi-continuous measurement technique are discussed.', 'Im Mittelpunkt der vorliegenden Arbeit steht die phasenauflösende numerische Modellierung der Seegangstransformation im Nahfeld von Küstenstrukturen wie Stränden und Deichen.

Zum Einfluss der Nachbehandlung auf die Gefügeausbildung und den Frost-Taumittelwiderstand der Betonrandzone,"['The hardening of cement concrete is based on the chemical reaction of cement and water. Therefore, the ensuring of sufficient amount of water in concrete is essential. All these measures are referred as curing of concrete. This dissertation provides a basic consideration of curing of concrete for concrete pavements. In this regard the using of cements with slow strength development, e.g. cements with blast furnace slag is the main topic. The effectiveness of curing was evaluated on the basis of the freeze-thaw de-icing resistance and the microstructure of hardened outer concrete surface. Concrete surfaces with textured mortar are on the focus. The results were used to develope a model of the drying of young concrete. It could be shown, that the outer concrete surface does not dry during the first drying phase (called capillary phase). Instead the concrete is drying evenly over the high of the concrete sample during the capillary drying phase. A fast drying of the outer concrete surface only takes place after the capillary drying phase. Based on all results a nomogram (for road concrete) was created for an estimation of the duration of the capillary drying phase. If there is no curing after the capillary drying phase the concrete with use of slowly reacting cement has a great risk for a harmful drying of outer concrete surface. In this case such a concrete shows a very poor freeze thaw de-icing resistance. By using cements with a 2 day-compressive strength ≥ 23,0 N/mm² a good freeze thaw de-icing resistance could assure, despite no or a poor curing was applied. This criterion can be used to estimate the usability of cements with granulated blast furnace slag when a great freeze thaw de-icing resistance is essential. There could also be used a cement with lower 2 day-compressive strength. In this case a good curing has to be assured. Spraying of liquid curing compounds according to TL NBM-StB is suitable for curing concrete pavements. The curing compound should not be sprayed on a concrete surface with any visible water film. The effectiveness of curing compounds is equal to a five days long wet curing in consideration of applying the curing compound at the right time. Otherwise there is some negative influence when the spraying of curing compounds starts too early. Consideration about the right application time of curing compounds is more important for low temperatures because the concrete bleeds much longer due to the slower cement reaction at low temperatures. It was possible to create a numerical model which accounts the interaction between drying, curing and development of microstructure by providing hydration dependent transport parameters (water transport in concrete). The model was used for a parameter study. It could be shown that the combination of cements with slow strength development and low ambient temperatures leads to a thin surface zone (500 µm – 1000 µm) with very high capillary porosity.', 'Die Festigkeitsentwicklung des Zementbetons basiert auf der chemischen Reaktion des Zementes mit dem Anmachwasser. Durch Nachbehandlungsmaßnahmen muss dafür gesorgt werden, dass dem Zement genügend Wasser für seine Reaktion zur Verfügung steht, da sonst ein Beton mit minderer Qualität entsteht. Die vorliegende Arbeit behandelt die grundsätzlichen Fragen der Betonnachbehandlung bei Anwendung von Straßenbetonen. Im Speziellen wird die Frage des erforderlichen Nachbehandlungsbedarfs von hüttensandhaltigen Kompositzementen betrachtet. Die Wirkung der Nachbehandlung wird anhand des erreichten Frost-Tausalz-Widerstandes und der Gefügeausbildung in der unmittelbaren Betonrandzone bewertet. Der Fokus der Untersuchungen lag auf abgezogenen Betonoberflächen. Es wurde ein Modell zur Austrocknung des jungen Betons erarbeitet. Es konnte gezeigt werden, dass in einer frühen Austrocknung (Kapillarphase) keine kritische Austrocknung der Betonrandzone einsetzt, sondern der Beton annährend gleichmäßig über die Höhe austrocknet. Es wurde ein Nomogramm entwickelt, mit dem die Dauer der Kapillarphase in Abhängigkeit der Witterung für Straßenbetone abgeschätzt werden kann. Eine kritische Austrocknung der wichtigen Randzone setzt nach Ende der Kapillarphase ein. Für Betone unter Verwendung von Zementen mit langsamer Festigkeitsentwicklung ist die Austrocknung der Randzone nach Ende der Kapillarphase besonders ausgeprägt. Im Ergebnis zeigen diese Betone dann einen geringen Frost-Tausalz-Widerstand. Mit Zementen, die eine 2d-Zementdruckfestigkeit ≥ 23,0 N/mm² aufweisen, wurde unabhängig von der Zementart (CEM I oder CEM II/B-S) auch dann ein hoher Frost-Tausalz-Widerstand erreicht, wenn keine oder eine schlechtere Nachbehandlung angewendet wurde. Für die Praxis ergibt sich damit eine einfache Möglichkeit der Vorauswahl von geeigneten Zementen für den Verkehrsflächenbau. Betone, die unter Verwendung von Zementen mit langsamere Festigkeitsentwicklung hergestellt werden, erreichen einen hohen Frost-Tausalz-Widerstand nur mit einer geeigneten Nachbehandlung. Die Anwendung von flüssigen Nachbehandlungsmitteln (NBM gemäß TL NBM-StB) erreicht eine ähnliche Wirksamkeit wie eine 5 tägige Feuchtnachbehandlung. Voraussetzung für die Wirksamkeit der NBM ist, dass sie auf eine Betonoberfläche ohne sichtbaren Feuchtigkeitsfilm (feuchter Glanz) aufgesprüht werden. Besonders wichtig ist die Beachtung des richtigen Auftragszeitpunktes bei kühler Witterung, da hier aufgrund der verlangsamten Zementreaktion der Beton länger Anmachwasser abstößt. Ein zu früher Auftrag des Nachbehandlungsmittels führt zu einer Verschlechterung der Qualität der Betonrandzone. Durch Bereitstellung hydratationsabhängiger Transportkenngrößen (Feuchtetransport im Beton) konnten numerische Berechnungen zum Zusammenspiel zwischen der Austrocknung, der Nachbehandlung und der Gefügeentwicklung durchgeführt werden. Mit dem erstellten Berechnungsmodell wurden Parameterstudien durchgeführt. Die Berechnungen bestätigen die wesentlichen Erkenntnisse der Laboruntersuchungen. Darüber hinaus lässt sich mit dem Berechnungsmodell zeigen, dass gerade bei langsam reagierenden Zementen und kühler Witterung ohne eine Nachbehandlung eine sehr dünne Randzone (ca. 500 µm – 1000 µm) mit stark erhöhter Kapillarporosität entsteht.']",gnd:4193125-7 gnd:4228869-1 gnd:4006111-5 gnd:4067574-9

Causal inference in multilevel designs,"The general theory of causal effects (Steyer et al., 2009) is used to develop a theory of causal inference for multilevel designs - i.e., for designs in which the effects of treatments are evaluated on units nested within clusters - that extends and consolidates previous approaches. Two multilevel causality spaces for different classes of multilevel designs are used to define true-effect variables, average causal effects, conditional causal effects and prima-facie effects. Unbiasedness, as the weakest condition under which average and conditional causal effects are identified, and its sufficient conditions are outlined. Next, stability assumptions for causal inference in multilevel designs are discussed in relation to the general theory of causal effects and a taxonomy of multilevel designs is introduced. Building upon this theoretical framework, the generalized analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), that extends the conventional multilevel ANCOVA by identifying the average causal effect in the presence of interactions, is developed for non-randomized multilevel designs with treatment assignment at unit- and at the cluster-level. Two simulation studies tested several statistical implementations of the generalized ANCOVAs. The results showed that contextual effects have to be taken into account in the specification of adjustment models, that predictors have to be modeled as stochastic to obtain correct standard errors of the average causal effects and that the unreliability of the empirical cluster means has to be accounted for in designs with treatment assignment at the cluster-level. The statistical methods studied in the simulations were applied to two empirical examples from educational research to demonstrate the implementations in practice. Finally, the scope of the general theory of causal effects, the advantages and disadvantages of the generalized ANCOVA and alternative adjustment methods are discussed and an overview of further research needs is given.",gnd:4059787-8 gnd:4030102-3 gnd:4197017-2 gnd:4129240-6 gnd:4116599-8 gnd:4144322-6

The cultural evolution of coinage as an informational system,"The invention of coined money significantly changed economic history, by introducing a convenient and universal medium of exchange, whose value is regulated and guaranteed by a political authority. In order to be used as a means of payment, coins need to be recognized as valid and trustworthy. Combining carefully designed material features with inscriptions and images, they form a system of symbols that store and transmit information, primarily of an economic nature. The aim of this thesis was to investigate how coins encode information, and to understand how historical dynamics and human cognition shaped their evolution as an informational system. These questions were explored over three studies. The first study investigated the influence of changing political and economic circumstances in the ancient Mediterranean (7th - 1st ct. BCE) on the informative role of graphic designs as marks of issuing authority and monetary value. The second study discussed the advantages and challenges of digitization, standardization and quantitative approaches to cultural data, with a focus on coin iconography. The third study examined the representation and perception of monetary value in the properties of contemporary coins. This thesis shows how we can examine the structure and evolution of coins within an interdisciplinary framework, using quantitative methods, combined with insights from evolutionary and cognitive anthropology, and information theory. The increasing availability of expertly curated digital collections opens more possibilities for developing quantitative approaches necessary for proper interpretation of the processes which shaped observed patterns in cultural data. The approach taken in this thesis complements the research in numismatics and economic history on the origins and development of coinage, while also highlighting the possibilities of using historical artefacts to study large-scale patterns in the evolution and transmission of cultural traits.",gnd:4121333-6 gnd:4026535-3 gnd:4026927-9 gnd:4172175-5 gnd:4040629-5
Development of deep learning applications for the automated extraction of chemical information from scientific literature,"This dissertation focuses on developing deep learning applications for extracting chemical information from scientific literature, particularly targeting the automated recognition of molecular structures in images. DECIMER Segmentation, a novel application, employs a Mask Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (MRCNN) model to segment chemical structures in documents, aided by a mask expansion algorithm, marking a significant advancement in processing chemical literature. The Optical Chemical Structure Recognition (OCSR) tool DECIMER Image Transformer uses an encoder-decoder architecture to convert chemical structure depictions into the machine-readable SMILES format. The model has been trained on over 450 million pairs of images and SMILES representations. Its ability to interpret various depiction styles, including hand-drawn structures, sets a new standard in OCSR. To artificially generate large and diverse OCSR training datasets using multiple cheminformatics toolkits, RanDepict was developed. The diversification of training data ensures robust model generalisation across different chemical structure depictions. A unique dataset of hand-drawn molecule images was created to evaluate the model's performance in interpreting these challenging depictions. This dataset further contributes to the understanding of automated structure recognition from diverse styles. The integration of these technologies led to the creation of DECIMER.ai, an open-source web application that combines segmentation and interpretation tools, allowing users to extract and process chemical information from literature efficiently. The work concludes with a discussion on the significance of open data in advancing molecular informatics, highlighting the potential to broader chemical research domains. By adhering to FAIR data standards and open-source principles, the tools developed for this dissertation are designed for adaptability and future development within the community.",gnd:4040936-3 gnd:4167869-2 gnd:4145448-0 gnd:4193754-5 gnd:4290091-8 gnd:1064023886
Electrical discharge machining of non-conductive advanced ceramics,"Zusammenfassung: Characterized by excellent material properties such has high mechanical, thermal and chemical stability advanced ceramics such as ZrO2, SiC, Si3N4 and AlN are increasingly used for various applications. Traditional means of machining sintered ceramics are expensive and the structure formed using them are limited in accuracy and geometry. Electrical discharge machining (EDM) is an electro-thermal machining process used to structure conductive materials. By applying a conductive layer (denoted as assisting electrode (AE)) on top of the non-conductive material, the EDM process can also be used to structure non-conductive ceramics. The EDM process starts with a discharge taking place between the tool electrode and the assisting electrode. During the process, carbon particles that are secreted from the dielectric oil are deposited on the newly exposed non-conductive ceramic surface forming a thin conductive layer. This intrinsic conductive layer (ICL) insures that the electric contact between the workpiece and the generator is maintained. After the machining process, the conductive layer can easily be removed for instance by heating. However, the fundamental conditions required for the formation of the ICL and the underlying material removal mechanism of the µ-EDM of the non-conductive ceramics using AE is not fully understood",gnd:4329808-4 gnd:4841919-9 gnd:4226770-5 gnd:4014255-3
Sources and environmental controls of microbial membrane lipids in soils and groundwater,"Microorganisms have the ability to control the biophysical properties of their membrane lipids to thrive in natural environments. Different microbial species possess different membrane lipid compositions, even the composition of a single species is not always constant, but depends on the habitat conditions. Microorganisms adjust their membrane lipid composition by modifying the types of glycerol backbone (chain length, saturation, and branching) and head groups. Therefore, signatures of membrane lipids in the environmental samples could be used as biomarkers reflecting the physicochemical conditions and the community structures. With the increasing knowledge of lipid structures and their properties, the interpretation of lipid-based biomarker in environmental samples would be more accurate. By using lipidomics, this thesis aimed at (i) identifying new lipid isomers to help improve the precision of its derived proxy, (ii) expanding the application of lipid biomarkers to the terrestrial subsurface critical zone for tracing the signal of surface down, (iii) providing a full lipid profile in the soils, investigating their sources and potential possibility as novel chemotaxonomic markers for bacteria.",gnd:4169808-3 gnd:4203814-5 gnd:4039226-0 gnd:1027486754 gnd:4022369-3 gnd:4007348-8

Polymer Mach-Zehnder interferometers for refractive index sensing,"Abstract: This thesis presents polymeric Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZI) for refractive index sensing. These interferometers are designed as asymmetric Mach-Zehnder interferometers (AMZIs), meaning that, when compared with the conventional MZI, the devices have no interaction window on the sensing arm. The asymmetricity is realized by designing the sensing arm and reference arm with different widths. The analyte of interest, acting as the cladding layer, covers the entire surface. The phase shift is induced by the external refractive index change due to the different sensitivities of the two arms.<br>Polymers with variable refractive index and viscosity allow great flexibility in design and fabrication. The transfer from traditional photo-lithography to the roll-to-roll process of polymer AMZIs enables us to fabricate cost-efficient sensors on a flexible platform. The thermal expansion and thermo-optic co-efficient of the customized polymers and PMMA substrate are characterized experimentally, and the data are used in the temperature simulations of AMZIs.<br>Four design types of AMZIs, using either curved tapers on the Y-couplers or straight tapers on the sensing arm, are presented. Extensive simulation and experimental results show the functionality of the AMZI to external refractive index change with a limit of detection (LOD) in the order 10−3 refractive index units (RIU). Temperature simulation of the AMZIs indicates a signal change of 1% per degree within temperature range 10 to 60 ◦C.<br>In addition, to enhance the sensitivity of the AMZIs, a simple yet efficient method is presented using tailored high-index thin films on the surface of the core layer. Simulation and experimental results show that a properly-placed PTFE/Ta2O5 thin film can lead to enhanced sensitivity of AMZIs to refractive index changes of factors between 3 and 8. The thin films are deposited on the polymer surface using ion beam sputtering at low temperatures (< 80◦C) thereby avoiding detrimental heating effects on the substrate. It is shown that LOD of the AMZIs is enhanced by a factor 10 (down to Δn ≤ 10−4) using these films",gnd:4168432-1 gnd:4146524-6
The fragmentation of massive star-forming regions,"Since its discovery by E. Salpeter in 1955, the high-mass end of the Initial Mass Function (IMF) has been continuously tested, and its slope has not changed from the value -2.35 originally calculated by Salpeter, the ""Salpeter value"". Furthermore, it is found that this value is universal. It not only describes the mass distribution of stellar masses in the Milky Way but also in other galaxies. Stars form individually or in systems within molecular clouds, from local condensations of sizes on the order of ~0.01 pc, the so-called ""dense cores"". In the case of low-mass star-forming regions, it is found that the Core Mass Function (CMF) resembles the Salpeter IMF. However, in the case of massive star-forming (MSF) regions, the answer is not that clear. The first CMF for a MSF region was derived in 2004 by H. Beuther and P. Schilke for the MSF region IRAS19410+2336. They found that this CMF also resembled the Salpeter IMF. Since then, a few more CMFs for MSF regions have been derived, always with exponents comparable to Salpeter. This suggested that the CMF and the IMF are related in a one-to-one or nearly one-to-one relationship, and that the fragmentation processes within a molecular cloud would set the shape of the IMF at an early evolutionary stage ...",gnd:4057365-5 gnd:4169052-7 gnd:4027296-5 gnd:4005560-7
Genetic and molecular analysis of heat stress induced transcriptional memory,"Heat stress (HS) is one of the most common abiotic stresses, frequently affecting plant growth and crop production. With its fluctuating nature, HS episodes are frequently interspersed by stress-free intervals. Plants can be primed by HS, allowing them to survive better a recurrent stress episode. A memory of this priming can be maintained during stress-free intervals and this memory is closely correlated with transcriptional memory at several HS-inducible loci. This transcriptional memory is evident from hyper-induction of a locus upon a recurrent HS. ASCORBATE PEROXIDASE 2 (APX2) shows such hyper-induction upon recurring HS, however, the molecular basis of this transcriptional memory is not understood. Previous research showed that the HSinduced transcriptional memory at APX2 can last for up to seven days, and that it is controlled by cis-regulatory elements within the APX2 promoter. To identify regulators involved in HS transcriptional memory, an unbiased forward genetic screening using EMS mutated seeds of pAPX2::LUC was performed from this screen. [...]",gnd:4391224-2
Structural insights into sodium-rich silicate-carbonate glasses and melts : a combined study of trace element in-situ XAFS and molecular dynamics,"Carbonate-rich silicate and carbonate melts play a crucial role in deep Earth magmatic processes and their melt structure is a key parameter, as it controls physical and chemical properties. Carbonate-rich melts can be strongly  enriched in geochemically important trace elements. The structural incorporation mechanisms of these elements are difficult to study because such melts generally cannot be quenched to glasses, which are usually employed for structural investigations. This thesis investigates the influence of CO2 on the local environments of trace elements contained in silicate glasses with variable CO2 concentrations as well as in silicate and carbonate melts. The compositions studied include sodium-rich peralkaline silicate melts and glasses and carbonate melts similar to those occurring naturally at Oldoinyo Lengai volcano, Tanzania. The local environments of the three elements yttrium (Y), lanthanum (La) and strontium (Sr) were investigated in synthesized glasses and melts using X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy. Especially extended X-ray  absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS) provides element specific  information on local structure, such as bond lengths, coordination numbers and the degree of disorder. To cope with the enhanced structural disorder present in glasses and melts, EXAFS analysis was based on fitting approaches using an asymmetric distribution function as well as a correlation model according to bond valence theory. Firstly, silicate glasses quenched from high pressure/temperature melts with up to 7.6 wt % CO2 were investigated. In strongly and extremely peralkaline glasses the local structure of Y is unaffected by the CO2 content (with oxygen bond lengths of ~ 2.29 Å). ...",gnd:4021142-3 gnd:4181365-0 gnd:4147300-0 gnd:4015942-5 gnd:4171239-0 gnd:4170370-4

Single-column data profiling,"The research area of data profiling consists of a large set of methods and processes to examine a given dataset and determine metadata about it.

Integrated structural analysis using isogeometric finite element methods,"The gradual digitization in the architecture, engineering, and construction industry over the past fifty years led to an extremely heterogeneous software environment, which today is embodied by the multitude of different digital tools and proprietary data formats used by the many specialists contributing to the design process in a construction project. Though these projects become increasingly complex, the demands on financial efficiency and the completion within a tight schedule grow at the same time. The digital collaboration of project partners has been identified as one key issue in successfully dealing with these challenges. Yet currently, the numerous software applications and their respective individual views on the design process severely impede that collaboration. An approach to establish a unified basis for the digital collaboration, regardless of the existing software heterogeneity, is a comprehensive digital building model contributed to by all projects partners. This type of data management known as building information modeling (BIM) has many benefits, yet its adoption is associated with many difficulties and thus, proceeds only slowly. One aspect in the field of conflicting requirements on such a digital model is the cooperation of architects and structural engineers. Traditionally, these two disciplines use different abstractions of reality for their models that in consequence lead to incompatible digital representations thereof. The onset of isogeometric analysis (IGA) promised to ease the discrepancy in design and analysis model representations. Yet, that initial focus quickly shifted towards using these methods as a more powerful basis for numerical simulations. Furthermore, the isogeometric representation alone is not capable of solving the model abstraction problem. It is thus the intention of this work to contribute to an improved digital collaboration of architects and engineers by exploring an integrated analysis approach on the basis of an unified digital model and solid geometry expressed by splines. In the course of this work, an analysis framework is developed that utilizes such models to automatically conduct numerical simulations commonly required in construction projects. In essence, this allows to retrieve structural analysis results from BIM models in a fast and simple manner, thereby facilitating rapid design iterations and profound design feedback. The BIM implementation Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) is reviewed with regard to its capabilities of representing the unified model. The current IFC schema strongly supports the use of redundant model data, a major pitfall in digital collaboration. Additionally, it does not allow to describe the geometry by volumetric splines. As the pursued approach builds upon a unique model for both, architectural and structural design, and furthermore requires solid geometry, necessary schema modifications are suggested. Structural entities are modeled by volumetric NURBS patches, each of which constitutes an individual subdomain that, with regard to the analysis, is incompatible with the remaining full model. The resulting consequences for numerical simulation are elaborated in this work. The individual subdomains have to be weakly coupled, for which the mortar method is used. Different approaches to discretize the interface traction fields are implemented and their respective impact on the analysis results is evaluated. All necessary coupling conditions are automatically derived from the related geometry model. The weak coupling procedure leads to a linear system of equations in saddle point form, which, owed to the volumetric modeling, is large in size and, the associated coefficient matrix has, due to the use of higher degree basis functions, a high bandwidth. The peculiarities of the system require adapted solution methods that generally cause higher numerical costs than the standard procedures for symmetric, positive-definite systems do. Different methods to solve the specific system are investigated and an efficient parallel algorithm is finally proposed. When the structural analysis model is derived from the unified model in the BIM data, it does in general initially not meet the requirements on the discretization that are necessary to obtain sufficiently accurate analysis results. The consequently necessary patch refinements must be controlled automatically to allowfor an entirely automatic analysis procedure. For that purpose, an empirical refinement scheme based on the geometrical and possibly mechanical properties of the specific entities is proposed. The level of refinement may be selectively manipulated by the structural engineer in charge. Furthermore, a Zienkiewicz-Zhu type error estimator is adapted for the use with isogeometric analysis results. It is shown that also this estimator can be used to steer an adaptive refinement procedure.",gnd:4060592-9 gnd:4376916-0 gnd:7718401-4 gnd:7861550-1
Optimal Trajectory Tracking of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems,"['Introduction -- Exactly Realizable Trajectories -- Optimal Control -- Analytical Approximations for Optimal Trajectory Tracking -- Control of Reaction-Diﬀusion System.', 'By establishing an alternative foundation of control theory, this thesis represents a significant advance in the theory of control systems, of interest to a broad range of scientists and engineers. While common control strategies for dynamical systems center on the system state as the object to be controlled, the approach developed here focuses on the state trajectory. The concept of precisely realizable trajectories identifies those trajectories that can be accurately achieved by applying appropriate control signals. The resulting simple expressions for the control signal lend themselves to immediate application in science and technology. The approach permits the generalization of many well-known results from the control theory of linear systems, e.g. the Kalman rank condition to nonlinear systems. The relationship between controllability, optimal control and trajectory tracking are clarified. Furthermore, the existence of linear structures underlying nonlinear optimal control is revealed, enabling the derivation of exact analytical solutions to an entire class of nonlinear optimal trajectory tracking problems. The clear and self-contained presentation focuses on a general and mathematically rigorous analysis of controlled dynamical systems. The concepts developed are visualized with the help of particular dynamical systems motivated by physics and chemistry.']",gnd:4121428-6 gnd:4199872-8 gnd:4208631-0 gnd:4126142-2
Long-term investigation of the lunar tide in the equatorial electrojet during stratospheric sudden warmings,"The ionosphere, which is strongly influenced by the Sun, is known to be also affected by meteorological processes. These processes, despite having their origin in the troposphere and stratosphere, interact with the upper atmosphere. Such an interaction between atmospheric layers is known as vertical coupling. During geomagnetically quiet times, when near-Earth space is not under the influence of solar storms, these processes become important drivers for ionospheric variability. Studying the link between these processes in the lower atmosphere and the ionospheric variability is important for our understanding of fundamental mechanisms in ionospheric and meteorological research. A prominent example of vertical coupling between the stratosphere and the ionosphere are the so-called stratospheric sudden warming (SSW) events that occur usually during northern winters and result in an increase in the polar stratospheric temperature and a reversal of the circumpolar winds. While the phenomenon of SSW is confined to the northern polar…",gnd:4132622-2 gnd:4202863-2 gnd:4130409-3 gnd:4059427-0 gnd:4015173-6 gnd:4066257-3

Behaviour of Rice Husk Ash in Self-Compacting High Performance Concrete,"The main objective of this thesis is to investigate the characteristics of rice husk ash RHA) and then its behaviour in self-compacting high performance concrete (SCHPC) with respects to rheological properties, hydration and microstructure development and alkali silica reaction, in comparison with silica fume (SF). The main results show that the RHA is a macro-mesoporous amorphous siliceous material with a very high silica content comparable with SF. The pore size distribution is the most important parameter of RHA besides amorphous silica content. This parameter affects pore volume, specific surface area, and thus the water demand and the pozzolanic reactivity of RHA and its behaviour in SCHPC. The incorporation of RHA decreases filling and passing abilities, but significantly increases plastic viscosity and segregation resistance of SCHPC. Therefore, RHA can be used as a viscosity modifying admixture for SCHPC. The incorporation of RHA increases the superplasticizer adsorption, the superplasticizer saturation dosage, yield stress and plastic viscosity of mortar. Fresh mortar formulated from SCHPC is a shear-thickening material. The incorporation of RHA/SF ecreases the shearthickening degree. The incorporation of RHA/SF increases the degree of cement hydration. SF appears more effective at 3 days possibly due to the better nucleation site effect, whereas RHA dominates at the later ages possibly due to the internal water curing effect. The incorporation of RHA/SF increases the degree of C3S hydration, particularly the C3S hydration rate from 3 to 14 days. The pozzolanic reaction takes place outside and inside RHA particles. The internal pozzolanic eaction products consolidate the pores inside RHA particles rather than contribute to the pore refinement in the cement matrix. In the presence of the high alkali concentration, RHA particles act as microreactive aggregates and react with alkali hydroxide to generate the expansive alkali silica reaction products. Increasing the particle size and temperature increases the alkali silica reactivity of RHA. The mechanism for the successive pozzolanic and alkali silica reactions of RHA is theorized. Additionally, a new simple mix design method is proposed for SCHPC containing various supplementary cementitious materials, i.e. RHA, SF, fly ash and limestone powder.",gnd:4251715-1 gnd:4260103-4 gnd:7684670-2 gnd:4143201-0 gnd:4621624-8
Multi-messenger astronomy with H.E.S.S : the starburst galaxy NGC 253 and the search for short time-scale transients,"Gamma-ray astronomy has proven to provide unique insights into cosmic-ray accelerators in the past few decades. By combining information at the highest photon energies with the entire electromagnetic spectrum in multi-wavelength studies, detailed knowledge of non-thermal particle populations in astronomical objects and systems has been gained: Many individual classes of gamma-ray sources could be identified inside our galaxy and outside of it. Different sources were found to exhibit a wide range of temporal evolution, ranging from seconds to stable behaviours over many years of observations. With the dawn of both neutrino- and gravitational wave astronomy, additional messengers have come into play over the last years.

Characterisation of the natural homeotic variety Stamenoid petals (Spe) in the Sherpherd's Purse (Capsella bursa-pastoris) : establishment of a new model system,"In the evolution of floral structures a number of examples exist where homeotic changes in flower organisation probably occurred at the base of taxonomic groups. It is, however, not known how exactly natural morphological diversity is generated, especially how homeotic changes which originated spontaneously in the wild get fixed in a population. A plant model system in which the role of a spontaneous homeotic mutation can be studied in a multidisciplinary approach combining morphological, genetic, molecular and ecological methods was not available so far. In this thesis I established the natural floral homeotic Spe (Stamenoid petals) variety of Capsella bursa-pastoris, in which petals are completely transformed into stamens, as such a model system. In a concomitant review article known facts about the role of homeosis were compiled to demonstrate the potential of C. bursa-pastoris as a model species and for introduction of the Spe variant. A hypothesis on the underlying molecular mechanism based on ectopic expression of a class C organ identity gene as well as an experimental program to study this phenomenon with ecological and evolutionary methods was developed in the review article. With my experimental results I demonstrated that the Spe variety shows a complete homeotic shift from petals to stamens that is driven by an allele of a single co-dominant locus in two different Spe variety lines without pleiotropic effects. The co-dominant mode of inheritance of the Spe phenotype suggested a gain-of-function mutation in a regulatory region of the same gene in two independent Spe variety lines. I also showed that ectopic expression of two AG-like genes, CbpAG and CbpSTK, correlate with organ transformation, of which very likely the CbpAG ectopic expression is directly responsible for the changed organ identity. Results of parallel PhD work of J. Ziermann demonstrated that exclusively the class C gene CbpAGa co-segregates with the mutant phenotype and that likely a change in a candidate cis-regulatory region of the CbpAGa gene is responsible for the deviating expression patterns of this gene. These results have been included into the publication of my analyses.",gnd:4159968-8 gnd:4340715-8
Polyelectrolyte multilayers for plasmonics and picosecond ultrasonics,"This thesis investigates the application of polyelectrolyte multilayers in plasmonics and picosecond acoustics.

Nonclassical plasmonics has been spurred on in recent years by the tremendous technological progress in nanofabrication and optical characterization; today, it is possible to investigate the plasmonic features of nanostructures with characteristic features in the few nanometer range.

Fredholm Theory with Applications to Random Operators,"['This thesis is concerned with the Fredholm theory of bounded linear operators acting on Banach space valued sequence spaces. As an application, random operators are considered and studied in detail. One of the most important tools in the study of operators on sequence spaces is the concept of limit operators. The correspondence between an operator and its limit operators is studied regarding properties like spectrum, pseudospectrum and numerical range. It turns out that similar theorems can be formulated for all these properties, respectively. These results prove to be particularly useful in the case of random operators. Special attention is directed to the so-called Feinberg-Zee random hopping matrix, which, despite its simple appearance, seems to have a very complicated spectrum. With the help of new methods, improved upper and lower bounds to the spectrum are obtained. One of these lower bounds is an infinite sequence of Julia sets, which emphasizes the complexity of the spectrum of this particular operator.$cen$dAbstract', 'Diese Arbeit befasst sich mit der Fredholmtheorie von beschränkten linearen Operatoren auf banachraumwertigen Folgenräumen.

Generalized Beam Theory for the analysis of thin-walled circular pipe members,"The detailed structural analysis of thin-walled circular pipe members often requires the use of a shell or solid-based finite element method. Although these methods provide a very good approximation of the deformations, they require a higher degree of discretization which causes high computational costs. On the other hand, the analysis of thin-walled circular pipe members based on classical beam theories is easy to implement and needs much less computation time, however, they are limited in their ability to approximate the deformations as they cannot consider the deformation of the cross-section. This dissertation focuses on the study of the Generalized Beam Theory (GBT) which is both accurate and efficient in analyzing thin-walled members. This theory is based on the separation of variables in which the displacement field is expressed as a combination of predetermined deformation modes related to the cross-section, and unknown amplitude functions defined on the beam's longitudinal axis. Although the GBT was initially developed for long straight members, through the consideration of complementary deformation modes, which amend the null transverse and shear membrane strain assumptions of the classical GBT, problems involving short members, pipe bends, and geometrical nonlinearity can also be analyzed using GBT. In this dissertation, the GBT formulation for the analysis of these problems is developed and the application and capabilities of the method are illustrated using several numerical examples. Furthermore, the displacement and stress field results of these examples are verified using an equivalent refined shell-based finite element model. The developed static and dynamic GBT formulations for curved thin-walled circular pipes are based on the linear kinematic description of the curved shell theory. In these formulations, the complex problem in pipe bends due to the strong coupling effect of the longitudinal bending, warping and the cross-sectional ovalization is handled precisely through the derivation of the coupling tensors between the considered GBT deformation modes. Similarly, the geometrically nonlinear GBT analysis is formulated for thin-walled circular pipes based on the nonlinear membrane kinematic equations. Here, the initial linear and quadratic stress and displacement tangent stiffness matrices are built using the third and fourth-order GBT deformation mode coupling tensors. Longitudinally, the formulation of the coupled GBT element stiffness and mass matrices are presented using a beam-based finite element formulation. Furthermore, the formulated GBT elements are tested for shear and membrane locking problems and the limitations of the formulations regarding the membrane locking problem are discussed.",gnd:4017233-8
Correlation between dynamic parameters and device performance of organic solar cells,"Organic bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells based on polymer:fullerene blends are a promising alternative for a low-cost solar energy conversion. Despite significant improvements of the power conversion efficiency in recent years, the fundamental working principles of these devices are yet not fully understood. In general, the current output of organic solar cells is determined by the generation of free charge carriers upon light absorption and their transport to the electrodes in competition to the loss of charge carriers due to recombination. The object of this thesis is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the dynamic processes and physical parameters determining the performance. A new approach for analyzing the characteristic current-voltage output was developed comprising the experimental determination of the efficiencies of charge carrier generation, recombination and transport, combined with numerical device simulations.

Investigations on the vaccination against the Bluetongue Virus serotypes 4 and 8 in sheep,"The aim of this cumulative thesis was to investigate on the one hand whether vaccinations with inactivated Bluetongue Virus (BTV)-8 vaccines induce antibodies in sheep still detectable after five to seven and a half years. On the other hand, different vaccination schemes and techniques in sheep using inactivated BTV-4 and BTV-8 vaccines were compared under field conditions. In the first study, the presence of BTV antibodies was proven five to seven and a half year after previous vaccinations with inactived BTV-8 vaccines. Boosted vaccinations improved seropositivity, but even after only one vaccination antibodies were found after seven and a half years. In the second study, eight different vaccination schemes, using four commercially available inactivated Bluetongue vaccines against serotypes 4 and 8 were tested in three different combinations (setting 1-3) under field conditions for their ability to generate a measurable immune response in 240 sheep. All vaccine combinations were well tolerated by all sheep. In setting 1, there were no relevant significant differences in the immunogenic response between simultaneously applied vaccines at different sites or at the same injection site with a twin-syringe. Importantly, a one-shot vaccination induced comparable immunogenicity to a boosted injection. Low serotype-specific neutralising antibody levels were detected in settings 2 and 3 and are attributed to diverse factors, which may have influenced the measured immunogenicity, due to the setting as a field trial. The results of the described studies propose that vaccination recommendations could be simplified substantially to motivate more farmers to vaccinate their ruminant livestock.",gnd:4026656-4 gnd:4051990-9 gnd:4113937-9 gnd:4012494-0 gnd:4238919-7
Wohin mit der sozialistischen Persönlichkeit? : transformatives Lehren und Lernen von Geographielehrkräften in Ostdeutschland,"['In East German schools geography was one of those subjects with an extensive share of political content connected with the communist ideology of Marxism and Leninism. Additionally, pupils’ educational skills oriented toward the same ideological and humanistic parameters were also highly valued. The main focus was creating socialist citizens with socialist personalities. This paper tries to sift out what was demanded from the teachers in former East Germany to make this a reality in schools. Due to the fall of the Berlin wall a reorganization of the East German educational system was necessary. In this case the paper tries to find answers to the questions of how geography teachers managed to handle this shake-up and, ultimately, if or how they were convinced about it. Therefore, interviews were implemented with teachers who taught geography at school both in East Germany and in the reunited Germany. The main questions related to the preferred way of teaching before and after the political system transformation. The results show a low level of differences between geography lessons in East and West German schools. So maybe there was no need or will to change contents and styles of the lessons. It seems that already during the last decade of the GDR most of the interviewed teachers reduced the amount of ideological and political content just to extend the physical geography. So, for them it was possible to continue working after the fall of the Berlin wall without big difficulties. Also, there seemed to be many similarities between the value educations in East and West Germany. Only the main difference – the socialist ideology – was cancelled. Today the subject geography belongs to the department of social sciences at school, but during the interviews a lot of the teachers made clear that in their point of view geography is a part of the natural sciences section. That is surprising because even in East Germany most of the content was related to the social part as well. The responsibility to educate children in the communist way had of course vanished and nearly all of the interviewed teachers are happy with that. But still today they continue to emphasize the East German value education with its humanistic foundation.', 'Das Schulfach Geographie war in der DDR eines der Fächer, das sehr stark mit politischen Themen im Sinne des Marxismus-Leninismus bestückt war. Ein anderer Aspekt sind die sozialistischen Erziehungsziele, die in der Schulbildung der DDR hoch im Kurs standen. Im Fokus stand diesbezüglich die Erziehung der Kinder zu sozialistischen Persönlichkeiten. Die Arbeit versucht einen klaren Blick auf diesen Umstand zu werfen, um zu erfahren, was da von den Lehrkräften gefordert wurde und wie es in der Schule umzusetzen war. Durch den Fall der Mauer war natürlich auch eine Umstrukturierung des Bildungssystems im Osten unausweichlich. Hier will die Arbeit Einblicke geben, wie die Geographielehrkräfte diese Transformation mitgetragen und umgesetzt haben. Welche Wesenszüge aus der Sozialisierung in der DDR haben sich bei der Gestaltung des Unterrichtes und dessen Ausrichtung auf die neuen Erziehungsziele erhalten?  Hierzu wurden Geographielehrkräfte befragt, die sowohl in der DDR als auch im geeinten Deutschland unterrichtet haben. Die Fragen bezogen sich in erster Linie auf die Art und Weise des Unterrichtens vor, während und nach der Wende und der daraus entstandenen Systemtransformation. Die Befragungen kommen zu dem Ergebnis, dass sich der Geographieunterricht in der DDR thematisch von dem in der BRD nicht sonderlich unterschied. Von daher bedurfte es keiner umfangreichen inhaltlichen Veränderung des Geographieunterrichts. Schon zu DDR-Zeiten wurden durch die Lehrkräfte offenbar eigenmächtig ideologiefreie physisch-geographische Themen oft ausgedehnt, um die Ideologie des Faches zu reduzieren. So fiel den meisten eine Anpassung ihres Unterrichts an das westdeutsche System relativ leicht. Die humanistisch geprägte Werteerziehung des DDR-Bildungssystems wurde unter Ausklammerung des sozialistischen Aspektes ebenso fortgeführt, da es auch hier viele Parallelen zum westdeutschen System gegeben hat. Deutlich wird eine Charakterisierung des Faches als Naturwissenschaft von Seiten der ostdeutschen Lehrkräfte, obwohl das Fach an den Schulen den Gesellschaftswissenschaften zugeordnet wird und auch in der DDR eine starke wirtschaftsgeographische Ausrichtung hatte. Von der Verantwortung sozialistische Persönlichkeiten zu erziehen, wurden die Lehrkräfte mit dem Ende der DDR entbunden und die in dieser Arbeit aufgeführten Interviewauszüge lassen keinen Zweifel daran, dass es dem Großteil der Befragten darum nicht leidtat, sie sich aber bis heute an der Werteorientierung aus DDR-Zeiten orientieren.']",gnd:4020216-1 gnd:4156681-6 gnd:4235034-7 gnd:4062009-8
Speech enhancement exploiting the source-filter model,"Imagining everyday life without mobile telephony is nowadays hardly possible. Calls are being made in every thinkable situation and environment. Hence, the microphone will not only pick up the user’s speech but also sound from the surroundings which is likely to impede the understanding of the conversational partner. Modern speech enhancement systems are able to mitigate such effects and most users are not even aware of their existence. In this thesis the development of a modern single-channel speech enhancement approach is presented, which uses the divide and conquer principle to combat environmental noise in microphone signals. Though initially motivated by mobile telephony applications, this approach can be applied whenever speech is to be retrieved from a corrupted signal. The approach uses the so-called source-filter model to divide the problem into two subproblems which are then subsequently conquered by enhancing the source (the excitation signal) and the filter (the spectral envelope) separately. Both enhanced signals are then used to denoise the corrupted signal. The estimation of spectral envelopes has quite some history and some approaches already exist for speech enhancement. However, they typically neglect the excitation signal which leads to the inability of enhancing the fine structure properly. Both individual enhancement approaches exploit benefits of the cepstral domain which offers, e.g., advantageous mathematical properties and straightforward synthesis of excitation-like signals. We investigate traditional model-based schemes like Gaussian mixture models (GMMs), classical signal processing-based, as well as modern deep neural network (DNN)-based approaches in this thesis. The enhanced signals are not used directly to enhance the corrupted signal (e.g., to synthesize a clean speech signal) but as so-called a priori signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) estimate in a traditional statistical speech enhancement system. Such a traditional system consists of a noise power estimator, an a priori SNR estimator, and a spectral weighting rule that is usually driven by the results of the aforementioned estimators and subsequently employed to retrieve the clean speech estimate from the noisy observation. As a result the new approach obtains significantly higher noise attenuation compared to current state-of-the-art systems while maintaining a quite comparable speech component quality and speech intelligibility. In consequence, the overall quality of the enhanced speech signal turns out to be superior as compared to state-of-the-art speech ehnahcement approaches.",gnd:4177102-3 gnd:4116579-2

Inverse and forward modeling tools for biophotonic data,"Biophotonic data require specific treatments due to the difficulty of directly extracting information from them. Therefore, artificial intelligence tools including machine learning and deep learning brought into play. These tools can be grouped into inverse modeling, preprocessing and data modeling categories. In each of these three categories, one research question was investigated. First, the aim was to develop a method that can acquire the Raman-like spectra from coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) spectra without apriori knowledge. In general, CARS spectra suffer from the non-resonant background (NRB) contribution, and existing methods were commonly implemented to remove it. However, these methods were not able to completely remove the NRB and need additional preprocessing afterward. Therefore, deep learning via the long-short-term memory network was applied and outperformed these existing methods. Then, a denoising technique via deep learning was developed for reconstructing high-quality (HQ) multimodal images (MM) from low-quality (LQ) ones. Since the measurement of HQ MM images is time-consuming, which is impractical for clinical applications, we developed a network, namely incSRCNN, to directly predict HQ images using only LQ ones. This network shows better performance when compared with standard methods. Finally, we intended to improve the accuracy of the classification model in particular when LQ Raman data or Raman data with varying quality are obtained. Therefore, a novel method based on functional data analysis was implemented, which converts the Raman data into functions and then applies functional dimension reduction followed by a classification method. The results showed better performance for the functional approach in comparison with the classical method.",gnd:7616461-5 gnd:1135597375 gnd:4176916-8
Attacking complexity in logic synthesis of asynchronous circuits,"Most of the microelectronic circuits fabricated today are synchronous, i.e. they are driven by one or several clock signals. Synchronous circuit design faces several fundamental challenges such as high-speed clock distribution, integration of multiple cores operating at different clock rates, reduction of power consumption and dealing with voltage, temperature, manufacturing and runtime variations. Asynchronous or clockless design plays a key role in alleviating these challenges, however the design and test of asynchronous circuits is much more difficult in comparison to their synchronous counterparts. A driving force for a widespread use of asynchronous technology is the availability of mature EDA (Electronic Design Automation) tools which provide an entire automated design flow starting from an HDL (Hardware Description Language) specification yielding the final circuit layout. Even though there was much progress in developing such EDA tools for asynchronous circuit design during the last two decades, the maturity level as well as the acceptance of them is still not comparable with tools for synchronous circuit design. In particular, logic synthesis (which implies the application of Boolean minimisation techniques) for the entire system's control path can significantly improve the efficiency of the resulting asynchronous implementation, e.g. in terms of chip area and performance. However, logic synthesis, in particular for asynchronous circuits, suffers from complexity problems. Signal Transitions Graphs (STGs) are labelled Petri nets which are a widely used to specify the interface behaviour of speed independent (SI) circuits - a robust subclass of asynchronous circuits. STG decomposition is a promising approach to tackle complexity problems like state space explosion in logic synthesis of SI circuits. The (structural) decomposition of STGs is guided by a partition of the output signals and generates a usually much smaller component STG for each partition member, i.e. a component STG with a much smaller state space than the initial specification. However, decomposition can result in component STGs that in isolation have so-called irreducible CSC conflicts (i.e. these components are not SI synthesisable anymore) even if the specification has none of them. A new approach is presented to avoid such conflicts by introducing internal communication between the components. So far, STG decompositions are guided by the finest output partitions, i.e. one output per component. However, this might not yield optimal circuit implementations. Efficient heuristics are presented to determine coarser partitions leading to improved circuits in terms of chip area. For the new algorithms correctness proofs are given and their implementations are incorporated into the decomposition tool DESIJ. The presented techniques are successfully applied to some benchmarks - including 'real-life' specifications arising in the context of control resynthesis - which delivered promising results.",gnd:4271581-7 gnd:4312536-0 gnd:4159102-1

Read-Out and Coherent Manipulation of an Isolated Nuclear Spin : Using a Single-Molecule Magnet Spin-Transistor,"['This thesis sheds new light on the worldwide first electrical manipulation of a single nuclear spin. Over the last four decades, the size of a bit, the smallest logical unit in a computer, has decreased by more than two orders of magnitude and will soon reach a limit where quantum phenomena become important. Inspired by the power of quantum mechanics, researchers have already identified pure quantum systems, having, analog to a classical bit, two controllable and readable states. In this regard, the inherent spin of electrons or nuclei with its two eigenstates, spin up and spin down, is a promising candidate. Using expertise in the field of single-molecule magnets, the author developed a molecular transistor, which allows quantum information to be written onto a single nuclear spin by means of an electric field only, and, in addition, enables the electronic read-out of this quantum state. This novel approach opens a path to addressing and manipulating individual nuclear spins within a very confined space (a single molecule), at high speed. Thus, the author was able to show that single molecule magnets are promising candidates for quantum information processing, which is triggering a new field of research towards molecular quantum electronics.', 'Introduction -- Single Electron Transistor -- Magnetic Properties of TbPc2 -- Experimental Details -- Single-Molecule Magnet Spin-Transistor -- Nuclear Spin Dynamics - T1 -- Nuclear Spin Dynamics – T*2 -- Conclusion and Outlook.']",gnd:7755384-6 gnd:4163636-3 gnd:4176600-3 gnd:4842734-2
Transnational microfinance and mission drift : evidence from Sub Saharan Africa,"['The increasing integration between microfinance flows in Sub Saharan Africa (SSA) and the global financial economy could provide the necessary capital to meet the financial needs of poor clients.

The research therefore examines the impact of the different sources of investment on microfinance performance and mission drift in SSA, which is the world’s poorest region. The study utilizes three proxies of transnationalization, namely the percentage of foreign banks to total banks, FDI to GDP and cross-border commitments.

Novel microfluidic systems for raman spectroscopy based antibiotic susceptibility tests,"In the present work powerful microfluidic-based approaches for clinical-spectroscopic diagnostics of bacteria were developed. With special attention paid to urinary tract infections microfluidic systems were designed and realized that enable Raman spectroscopic identification of bacteria and their antibiotic resistance directly from patients’ material. The background was to provide innovative faster and yet sensitive and specific alternatives to the standard microbiological practice. A combined dielectrophoresis Raman setup was established. It took only 35 minutes to successfully distinguish the two typical pathogens of urinary tract infections from patients’ urine samples, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis. A centrifugal microfluidic platform was manufactured. Within 1.5 hours the important characteristics of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis recovered from the urinary tract of patients were acquired. The issue of polymicrobial infections was addressed. A non-linear hybrid statistical approach based on Partial Least Squares regression in combination with Maximum-Likelihood Parameter estimation methods led to accurate predictions of various mixing ratios of bacteria. The applicability of the dielectrophoresis-Raman setup as a measurement platform for antibiotic susceptibility tests was verified. With the development of an advanced statistical model based on Partial Least Squares Regression and Linear Discriminant Analysis, vancomycin resistant enterococci could be highly sensitively and specifically diagnosed within 1.5 hours. The technology was integrated into a closed microfluidic system. The functionality of the microfluidic system was successfully demonstrated by the determination of fluoroquinolone-resistances in Escherichia coli.

In order to characterize nonclassical states, a new experimental technique, the homodyne cross correlation measurement, was realized, showing a so far unknown insight into the quantumness of a squeezed state. Also, an experimentally accessible witnessing approach for the degree of nonclassicality is presented for arbitrary quantum states.<eng>",gnd:4047990-0 gnd:4176600-3 gnd:4172677-7 gnd:4209367-3
"Preparation of novel photoactive materials : different pre-compositions, post-modifications and improved performance","Photocatalysis is considered significant in this new energy era, because the inexhaustibly abundant, clean, and safe energy of the sun can be harnessed for sustainable, nonhazardous, and economically development of our society. In the research of photocatalysis, the current focus was held by the design and modification of photocatalyst. As one of the most promising photocatalysts, g-C3N4 has gained considerable attention for its eye-catching properties. It has been extensively explored in photocatalysis applications, such as water splitting, organic pollutant degradation, and CO2 reduction. Even so, it also has its own drawbacks which inhibit its further application. Inspired by that, this thesis will mainly present and discuss the process and achievement on the preparation of some novel photocatalysts and their photocatalysis performance. These materials were all synthesized via the alteration of classic g-C3N4 preparation method, like using different pre-compositions for initial supramolecular complex and functional group…",gnd:4420216-7 gnd:4022993-2 gnd:4174545-0
Ab Initio Studies on Superconductivity in Alkali-Doped Fullerides,"['This book covers high-transition temperature (Tc) s-wave superconductivity and the neighboring Mott insulating phase in alkali-doped fullerides. The author presents (1) a unified theoretical description of the phase diagram and (2) a nonempirical calculation of Tc. For these purposes, the author employs an extension of the DFT+DMFT (density-functional theory + dynamical mean-field theory). He constructs a realistic electron–phonon-coupled Hamiltonian with a newly formulated downfolding method. The Hamiltonian is analyzed by means of the extended DMFT. A notable aspect of the approach is that it requires only the crystal structure as a priori knowledge. Remarkably, the nonempirical calculation achieves for the first time a quantitative reproduction of the experimental phase diagram including the superconductivity and the Mott phase. The calculated Tc agrees well with the experimental data, with the difference within 10 K. The book provides details of the computational scheme, which can also be applied to other superconductors and other phonon-related topics. The author clearly describes a superconducting mechanism where the Coulomb and electron\xad–phonon interactions show an unusual cooperation in the superconductivity thanks to the Jahn–Teller nature of the phonons.', 'Introduction to superconductivity in alkali-doped fullerides -- Methods: Ab initio downfolding and model-calculation techniques -- Application of cDFPT to alkali-doped fullerides -- Analysis of low-energy Hamiltonians with extended DMFT -- Concluding remarks.']",gnd:4141062-2 gnd:4148259-1 gnd:4130672-7 gnd:4058651-0 gnd:4224517-5 gnd:4364003-5
The classification of isotrivially fibred surfaces with p g,"In our thesis we treat mainly two topics: the classification of isotrivially fibred surfaces with p_g=q=2, and the construction of new Beauville surfaces. An isotrivially fibred surface is a smooth projective surface endowed with a morphism onto a smooth curve such that all the smooth fibres are isomorphic to each other. The first goal of this thesis is to classify the isotrivially fibred surfaces with p_g=q=2 completing and extending a result by Zucconi. As an important byproduct, we provide new examples of minimal surfaces of general type with p_g=q=2 and K^2=4,5 and the first example with K^2=6. We say that a surface S is isogenous to a product of curves if S = (C times F )/G, for C and F smooth curves and G a finite group acting freely on C times F. Beauville surfaces are a special case of surfaces isogenous to a product. In this thesis we include part of a joint work with Shelly Garion, in which we construct new Beauville surfaces with group G either PSL(2,p^e), or A_n, or S_n, proving a conjecture of Bauer, Catanese and Grunewald. The proofs rely on probabilistic group theoretical results of Liebeck and Shalev, and on classical results of Macbeath ...",gnd:4195660-6

Two-photon water splitting and related work for a green hydrogen economy,"['Herein, discovery of the first mechanism for water splitting that only requires two photons is described. Through detailed kinetic, spectroscopic and computational investigations of a molecular ruthenium complex, it was found that absorption of the first, shorter wavelength photon generates an intermediate capable of absorbing the second, longer wavelength photon.

Territorial governance through nature conservation regimes : an analysis of spatial planning traditions and the role of UNESCO Biosphere Reserves,"['Zusammenfassung: Defined as models for sustainable development, Biosphere Reserves (BR) have been generally accepted as a promising option for backwashing spatially planned interactions for nature conservation and urbanization. As UNESCO designated sites for development, the assumption over their diffusing power into other planning scales and spatial units emerged as a framework in which both planning approaches and their interdependencies were explored. The assumption over the diffusing power of BRs implied that the traditional divide between nature conservation and urban planning would result into a theory of convergence and point towards a series of trade-offs that would temporality consolidate into one planning. It was precisely this convergence and system of trade-offs what interested this research and thus, the objective of this research grounded on “understanding” how and which were the trade-offs between both planning traditions. With the use of two case studies, and a mix of grounded theory and deductive approaches, a self-standing theory on borders’ definition and innovation of territories emerged as a final result.  The case study design included Mexico and Guatemala and focused particularly on reviewing the genesis of their administrative and governmental units, their planning traditions and their embedded BR designations (Calakmul BR in Mexico and Maya BR in Guatemala).  The results pointed at the concept of identity as the core element for the definition of borders. As a social organization principle, identity showed to be an important conglomerating element for collective processes and organizations. Once the spatial borders of identity were stabilized, the resulting territorial regimes entered into power relations with other organizations and their spatial units. In doing so, organizations saw the need to develop and to specialize their sovereignty conservation strategies. Five different sovereignty conservation strategies emerged. The first strategy is the provision of public services, the second is the certification of ownership, the third and fourth is linked to education and awareness building and finally, the fifth strategy relates to the use of spatial planning for the designation and definition of sub-borders. Results showed that the relationships between BRs and spatial planning laid mainly on how the BR offered the different actors a possibility to innovate their identity and thus their sovereignty strategies through nature c ...', 'Zusammenfassung: Biosphärenreservate (BR) werden als Modelle für nachhaltige Entwicklung definiert und gelten als eine vielversprechende Option für die Integration der raumplanerischen Interaktionen zwischen Naturschutz und Urbanisierungs-Prozessen. UNESCO-BR Stätten, welche für eine nachhaltige Entwicklung vorgesehen sind, schufen den Forschungsrahmen für die vorliegende Arbeit, in der Ausstrahlungseffekte der BR auf andere Planungsebenen und räumliche Einheiten untersucht wurden. Umgekehrt wurde auch analysiert wie traditionelle Planungsansätze Auswirkungen auf die Gestaltung der BR haben. Die Annahme, dass die BR diese Ausstrahlungseffekte haben, impliziert, dass die traditionelle Grenze zwischen Naturschutz und Stadtplanung zu einer Theorie der Konvergenz führen könnte. Diese Konvergenz sowie das in das BR Design eingebaute System der Gegenleistungen war Hauptgegenstand der vorliegenden Studie. Damit zielte diese wissenschaftliche Arbeit auf ein ""Verstehen"" der möglichen Trade-Offs dieser Planungstraditionen. Zwei Fallstudien und eine Verbindung von gegenstandsbezogener Theoriebildung und deduktiven Ansätzen wurden für die resultierende Theorie verwendet. Das Design der zwei Fallstudien in Mexiko und Guatemala konzentrierten sich vor allem auf die Überprüfung der Genese der administrativen und staatlichen Einheiten, deren Planungstraditionen und der UNESCO BR Ausweisung (Calakmul BR in Mexiko und Maya BR in Guatemala).

Discovery and biosynthesis of the redox cofactor mycofactocin,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the etiological agent of tuberculosis (TB), can survive as an intracellular pathogen residing in a granulomatous lesion in the lungs. Current TB treatments comprise a long course of several antibiotics with various side effects. Incomplete treatment is leading to antibiotic resistance, a growing threat worldwide. It has been recognized that both antibiotic inactivation and intracellular survival is often mediated by organic cofactors. Furthermore, novel therapeutic compounds in use are prodrugs that require cofactors for in vivo conversion into an active pharmaceutical entity. Mycobacterial cofactors are an up-and-coming field of research for developing novel therapeutic compounds. As such, novel cofactors offer an exciting opportunity to discover novel aspects in the pathogen's physiology and pathology as well as inspiring novel avenues for TB management. Mycofactocin (MFT) is a novel redox cofactor, part of the family of natural products termed ribosomally produced and post-translationally modified peptides and a universal genomic feature of the Mycobacterium genus. Its discovery was spurred from the bioinformatic observation of a gene locus in the vicinity of a radical SAM maturase, containing a small peptide precursor, a chaperone, a peptidase, and a glycosyltransferase, alongside putative MFT-dependent redox enzymes and other genes encoding proteins of unknown function. In-vitro investigation of the biosynthesis pathway showed the formation of the redox-active precursor premycofactocin. In addition, in-vivo studies with the model organism Mycolicibacterium smegmatis have associated MFT to the metabolism of primary alcohols for assimilation as a carbon source. Critical questions remained, such as whether the in vitro biosynthetic model is valid in vivo, the function of the putative glycosyltransferase, the enzymology of MFT-dependent oxidoreductases and dehydrogenases, and the role of MFT in mycobacterial pathogenesis.",gnd:4006902-3

Fast and accurate supertrees : towards large scale phylogenies,"Phylogenetics is the study of evolutionary relationships between biological entities; phylogenetic trees (phylogenies) are a visualization of these evolutionary relationships. Accurate approaches to reconstruct hylogenies from sequence data usually result in NPhard optimization problems, hence local search heuristics have to be applied in practice. These methods are highly accurate and fast enough as long as the input data is not too large. Divide-and-conquer techniques are a promising approach to boost scalability and accuracy of those local search heuristics on very large datasets. A divide-and-conquer method breaks down a large phylogenetic problem into smaller sub-problems that are computationally easier to solve. The sub-problems (overlapping trees) are then combined using a supertree method. Supertree methods merge a set of overlapping phylogenetic trees into a supertree containing all taxa of the input trees. The challenge in supertree reconstruction is the way of dealing with conflicting information in the input trees. Many different algorithms for different objective functions have been suggested to resolve these conflicts. In particular, there are methods that encode the source trees in a matrix and the supertree is constructed applying a local search heuristic to optimize the respective objective function. The most widely used supertree methods use such local search heuristics. However, to really improve the scalability of accurate tree reconstruction by divide-and-conquer approaches, accurate polynomial time methods are needed for the supertree reconstruction step. In this work, we present approaches for accurate polynomial time supertree reconstruction in particular Bad Clade Deletion (BCD), a novel heuristic supertree algorithm with polynomial running time. BCD uses minimum cuts to greedily delete a locally minimal number of columns from a matrix representation to make it compatible. Different from local search heuristics, it guarantees to return the directed perfect phylogeny for the input matrix, corresponding to the parent tree of the input trees if one exists. BCD can take support values of the source trees into account without an increase in complexity. We show how reliable clades can be used to restrict the search space for BCD and how those clades can be collected from the input data using the Greedy Strict Consensus Merger. Finally, we introduce a beam search extension for the BCD algorithm that keeps alive a constant number of partial solutions in each top-down iteration phase. The guaranteed worst-case running time of BCD with beam search extension is still polynomial. We present an exact and a randomized subroutine to generate suboptimal partial solutions. In our thorough evaluation on several simulated and biological datasets against a representative set of supertree methods we found that BCD is more accurate than the most accurate supertree methods when using support values and search space restriction on simulated data. Simultaneously BCD is faster than any other evaluated method. The beam search approach improved the accuracy of BCD on all evaluated datasets at the cost of speed. We found that BCD supertrees can boost maximum likelihood tree reconstruction when used as starting tree. Further, BCD could handle large scale datasets where local search heuristics did not converge in reasonable time. Due to its combination of speed, accuracy, and the ability to reconstruct the parent tree if one exists, BCD is a promising approach to enable outstanding scalability of divide-and-conquer approaches.",gnd:4611085-9 gnd:4076110-1

Potassium (K) deficiency and drought are two major abiotic stresses in agriculture.

From Spitzer mid-infrared observations and measurements of peculiar velocities to constrained simulations of the local universe,"Galaxies are observational probes to study the Large Scale Structure. Their gravitational motions are tracers of the total matter density and therefore of the Large Scale Structure. Besides, studies of structure formation and galaxy evolution rely on numerical cosmological simulations. Still, only one universe observable from a given position, in time and space, is available for comparisons with simulations. The related cosmic variance affects our ability to interpret the results. Simulations constrained by observational data are a perfect remedy to this problem. Achieving such simulations requires the projects Cosmic flows and CLUES. Cosmic flows builds catalogs of accurate distance measurements to map deviations from the expansion. These measures are mainly obtained with the galaxy luminosity-rotation rate correlation. We present the calibration of that relation in the mid-infrared with observational data from Spitzer Space Telescope. Resulting accurate distance estimates will be included in the third catalog of the project. In the meantime, two catalogs up to 30 and 150 Mpc/h have been released. We report improvements and applications of the CLUES' method on these two catalogs. The technique is based on the constrained realization algorithm. The cosmic displacement field is computed with the Zel'dovich approximation. This latter is then reversed to relocate reconstructed three-dimensional constraints to their precursors' positions in the initial field. The size of the second catalog (8000 galaxies within 150 Mpc/h) highlighted the importance of minimizing the observational biases. By carrying out tests on mock catalogs, built from cosmological simulations, a method to minimize observational bias can be derived. Finally, for the first time, cosmological simulations are constrained solely by peculiar velocities. The process is successful as resulting simulations resemble the Local Universe. The major attractors and voids are simulated at positions approaching observational positions by a few megaparsecs, thus reaching the limit imposed by the linear theory.",gnd:7546607-7 gnd:4057375-8 gnd:4337335-5
Lichtinduzierte Redoxchemie von Drosophila melanogaster Cryptochrom und proteingebundenem Ribolumazin,"['Zusammenfassung: Cryptochromes are blue-light dependent flavoproteins, which contribute to various processes including plant growth and regulation of day/night-cycles in many organisms. They were also proposed to be the primary magnetoreceptor in a putative radical pair compass for magnetic orientation of migratory birds.This work presents the first experimental evidence that Drosophila melanogaster cryptochrome, which is known to participate in magnetic sensing, indeed forms a correlated coupled radical pair upon light excitation. Its properties were studied using transient EPR and transient absorption spectroscopy. It was shown that the radical pair meets several conditions required for the proposed role as magnetoreceptor. The interspin distance, for example, was determined to be (2.13 ± 0.03) nm. Thus, in contrast to other members of the protein family, the conserved amino acid residue Trp 342 appears not to be the terminal electron donor. More likely, the neighboring, non-conserved Trp 394 acts as radical pair partner.In a second project, the suitability of protein-bound ribolumazine, the precursor of the ubiquitous riboflavin, for a role as redox-active cofactor was studied. In principle, ribolumazine appears to be capable. Reduction of the fully oxidized molecule proceeds via a radical state, that was thoroughly investigated for the first time. Protonation of N5 yields a neutral radical with a g-Tensor very similar to that of the riboflavin radical. Hyperfine splitting patterns, on the other hand, indicate differences in distribution of the unpaired electron spin throughout the molecule, which could explain different reactivities of ribolumazine and riboflavin', 'Zusammenfassung: Cryptochrome sind blaulichtaktive Flavoproteine und als solche an vielfältigen Prozessen vom Pflanzenwachstum bis hin zur Regulierung der Tag/Nacht-Rhythmik verschiedener Organismen beteiligt.

Modelling continental rift dynamics,"Continental rift systems open up unique possibilities to study the geodynamic system of our planet: geodynamic localization processes are imprinted in the morphology of the rift by governing the time-dependent activity of faults, the topographic evolution of the rift or by controlling whether a rift is symmetric or asymmetric. Since lithospheric necking localizes strain towards the rift centre, deformation structures of previous rift phases are often well preserved and passive margins, the end product of continental rifting, retain key information about the tectonic history from rift inception to continental rupture. Current understanding of continental rift evolution is based on combining observations from active rifts with data collected at rifted margins. Connecting these isolated data sets is often accomplished in a conceptual way and leaves room for subjective interpretation. Geodynamic forward models, however, have the potential to link individual data sets in a quantitative manner, using additional constraints from rock mechanics and rheology, which allows to transcend previous conceptual models of rift evolution. ...",gnd:4619283-9 gnd:4178145-4 gnd:4020212-4 gnd:4313194-3 gnd:4170297-9 gnd:4046317-5 gnd:4451364-1
Binary neutron star merger simulations,"Binary neutron star mergers are associated with a variety of observable phenomena in the gravitational and electromagnetic spectra and are of great importance in a number of different physical subjects, e.g. high energy and gravitational physics. In this thesis, we are investigating binary neutron star systems in the last milliseconds before and after their merger. In such systems gravity is strong and has to be described by Einstein’s full Theory of General Relativity. Because of the complexity of the governing equations of general relativity and relativistic hydrodynamics no analytical solutions exist. Thus, the usage of numerical methods is inevitable. Throughout the thesis we consider different configurations by varying the spin, the equation of state, and the mass-ratio. In particular, we present the first consistent, constraint solved simulations of spinning binary neutron stars in full general relativity and the highest mass ratios simulated to date. Additionally, new numerical methods were implemented in the existing BAM code, most notably a refluxing algorithm which ensures mass conservation across mesh refinement boundaries. This algorithm allowed us to perform the most accurate simulations of the gravitational collapse of a rotating neutron star. In addition to pure numerical waveform modeling, we used high-resolution simulations to validate an improved tidal effective-one-body model and show that the new formalism can predict the waveform accurately up to the moment of merger. Furthermore, the effective-one-body model predicts quasi-universal relations, which we found also in full general relativistic simulations for the inspiral and even in the postmerger phase.",gnd:4171660-7 gnd:4158119-2
The evolution of subsurface urban heat islands under the circumstances of climate change,"['The temperature of the shallow subsurface exhibits recent changes that are caused by climate change at the surface and local anthropogenic heat sources. While the typical rise in temperature can trigger detrimental changes in groundwater quality and stress on dependent ecosystems, elevated ground temperatures also benefit the utilization of shallow geothermal energy. Both, the subsurface temperature rise and the demand for space heating are most pronounced in cities. In associated subsurface urban heat islands the temperature rise caused by urban life and climate change mingles, which makes it hard to differentiate between climate-driven and local anthropogenic effects. This thesis tackles the challenges that arise in such mixed environments by (i) proposing an estimation technique for shallow ground(water) temperatures, (ii) delineating subsurface warming in isolated natural and urban environments, and (iii) assessing the geothermal potential of the excess heat in the shallow ground.', 'groundwater temperature, climate change, shallow geothermal energy, geothermal potential, urban hydrology, urban heat island, water resources, remote sensing', 'Die Temperatur des oberflächennahen Untergrunds verändert sich global durch den Klimawandel und lokal durch anthropogene Stressoren.

Algorithms and applications for low power wireless sensor networks using wake-up receivers,"Abstract: Energy is the driving problem of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Usually, sensor nodes operate for a long period of time and the only source of power supply is battery cells. The diﬃculty of accessing and exchanging the batteries leads to a desire for maintenance-free sensor nodes. The functionality of WSNs can be extended through the use of low power microprocessors, sensors and radio transceivers. The availability of low power hardware components provides a technological break-through for wake-up receivers. These receivers interact only when a special wake-up signal addresses them. When a wake-up signal is received, the wake-up receiver triggers the sensor node to activate its radio transceiver. Each sensor node has the capability of transmitting a wake-up signal to a near-by sensor node. Data communication occurs only when the node switches on its transceiver. During this time, the rest of the nodes remain in a sleep state to sustain their energy supply. Here, the nodes avoid overhearing the exchange of data packets which are not intended to them. On the contrary, the duty cycle process of waking up periodically to check the medium for messages or synchronizing with other sensor nodes is not necessary. This raises the hope that duty-cycling might soon be replaced by the wake-up receivers. Nevertheless, the wake-up receivers have to resolve several challenges to be able to participate eﬃciently in sensor networks. The high energy demand of wake-up signals and the short wake-up coverage ranges compared to data communication diminish the capabilities of sensor nodes. Therefore, in this work new wake-up algorithms are developed to address the shortcoming in the technology to overcome the challenges imposed on the networks through empowering the nodes with the ability to identify eﬃcient ways to manage their energy resources. Still, these shortcomings have a direct eﬀect on the ability of the network to maintain its connectivity. In general, the nodes can construct a wake-up network and a data communication network depending on the nodes coverage ranges. A node failure in the wake-up network might disconnect the node from delivering the data to their neighbors in the data network because of the inability of the nodes to wake them up. Hybrid algorithms that combine duty-cycle and wake-up receivers will solve this problem through maintaining active backbones to allow the sensor network to remain connected. Moreover, wake-up receivers have an ...",gnd:4789222-5 gnd:4123135-1

Semi-empirical sea-level modelling,"Semi-empirical sea-level models (SEMs) exploit physically motivated empirical relationships between global sea level and certain drivers, in the following global mean temperature. This model class evolved as a supplement to process-based models (Rahmstorf (2007)) which were unable to fully represent all relevant processes. They thus failed to capture past sea-level change (Rahmstorf et al. (2012)) and were thought likely to underestimate future sea-level rise. Semi-empirical models were found to be a fast and useful tool for exploring the uncertainties in future sea-level rise, consistently giving significantly higher projections than process-based models. In the following different aspects of semi-empirical sea-level modelling have been studied. Models were first validated using various data sets of global sea level and temperature. SEMs were then used on the glacier contribution to sea level, and to infer past global temperature from sea-level data via inverse modelling.

Optical frequency comb generation in optical fibres,"Optical frequency combs (OFC) constitute an array of phase-correlated equidistant spectral lines with nearly equal intensities over a broad spectral range. The adaptations of combs generated in mode-locked lasers proved to be highly efficient for the calibration of high-resolution (resolving power > 50000) astronomical spectrographs. The observation of different galaxy structures or the studies of the Milky Way are done using instruments in the low- and medium resolution range. To such instruments belong, for instance, the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) being developed for the Very Large Telescope (VLT) of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) and the 4-metre Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope (4MOST) being in development for the ESO VISTA 4.1 m Telescope. The existing adaptations of OFC from mode-locked lasers are not resolvable by these instruments. Within this work, a fibre-based approach for generation of OFC specifically in the low- and medium resolution range is studied numerically. This approach consists of three optical fibres that are fed by two equally intense continuous-wave (CW) lasers. The first fibre is a conventional single-mode fibre, the second one is a suitably pumped amplifying Erbium-doped fibre with anomalous dispersion, and the third one is a low-dispersion highly nonlinear optical fibre. The evolution of a frequency comb in this system is governed by the following processes: as the two initial CW-laser waves with different frequencies propagate through the first fibre, they generate an initial comb via a cascade of four-wave mixing processes. The frequency components of the comb are phase-correlated with the original laser lines and have a frequency spacing that is equal to the initial laser frequency separation (LFS), i.e. the difference in the laser frequencies. In the time domain, a train of pre-compressed pulses with widths of a few pico-seconds arises out of the initial bichromatic deeply-modulated cosine-wave. These pulses undergo strong compression in the subsequent amplifying Erbium-doped fibre: sub-100 fs pulses with broad OFC spectra are formed. In the following low-dispersion highly nonlinear fibre, the OFC experience a further broadening and the intensity of the comb lines are fairly equalised. This approach was mathematically modelled by means of a Generalised Nonlinear Schrödinger Equation (GNLS) that contains terms describing the nonlinear optical Kerr effect, the delayed Raman response, the pulse self-steepening, and the linear optical losses as well as the wavelength-dependent Erbium gain profile for the second fibre. The initial condition equation being a deeply-modulated cosine-wave mimics the radiation of the two initial CW lasers. The numerical studies are performed with the help of Matlab scripts that were specifically developed for the integration of the GNLS and the initial condition according to the proposed approach for the OFC generation. The scripts are based on the Fourth-Order Runge-Kutta in the Interaction Picture Method (RK4IP) in combination with the local error method. This work includes the studies and results on the length optimisation of the first and the second fibre depending on different values of the group-velocity dispersion of the first fibre. Such length optimisation studies are necessary because the OFC have the biggest possible broadband and exhibit a low level of noise exactly at the optimum lengths. Further, the optical pulse build-up in the first and the second fibre was studied by means of the numerical technique called Soliton Radiation Beat Analysis (SRBA). It was shown that a common soliton crystal state is formed in the first fibre for low laser input powers. The soliton crystal continuously dissolves into separated optical solitons as the input power increases. The pulse formation in the second fibre is critically dependent on the features of the pulses formed in the first fibre. I showed that, for low input powers, an adiabatic soliton compression delivering low-noise OFC occurs in the second fibre. At high input powers, the pulses in the first fibre have more complicated structures which leads to the pulse break-up in the second fibre with a subsequent degradation of the OFC noise performance. The pulse intensity noise studies that were performed within the framework of this thesis allow making statements about the noise performance of an OFC. They showed that the intensity noise of the whole system decreases with the increasing value of LFS.",gnd:7633313-9 gnd:4143252-6 gnd:4167589-7
High-resolution direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy of the human kinetochore chromatin,"The kinetochore is a chromatin-protein complex on the chromosome centromere. Kinetochore attache chromosomes to the microtubules of the spindle apparatus, recognize attachment to microtubules, and regulate the progress of mitosis. The kinetochore protein complex is built on the periphery centromere chromatin. It seems that kinetochores react to forces of the spindle apparatus microtubules in their interior. Due to the limited resolving power of the optical microscope and limitations of electron microscopy, the spatial arrangement of kinetochore protein and chromatin complex is unresolved. In this thesis, the human periphery centromere chromatin assembled with CENP-A (kinetochore chromatin in further text), on which kinetochore complex is built, was imaged by high-resolution optical microscopy called direct Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (dSTORM). Resolving power of less than 30 nm was achieved, and the architecture of more than 900 kinetochores in different sub-stages of interphase and mitosis was resolved. Kinetochore chromatin was formed in a rectangle between 250 and 400 nm long and between 150 and 270 nm wide. It was composed of parallel and orthogonal lines between 12 and 75 nm wide. The arrangement of kinetochore chromatin in mitosis was narrower and longer than in interphase. In interphase, subtle changes in the dimensions of kinetochore lines were measured. The mitotic toxin nocodazole disturbed kinetochore chromatin organization. The discovered change of arrangement of the kinetochore chromatin assembled with CENP-A during the cell cycle could be the physical mechanism of recognition of proper attachment and positioning of the chromosomes at the equatorial plate. Based on the discovered kinetochore structure and behavior in the cell cycle, a new shoo-lace model of assembly and function of kinetochore chromatin is suggested.",gnd:4039238-7 gnd:4010152-6 gnd:4283659-1 gnd:4190668-8

Energy transfer and dissipation in plasma turbulence : from compressible MHD to collisionless plasma,"['This book revisits the long-standing puzzle of cross-scale energy transfer and dissipation in plasma turbulence and introduces new perspectives based on both magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) and Vlasov models. The classical energy cascade scenario is key in explaining the heating of corona and solar wind. By employing a high-resolution hybrid (compact finite difference & WENO) scheme, the book studies the features of compressible MHD cascade in detail, for example, in order to approximate a real plasma cascade as “Kolmogorov-like” and to understand features that go beyond the usual simplified theories based on incompressible models. When approaching kinetic scales where plasma effects must be considered, it uses an elementary analysis of the Vlasov–Maxwell equations to help identify the channels through which energy transfer must be dissipated. In addition, it shows that the pressure–strain interaction is of great significance in producing internal energy. This analysis, in contrast to many other recent studies, does not make assumptions about wave-modes, instability or other specific mechanisms responsible for the dynamics – the results are direct consequences of the Vlasov–Maxwell system of equations.

Energy scaling by stacking of ultrashort pulses in a passive enhancement cavity,"New applications of ultrafast laser systems require parameters, which are out of reach for classical single amplifier channels. Coherent pulse combining can help to circumvent the limitations, which state-of-the-art laser systems are facing. For that purpose, passive optical resonators, so-called enhancement cavities, can be used to stack laser pulses, thus, drastically increasing their pulse energy. Extracting such an enhanced pulse from the cavity, could lead to a set of laser parameters, not accessible to other amplifier technologies. Enhancement cavities running at 80 MHz or above have been used as pulse stacking devices before, employing acousto-optic-modulators (AOM) as switches to extract the stacked energy. However, the nonlinear phases, as introduced by self-phase-modulation in the AOM, commonly limit the achievable intra-cavity energy of a so-called stack-and-dump cavity. By lengthen such cavities to 10 MHz, the extractable energies from such a device were improved by three orders of magnitude from 200 nJ to 160 µJ compared to former experiments. While longer cavities could allow for even higher energies, they are difficult to set-up and are often limited by their complexity and stability related issues. This is why, novel switches would have to be introduced, if the potential of stack-and-dump cavities is to be exhausted. A rotating element in the cavity is identified as one possible solution. It circumvents acceleration-related limitations and could allow for fast extraction of the enhanced pulse without disturbing the enhancement process. Possible switches based on rotation include a chopper wheel with mirror-segments attached to its side-facet and a ‘rotating-cavity-caustic’. Both have been investigated and identified to be viable solutions.",gnd:4014692-3 gnd:4160446-5 gnd:4708559-9 gnd:4222149-3 gnd:4318035-8 gnd:4417888-8 gnd:4172691-1 gnd:4205012-1 gnd:4034610-9

"Algorithm selection, scheduling and configuration of Boolean constraint solvers","Boolean constraint solving technology has made tremendous progress over the last decade, leading to industrial-strength solvers, for example, in the areas of answer set programming (ASP), the constraint satisfaction problem (CSP), propositional satisfiability (SAT) and satisfiability of quantified Boolean formulas (QBF). However, in all these areas, there exist multiple solving strategies that work well on different applications; no strategy dominates all other strategies. Therefore, no individual solver shows robust state-of-the-art performance in all kinds of applications. Additionally, the question arises how to choose a well-performing solving strategy for a given application; this is a challenging question even for solver and domain experts.

From unstructured to structured : context-based named entity mining from text,"With recent advances in the area of information extraction, automatically extracting structured information from a vast amount of unstructured textual data becomes an important task, which is infeasible for humans to capture all information manually. Named entities (e.g., persons, organizations, and locations), which are crucial components in texts, are usually the subjects of structured information from textual documents. Therefore, the task of named entity mining receives much attention. It consists of three major subtasks, which are named entity recognition, named entity linking, and relation extraction. These three tasks build up an entire pipeline of a named entity mining system, where each of them has its challenges and can be employed for further applications. As a fundamental task in the natural language processing domain, studies on named entity recognition have a long history, and many existing approaches produce reliable results.

Identification of novel regulatory mechanisms involved in plant-herbivore interactions in Nicotiana attenuata,"The jasmonate signaling is one of the most studied hormone signaling pathways in plants that mediate important physiological processes. When plants are attacked by herbivores, they induce the biosynthesis of huge pools of jasmonic acid (JA) and the biologically active (+)-7-iso-jasmonoyl-L-isoleucine (JA-Ile). JA-Ile is perceived by the receptor complex (SCFCOI1) and facilitates degradation of the repressors of the jasmonate signaling and activation of MYC2 transcription factors (TFs). MYC TFs, then, orchestrate downstream jasmonate responses. Few hours after the initial attack, the levels of JA and JA-Ile wanes to the basal level; however, no mechanism has been identified so far that attenuates defense responses by hydrolysis of JA-Ile. Due of the cost of defense responses, plants regulate the duration and amount of responses. Here, we report two novel regulatory mechanisms that regulate herbivore-induced plant defense responses in N. attenuata. The first regulatory mechanism involves a hydrolase we identified (Jasmonoyl-L-isoleucine hydrolase 1, JIH1) in N. attenuata. JIH1 hydrolyses JA-Ile and attenuates the JA-Ile burst in planta; in a manner that mirrors the in vitro hydrolytic activity of heterologously expressed JIH. When JIH1 was silenced by inverted-repeat silencing, the transformed plants (irJIH1 plants) accumulated significantly more JA-Ile and direct/indirect defenses. The performances of a specialist (Manduca sexta) and generalist (Spodoptera littoralis) herbivores were significantly lower on irJIH1 plants compared to wild type plants. Our data signify the importance of this regulatory mechanism in plant defense regulation.",gnd:4049075-0 gnd:4626532-6 gnd:4141194-8 gnd:4159584-1

Model-driven engineering of self-adaptive software,"The development of self-adaptive software requires the engineering of an adaptation engine that controls the underlying adaptable software by a feedback loop. State-of-the-art approaches prescribe the feedback loop in terms of numbers, how the activities (e.g., monitor, analyze, plan, and execute (MAPE)) and the knowledge are structured to a feedback loop, and the type of knowledge. Moreover, the feedback loop is usually hidden in the implementation or framework and therefore not visible in the architectural design. Additionally, an adaptation engine often employs runtime models that either represent the adaptable software or capture strategic knowledge such as reconfiguration strategies. State-of-the-art approaches do not systematically address the interplay of such runtime models, which would otherwise allow developers to freely design the entire feedback loop.

About sisters and starlets : Bsister and MIKC*-type MADS-box genes in rice development,"I investigate the function and evolution of different rice MIKC-type MADS-box genes, which due to their high variety and significance in plant development are excellent objects to study the outcome of gene duplications. Bsister MADS-box genes are known for their predominant role in plant female organ development. The rice Bsister gene OsMADS29 confers the ‘canonical’ Bsister function in rice. With a detailed comparative meta-analysis of all available Bsister gene expression patterns I underline the significance of OsMADS29-like genes within grass ovule and seed development. These genes are all very strongly and more or less exclusively expressed during ovule and/or seed development thus resembling eudicot and gymnosperm Bsister gene expression patterns. I further performed a detailed analysis of the rice gene OsMADS30 showing that it is a non-canonical Bsister gene: it has a comparatively weak and broad expression and T-DNA-insertion lines show no aberrant seed phenotype. I further demonstrated that OsMADS30 evolved under relaxed purifying selection and has a 3’ region that strongly deviates from other grass Bsister genes, including closely related OsMADS30 orthologs from wild rice species. This is due to the recent insertion of a hitherto unknown transposable element. T-DNA insertion lines of OsMADS30 show diminished vegetative growth, which might be first evidence for a neo-functionalization of OsMADS30. I also studied MIKC*-type MADS-domain proteins that function in pollen development: OsMADS62, OsMADS63 and OsMADS68. I demonstrate that they bind not as homodimers but only as heterodimers to DNA. This thesis contributes to a deeper understanding of the developmental and evolutionary significance of various rice MADS-box genes. Eventually it shows how fundamentally different the results of gene duplications even within the same gene family can turn out.",gnd:4049271-0 gnd:4365090-9

Advancing the understanding for hydro-climatic controls on water balance and lake-level variability in the Tibetan Plateau : Hydrological modeling in data-scarce lake basins integrating multi-source data,"The contrasting patterns of lake-level changes across the Tibetan Plateau (TP) are indicators of differences in the water balance over the TP. However, little is known about the key hydrological factors controlling this variability. The purpose of this study was to contribute to a more quantitative understanding of these factors for four selected lakes in the southern-central part of the TP: Nam Co and Tangra Yumco (increasing water levels), and Mapam Yumco and Paiku Co (stable or slightly decreasing water levels). Therefore, an integrated approach combining hydrological modeling, atmospheric-model output and remote-sensing data was developed. The J2000g hydrological model was adapted and extended according to the specific characteristics of closed-lake basins on the TP and driven with High Asia Refined analysis (HAR) data at 10 km resolution for the period 2001–2010. Differences in the mean annual water balances among the four basins are primarily related to higher precipitation totals and attributed runoff generation in the Nam Co and Tangra Yumco basins. Precipitation and associated runoff are the main driving forces for inter-annual lake variations. The glacier-meltwater contribution to the total basin runoff volume (between 14 and 30% averaged over the 10-year period) plays a less important role compared to runoff generation from rainfall and snowmelt in non-glacierized land areas. These results highlight the benefits of linking hydrological modeling with atmospheric-model output and satellite-derived data in regions where observation data are scarce, and the developed approach can be readily transferred to other data-scarce closed-lake basins, opening new directions of research.",gnd:4064734-1 gnd:4016796-3

"Mechanisms of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction by sulforaphane and combinatorial effects of sulforaphane and 3,3'-Diindolylmethane on cancer cell growth inhibition","The chemopreventive isothiocyanate sulforaphane, which is derived from broccoli, was shown to induce a mitotic cell cycle arrest in the human colon cancer cell line 40-16. This arrest was followed by mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. Sulforaphane potently inhibited NF- B activation upstream of its nuclear translocation and decreased the expression of a series of anti-apoptotic, NF- B-dependent genes, which supposedly facilitated apoptosis induction. Transient exposure of 40-16 cells to sulforaphane for up to 6 h resulted in reversible G2/M cell cycle arrest and cytostatic growth inhibition, whereas a minimum continuous exposure time of 12 h was necessary for sulforaphane to irreversibly arrest cells in G2/M and subsequently induce apoptosis. Low concentrations of sulforaphane caused a transient decrease in cytoplasmic glutathione levels followed by glutathione induction after 24 h. However, depletion of glutathione did not seem to play a role for sulforaphane-induced apoptosis. Combination effects of sulforaphane and 3,3'-diindolylmethane were investigated in terms of cell growth inhibition in the 40-16 cell line. Sulforaphane and 3,3'-diindolylmethane inhibited cell proliferation antagonistically at low concentrations, but synergistically at cytotoxic concentrations.",gnd:4161565-7 gnd:4069853-1 gnd:4162573-0

Tunable hyperchromatic lenses,"Zusammenfassung: Optical full-field imaging, as microscopy, delivers three-dimensional information of the topology of surfaces. To extend the information from the sample under test, hyperspectral imaging additionally delivers the spectral answer of the sample. This additional feature can be conceived as a means for food control or as a diagnostic approach in dermatology.This thesis presents the design, fabrication, and characterization of a tunable hyperchromatic lens for confocal hyperspectral imaging systems. The hyperchromatic lens has a compact structure consisting of a diffractive lens, a tunable refractive membrane lens, and a pinhole in front of a detector for spectral filtering by spatially separating the wavelengths of a focused beam. The method makes use of an extended longitudinal chromatic aberration. Thereby, the refractive lens is continuously hydraulically tuned by an integrated magnetic actuator, allowing a fast scan over the entire spectrum of the incident light.Three different prototypes of the hyperchromatic lens system have been realized: (i) a hybrid hyperchromatic lens with separated diffractive and refractive lens, (ii) a system with diffractive structures imprinted onto the lens membrane, and (iii) a hyperchromatic micro-lens array.The spectral resolution, achieved with the realized hyperchromatic systems, is in the order of 15nm for both types of single lenses. Due to smaller lens diameters in case of the arrays, the spectral resolution is somewhat reduced. The systems have been designed for a broad spectral range, and the functionality could successfully be verified for wavelengths between 450 and 900 nm",gnd:4167776-6 gnd:4315379-3

Modulation of posttranscriptional and posttranslational regulatory processes by histone deacetylase inhibitors,"Acetylation is a very critical posttranslational modification in vivo. Targeting lysine residues of various proteins crucially modulates protein functions and interactions. The inhibitors of histone deacetylases are promising anticancer drugs  currently in clinical testing. We could show that the treatment of cells with these histone deacetylase inhibitors is able to modulate cell fate by enhancing conditions that trigger apoptosis by two distinct mechanisms. Firstly, VPA and co-treatment with the chemotherapeutic agent HU induce expression of the pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein BIM. The enhanced BIM expression arises from an increase in transcription of the BIM gene in an AP1-dependent manner. This effect occurs in cultured cells and in primary head and neck cancer cells from patients. We observed that the effect of apoptosis induction following treatment is mainly dependent on the level of BIM protein.",gnd:4027007-5 gnd:4128704-6 gnd:7564795-3 gnd:4059798-2

High precision x-ray spectroscopy of highly charged heavy ions,"In the present thesis, the advantages of two new and complementary detector concepts for x-ray spectroscopy of highly charged ions over conventional semiconductor detectors have been worked out. These two detectors are the twin crystal spectrometer FOCAL and the metallic magnetic microcalorimeter maXs. Although the maXs microcalorimeter is still under development, first very promising x-ray spectra could be recorded at the ESR storage ring at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt. With the crystal spectrometer FOCAL, which was fully equipped for the first time, a dedicated beam time at the ESR, aiming for the precise determination of the 1s Lamb shift of hydrogen-like gold (Au78+), could be conducted. The obtained result for the Lyman-a1 transition energy is afflicted with a small statistical uncertainty, however, the encountered systematic effects are still posing a challenge to overcome. In the outlook, it will be discussed in detail how the accuracy of a future measurement could be improved, and in which way both detector concepts could support each other optimally.",gnd:4047982-1 gnd:4166502-8 gnd:4180494-6 gnd:4050331-8 gnd:4287503-1 gnd:4190373-0 gnd:4249018-2 gnd:4189262-8

Copper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition as synthetic tool for triazole-based ligands,"Within in the last five years, chemists have identified a wide range of additional applications for the 1H-1,2,3-triazole heterocycle, e.g., synthesizing bidentate 2-pyridyl-substituted 1H-1,2,3-triazole (trzpy) ligands. The system itself is known since 1970 and has been obtained by recyclization of v-triazolo[l,5-a]pyridines. In 1977, Seebach et al. combined non-enolizable nitriles and lithiated nitrosamines providing N1-substituted trzpys. The regioselective copper(I)-catalyzed 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of 2-ethynylpyridines with organic azides exclusively yields 1,4-substituted trzpys, a very versatile scaffold offering plenty of beneficial properties. This thesis compiles construction, metal coordination chemistry and macromolecular chemistry of trzpy ligands. The regioselective copper(I)-catalyzed 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition between organic azides and terminal alkynes (CuAAC) represented the key step for the preparation of the trzpy-based chelators. The use of the triazole entity provided a facile access to bidentate chelates that can be regarded as analogs to 2,2´-bipyridines. Using the CuAAC as a synthetic tool enabled a convenient functionalization of the trzpy ligands: Reactive functional groups can be directly introduced by designing the organic azide and allow subsequent chemical transformations, such as the application of radical polymerization methods. Furthermore, the CuAAC is able to support the introduction of additional functional moieties at the triazole (providing solubility, introducing substituents) due to its high tolerance to a wide range of reaction conditions and to a large independence on the electronic configuration of the deployed reactants.",gnd:4186045-7 gnd:4223142-5 gnd:4266702-1 gnd:4148483-6

"Vibrationally resolved absorption, emission, resonance Raman and photoelectron spectra of selected organic molecules, associated radicals and cations : a time-dependent approach","Time-dependent correlation function based methods to study optical spectroscopy involving electronic transitions can be traced back to the work of Heller and coworkers. This intuitive methodology can be expected to be computationally efficient and is applied in the current work to study the vibronic absorption, emission, and resonance Raman spectra of selected organic molecules. Besides, the ""non-standard"" application of this approach to photoionization processes is also explored. The application section consists of four chapters as described below. In Chapter 4, the molar absorptivities and vibronic absorption/emission spectra of perylene and several of its N-substituted derivatives are investigated. By systematically varying the number and position of N atoms, it is shown that the presence of nitrogen heteroatoms has a negligible effect on the molecular structure and geometric distortions upon electronic transitions, while spectral properties are more sensitive: In particular the number of N atoms is important while their position is less decisive. Thus, N-substitution can be used to fine-tune the optical properties of perylene-based molecules. ...",gnd:7576892-6 gnd:4176916-8 gnd:4133471-1 gnd:4054010-8 gnd:4174491-3 gnd:4076475-8 gnd:4195863-9
Laser Wakefield Electron Acceleration : A Novel Approach Employing Supersonic Microjets and Few-Cycle Laser Pulses,"This thesis covers the few-cycle laser-driven acceleration of electrons in a laser-generated plasma. This process, known as laser wakefield acceleration (LWFA), relies on strongly driven plasma waves for the generation of accelerating gradients in the vicinity of several 100 GV/m, a value four orders of magnitude larger than that attainable by conventional accelerators. This thesis demonstrates that laser pulses with an ultrashort duration of 8 fs and a peak power of 6 TW allow the production of electron energies up to 50 MeV via LWFA. The special properties of laser accelerated electron pulses, namely the ultrashort pulse duration, the high brilliance, and the high charge density, open up new possibilities in many applications of these electron beams.",gnd:4139081-7 gnd:4151894-9 gnd:4184611-4

Design strategy for imaging systems containing freeform surfaces,"Motivations driven by the ever-growing system specifications, alongside the progress in optical manufacturing and metrology open widely the door for implementing freeform surfaces for imaging system performance enhancement. Meanwhile, new challenges regarding handling and analysis are posed for this surface type due to its lack of rotational symmetry. This thesis work focuses on the development of an appropriate aberration analysis tool, as well as implementation strategies of freeform surfaces in imaging systems. The Aldis theorem, which gives the surface contribution for one ray including all orders, is revisited as the foundation for freeform system analysis. With the original theorem’s limitations overcome, this new tool can serve as an alternative for the Seidel diagram, indicating the system sensitivity information for freeform systems. Furthermore, this thesis investigates the numerical approaches utilized for freeform implementation regarding freeform normalization radius, freeform order, optimization strategy, freeform interaction and early-stage manufacturability assessment for both one-freeform and two-freeform issues. As a consequence, the relation between the choice of the freeform location and system aberration constitutions is revealed with the assistance of the surface eccentricity parameter. A successive implementation strategy for freeform orders and freeform quantity is proposed in the form of a workflow. Diverse system examples are presented in the end as further validation of the findings.",gnd:4338132-7 gnd:4148259-1 gnd:4198736-6 gnd:4132894-2 gnd:4126186-0

Strukturinnovationen im Journalismus : die Auswirkung unternehmensstrategischer Entscheidungsprämissen auf das journalistische Handeln,"['The structural changes in journalism must be tied to the adaptation of roles, and programmes and organisations attached to the strategic decisions of media organisations. Newsrooms have proven themselves to be ‘more efficient’ and ‘more adaptable’, but working methods have proved to be ‘more exhausting’. In ‘permanent editorial conferences’, there is excessive communication and coordination; the operational production process has become more important. A print editorial office in the classical sense does not exist any more. These structural changes have economised journalistic action and limited journalists’ options for action. Examples of this are cooperation in matters of syndication and continuous optimisation processes. This empirical study shows that the constraints of the economic system are increasing in current journalistic practice.

High-dimensional function approximation : breaking the curse with Monte Carlo methods,"In this dissertation we study the information-based complexity for high-dimensional function approximation problems. In the deterministic setting for many unweighted problems the curse of dimensionality holds, that means, for some fixed error tolerance the complexity grows exponentially with the dimension. For integration problems one can usually break the curse with the standard Monte Carlo method. For function approximation problems, however, similar effects of randomization have been unknown so far. The thesis contains results on three more or less stand-alone topics. Chapter 2 is concerned with lower bounds for the Monte Carlo error for general linear problems via Bernstein numbers. This technique is applied to the uniform approximation of certain classes of smooth functions, where it turns out that randomization does not affect the tractability classification of the problem. Chapter 3 studies the uniform approximation of functions from Hilbert spaces with methods that may use arbitrary linear functionals as information. For certain unweighted periodic tensor product spaces, in particular Korobov spaces, we observe the curse of dimensionality in the deterministic setting, whereas with randomized methods we achieve polynomial tractability. Chapter 4 deals with the approximation of monotone functions via function values. It is known that this problem suffers from the curse of dimensionality in the deterministic setting. A new upper bound shows that Monte Carlo methods do break the curse. Almost matching lower bounds are found as well, from which follows that randomization will not help significantly for small error tolerances.",gnd:4176929-6 gnd:4120913-8

It also uncovers the complex and multifaceted ways in which the geographical and cultural proximity to Western Europe can be creatively used as a powerful resource in the pursuit of building systems of innovation in the East. Moreover, the book demonstrates that it is possible for East European systems of innovation to develop highly creative domestic dynamics without necessarily imitating Western systems or styles of innovation. Providing a unique empirical analysis of how systems of innovation undergo far-reaching transformation and change, this book will be of interest to economists and scholars involved in issues relating to innovation, technology, economic development and East-West integration.

Development of a numerical approach for the simulation of boatlanding maneuvers,"['The thesis is about the development of a numerical method for the simulation of boat-landing maneuver at offshore platforms. The approach is based on a boundary panel method, and it computes the boat-landing maneuver in the time domain considering the non-linear free water surface. A fender contact model is applied to describe the friction forces between fender and boat-landing struts and to detect whether the fender slips or not during the landing maneuver. Furthermore, model tests are conducted in waves. The experimental data is used to validate the developed method. It is demonstrated that the approach is able to simulate the boat-landing maneuver and that it is able to forecast the occurrence of slip during the maneuver.', 'Die Arbeit handelt von der Entwicklung einer numerischen Methode zur Simulation von Anlegemanövern von Serviceschiffen an Offshore-Plattformen.

They can remain viable for a long time and hence might accumulate in sediments during burial. Because of methodological problems, the number of endospores in sediments has only rarely been quantified. In the present work, a cultivation-independent method was developed to determine the number of endospores. This method is based on the fluorimetric determination of dipicolinic acid (DPA), a spore specific compound. Sediment cores taken from the German Wadden Sea were analyzed for their DPA depth profile. Determined DPA contents corresponded to 1×10 5 to 2×10 7 endospores g -1 sediment. The endospore depth profiles were irregular, but reflected the vertical changes in lithology. The highest endospore numbers were found in thin black mud layers. At sediment surface endospores represented less than 1% of the total cell counts.

The crucial role of mindsets in innovation efforts : opening the black box in the context of frugal innovation,"['Innovation research has investigated the relevance of innovations for organizational competitiveness and the role of innovations for social as well as economic welfare. Accordingly, scholars and practitioners frequently emphasize the innovation processes that lead to desired innovative outcomes. Nevertheless, these innovation processes have to be carried out by motivated individuals. Increasingly, academic literature takes the mindsets of these actors into consideration. However, diverging conceptualizations limit our understanding of the term ""mindset"" and the role of individuals’ mindsets in organizational innovation efforts. This book aims at opening the “black box” of innovation as a mindset. Linking mindset theories from social psychology to the context of frugal innovation, the author provides rigorous conceptual work on mindsets in innovation. This conceptual research is supported by findings from two empirical studies. This book makes important contributions to theory and practice: to academic research by developing conceptual clarity on understanding innovation as a mindset and providing supportive empirical evidence, and to innovation practice by showing how a detailed understanding of individuals’ mindsets can inform evidence-based change interventions.

Oberflächenmodifikation von Titandioxid mittels Kupfer-Plasma-Immersions-Ionen-Implantation und Charakterisierung der physikochemischen und mikrobiologischen Eigenschaften,"['A special setup to treat titanium samples with plasma immersion ion implantation was designed, constructed and established. Here, in difference to conventional PIII setups, a capacitive coupled RF discharge with two coplanar electrodes directly above the samples was used. By the use of copper as electrode and sample holder material and by choosing special process parameters it was possible to oxidize the titanium and simultaneously dope the titanium samples with copper. In addition to gas flow controllers also liquid flow controllers were installed. This allows the use of gases, vaporized liquids and eroded solids in different combinations for the PIII process simultaneously. The voltage and the length of the PIII pulses were variable. The current through the titanium sample was measured to get a direct value for the implanted amount of ions. The temperature of the treated samples was measured in-situ with a pyrometer. The relevant electrical parameters were measured by using an oscilloscope. It reveals that an overall ion current of up to 48 mA could be implanted. This is equivalent to 3.5 x 1015 ions cm-2 s-1 and an energy flux of 5 J cm-2 s-1. The resulting temperatures of the substrate surface are up to 600ʿC. These obtained parameters are equal to conventional PIII setups.

Random environments and the percolation model : non-dissipative fluctuations of random walk process on finite size clusters,"Percolation process, which is intrinsically a phase transition process near the critical point, is ubiquitous in nature. Many of its applications embrace a wide spectrum of natural phenomena ranging from the forest fires, spread of contagious diseases, social behaviour dynamics to mathematical finance, formation of bedrocks and biological systems. The topology generated by the percolation process near the critical point is a random (stochastic) fractal. It is fundamental to the percolation theory that near the critical point, a unique infinite fractal structure, namely the infinite cluster, would emerge. As de Gennes suggested, the properties of the infinite cluster could be deduced by studying the dynamical behaviour of the random walk process taking place on it.

Development and properties of all-dielectric and metal-dielectric heterostructures at atomic scale,"Heterostructures have increasingly attracted attention in recent times to enable various optoelectronic and photonic applications. In this Dissertation, atomic scale heterostructures of two technologically relevant oxides, such as, Al2O3 and TiO2 were developed by plasma enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) technology. Their growth, composition, dispersion relation, and optical bandgap were systematically studied by means of various state of the art characterization methods. The dispersion spectra and the indirect optical bandgap of the heterostructures depend on the ratio of the two oxides, while the bandgap is very sensitive to the thicknesses of the barrier and quantum well layers. A significant blue shift of the absorption edge has been obtained by decreasing the TiO2 (quantum well) thickness down to about 0.5 nm. This study unfolds the possibility of achieving quantizing effects using dielectric heterostructures enabled by the control of layer thickness and properties down to an atomic scale. Furthermore, a unique combination of metal-dielectric heterostructure using Ir and Al2O3 are introduced. Their structural-property relationships were determined by various spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. Precisely tuning the ratio of the constituents provided by the ALD technology ensures the tailoring of the dispersion spectra along with a transition from effective dielectric to metallic heterostructures. Following this, the development of epsilon-near-zero metamaterials with tunable dielectric constants was explored by precisely varying the composition ratio of such heterostructures. The impact of such heterostructures in nonlinear optical processes, such as, second harmonic generation has also been examined. Altogether, this Dissertation enables a path towards atomic scale processing of tailored heterostructures demonstrating an extension of the material basis available for novel optical functionalities.",gnd:7712127-2 gnd:4123378-5

In turn, the thesis explores the nucleation of carbon clusters on the surface from C monomers prior to graphene formation. Small arch-shaped clusters containing four to six C atoms, which may be key in graphene formation, are predicted to be long-lived on the surface.

Depth-sensing indentation of soft matter,"The advantages and current limitations of depth-sensing indentation (DSI) as a characterization tool for polymer materials are discussed throughout this thesis. It could be demonstrated that depth-sensing indentation studies of soft polymers are still a challenging field which is up to now only in its infancy. Within the summarized studies a base for the reliable characterization of polymer libraries was created. This included a careful verification of suitable indentation parameters as well as a cross-evaluation of the obtained results with complementary techniques, which ultimately allowed not only to determine the underlying intermolecular changes of the sample system, but also verified the level of precision which can currently be obtained by DSI. Particular problems arise for soft sample systems due to the material behavior that does not comply with the typical characteristics of hard materials for which DSI was originally designed. In Chapter 2 practical solutions for the investigation of soft polymers are provided. In particular the adjustment of the unloading cycle turned out to be sufficient to improve the data integrity significantly. The determined measurement protocol was applied in Chapter 3 to a polymer library consisting of poly(2-oxazoline)s with different molecular architecture. Different aspects which influence the mechanical properties could be determined: The crystallinity, branching and the influence of adsorbed water molecules. It was demonstrated in Chapter 4 that DSI can also be used to investigate time-dependent processes, like UV-induced crosslinking. A polystyrene / polybutadiene copolymer system with varying amounts of crosslinking agent was used to investigate this process by a stepwise irradiation/measurement cycle. The presented studies clearly show that DSI on soft sample systems inherently suffers from non-ideal sample behavior. A standardized application of DSI will certainly rely on an implementation of refined models to extract the mechanical properties.",gnd:4685614-6 gnd:4703729-5 gnd:4038852-9 gnd:4046699-1
Degenerate U- and V-statistics under weak dependence : asymptotic theory and bootstrap consistency,"Numerous test statistics can be approximated by statistics of U- or V-type. In the case of i.i.d. random variables the limit distribution can be derived by a spectral decomposition of the kernel if the latter is square integrable. To use the same method for dependent data, restrictive assumptions on the associated eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are required. In the majority of cases, it is quite complicated or even impossible to check these conditions. Therefore we employ a wavelet decomposition of the kernel in order to derive the asymptotic distributions of U- and V-statistics for weakly dependent data. This approach only requires some moment constraints and smoothness assumptions concerning the kernel. The asymptotic distributions of U- and V-statistics for both independent and weakly dependent observations cannot be used directly since they depend on certain parameters, which in turn depend on the underlying situation in a complicated way. Therefore, problems arise as soon as critical values for test statistics of U- and V-type have to be determined. The bootstrap offers a convenient way to circumvent these problems, see [3] for the i.i.d. case. We derive the consistency of general bootstrap methods for statistics of weakly dependent data.",gnd:4129514-6 gnd:4754777-7 gnd:4508692-8

Design of sustainable cathodes for Li-ion batteries : understanding the redox behaviour of guaiacyl and catecholic groups in lithium organic system,"In recent years people have realised non-renewability of our modern society which relays on spending huge amounts of energy mostly produced from fosil fuels, such as oil and coal, and the shift towards more sustainable energy sources has started. However, sustainable sources of energy, such as wind-, solar- and hydro-energy, produce primarily electrical energy and can not just be poured in canister like many fosil fuels, creating necessity for rechragable batteries. However, modern Li-ion batteries are made from toxic heavy metals and sustainable alternatives are needed.

"Water management policies and their impact on irrigated crop production in the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia","The economic impact analysis contained in this book shows how irrigation farming is particularly susceptible when applying certain water management policies in the Australian Murray-Darling Basin, one of the world largest river basins and Australia’s most fertile region. By comparing different pricing and non-pricing water management policies with the help of the Water Integrated Market Model, it is found that the impact of water demand reducing policies is most severe on crops that need to be intensively irrigated and are at the same time less water productive. A combination of increasingly frequent and severe droughts and the application of policies that decrease agricultural water demand, in the same region, will create a situation in which the highly water dependent crops rice and cotton cannot be cultivated at all.",gnd:4840171-7 gnd:4145124-7 gnd:4124439-4

Analysis of Quantised Vortex Tangle,"[""In this thesis, the author develops numerical techniques for tracking and characterising the convoluted nodal lines in three-dimensional space, analysing their geometry on the small scale, as well as their global fractality and topological complexity---including knotting---on the large scale. The work is highly visual, and illustrated with many beautiful diagrams revealing this unanticipated aspect of the physics of waves. Linear superpositions of waves create interference patterns, which means in some places they strengthen one another, while in others they completely cancel each other out. This latter phenomenon occurs on 'vortex lines' in three dimensions. In general wave superpositions modelling e.g. chaotic cavity modes, these vortex lines form dense tangles that have never been visualised on the large scale before, and cannot be analysed mathematically by any known techniques. ."", 'Introduction -- Numerical Methods -- Geometry and Scaling of Vortex Lines -- Topological Methods -- Knotting and Linking of Vortex Lines -- Conclusions. .']",gnd:4176603-9 gnd:4159128-8 gnd:4060425-1 gnd:4065310-9 gnd:4020236-7 gnd:4338132-7 gnd:4316104-2 gnd:4148259-1 gnd:4128386-7
Scaling laws and emergent effects for plasticity in heterogeneous materials,"Abstract: We revisit models that describe the propagation of dislocations through random heterogeneous media. We derive a fully nonlinear model describing the evolution of a dislocation in the line tension approximation in a homogeneous medium with random obstacles. We investigate the pinning (the dislocation becomes stuck) and depinning behavior (the dislocation line swipes over a strictly positive mean area per time unit) of this model for dislocation glide. We show that our model obeys Taylor Scaling, i.e., the critical pinning force scales like the square root of the concentration of obstacles. As the energy dissipation of dislocations is not purely viscous, we need to extend the theory of viscosity solutions to treat partial differential inclusions arising while modeling dry friction kinetics. The analysis of the pinning behavior is based on explicit construction of sub- and supersolutions and hence the existence of a comparison principle is fundamental for our study. Finally, we explore numerical methods for a relaxed model of dislocation slip",gnd:4463279-4 gnd:4344548-2 gnd:4201275-2
The UNESCO MAB Programme in South Africa : current challenges and future options relating to the implementation of biosphere reserves,"['Biosphärenreservat, Südafrika, UNESCO, MAB, biosphere reserves, spatial prioritization, conservation planning', 'The UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Programme has been active in South Africa for almost 20 years. The country currently has six designated biosphere reserves with a few sites in various stages of the nomination process. Within the South African context, agencies are using a series of seemingly different instruments to practice landscape-scale management. The UNESCO biosphere reserve concept sometimes finds it difficult to obtain prominence amongst these different landscape initiatives. Biosphere reserves are special sites wherein sustainable development is promoted. For this reason, the biosphere reserve concept has much to offer towards long-term sustainable socialecological land management. In our modern age of population growth, dwindling natural resources and a general disconnectedness of humans from nature due to large scale urbanization, there is an urgent need for innovative ways in which to showcase sustainable living practices. South Africa has limited natural, economic and social resources and therefore needs to prioritize where these resources could best be allocated. This dissertation comprises the history of the MAB Programme in South Africa, as well as a multicase study on five existing biosphere reserves.

Global Change and Land Use Effects on Carbon Turnover in Tidal Wetlands,"Tidal wetlands, such as tidal marshes and mangroves, are global hotspots for carbon sequestration. The preservation of organic matter is a critical process by which tidal wetlands exert their strong influence over the global carbon cycle and at the same time gain elevation to keep pace with sea level rise. This thesis addresses the effects of numerous global change factors (sea level rise, warming, land use change, biological invasions) on organic matter turnover processes in tidal wetlands, aiming to assess their role in the carbon sequestration potential of these ecosystems. Besides studying direct effects of different factors on decomposition and turnover processes, this work is particularly focused on plant mediated and thus indirect effects. The thesis is structured in 7 chapters, including a general introduction to the topic (Chapter 1), five manuscripts as the main part (Chapters 2-6), and a synthesis discussing the links between the single chapters, their implications, and resulting future research perspectives (Chapter 7).",gnd:4206569-0 gnd:4064847-3 gnd:4217650-5 gnd:4164552-2

A multi-wavelength study of the evolution and pc-scale jet kinematics of active galaxies,"Active galaxies have been in the forefront of astronomic research since their first discovery, at least 50 years ago . The putative supermassive black hole (SMBH) at their center characterizes their properties and regulates the evolution of these objects. I investigate the evolution of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the context of a merger-driven evolution scheme. Under this assumption, galaxy mergers trigger activity in galaxies, both in the form of intense star-formation, as well as nuclear activity. This investigation uses the Caltech-Jodrell Bank flat-spectrum (CJF) sample, a statistically complete sample of compact, radio-loud AGN. I find evidence supporting the merger-driven evolution scheme of AGN, exhibiting the relevance of merger events in active galaxies. In particular, almost 30% of the CJF sources in the local Universe (z<0.4) show evidence of recent past, present, or possible future mergers. This is important in light of the unbiased selection effects of the CJF sample. In addition, I find a broken correlation between the near-infrared luminosity of the CJF sources and their total radio luminosity at 5 GHz. Low luminosity sources show an excess of near-infrared emission, compared to their high luminosity counterparts. A correlation between near-infrared colors and multiwavelength variability is also found. Finally, I trace the different stages of AGN evolution by selecting individual sources that fit the respective selection criteria, finding 14 promising candidates for binary black hole (BBH) systems in the CJF ...",gnd:4057375-8 gnd:4048200-5

Interactive Surface Environments : Design and Implementation,"This dissertation presents three studies on the design and implementation of interactive surface environments. It puts forward approaches to engineering interactive surface prototypes using prevailing methodologies and technologies. The scholarly findings from each study have been condensed into academic manuscripts, which are conferred herewith.  The first study identifies a communication gap between engineers of interactive surface systems (i.e., originators of concepts) and future developers. To bridge the gap, it explores a UML-based framework to establish a formal syntax for modeling hardware, middleware, and software of interactive surface prototypes. The proposed framework targets models-as-end-products, towards enabling a shared view of research prototypes thereby facilitating dialogue between concept originators and future developers.  The second study positions itself to support developers with an open-source solution for exploiting 3D point clouds for interactive tabletop applications using CPU architectures. Given dense 3D point-cloud representations of tabletop environments, the study aims toward mitigating high computational effort by segmenting candidate interaction regions as a preprocessing step. The study contributes a robust open-source solution for reducing computational costs when leveraging 3D point clouds for interactive tabletop applications. The solution itself is flexible and adaptable to variable interactive surface applications.  The third study contributes an archetypal concept for integrating mobile devices as active components in augmented tabletop surfaces. With emphasis on transparent development trails, the study demonstrates the utility of the open-source tool developed in the second study. In addition to leveraging 3D point clouds for real-time interaction, the research considers recent advances in computer vision and wireless communication to realize a modern, interactive tabletop application. A robust strategy that combines spatial augmented reality, point-cloud-based depth perception, CNN-based object detection, and Bluetooth communication is put forward. In addition to seamless communication between adhoc mobile devices and interactive tabletop systems, the archetypal concept demonstrates the benefits of preprocessing point clouds by segmenting candidate interaction regions, as suggested in the second study.  Collectively, the studies presented in this dissertation contribute; 1—bridging the gap between originators of interactive surface concepts and future developers, 2— promoting the exploration of 3D point clouds for interactive surface applications using CPU-based architectures, and 3—leveraging 3D point clouds together with emerging CNN-based object detection, and Bluetooth communication technologies to advance existing surface interaction concepts.",gnd:4131424-4 gnd:7689895-7 gnd:4125909-9
Evolution of reservoir properties in the Lower Triassic aquifer sandstones of the Thuringian Syncline in Central Germany,"The Buntsandstein (Lower Triassic) aquifer sandstones of the Thuringian Syncline are important for water supply, geothermal energy and storage wells. The aim of this study was to analyse the control factors of the diagenetic and petrophysical properties of the Buntsandstein, and particularly the influence of varying depositional parameters, thermal history, subsidence and exhumation. The Thuringian Buntsandstein records fluvial, sandflat, lacustrine and eolian environments. The dominant reason for porosity loss in the sandstones is mechanical compaction. The permeabilities depend on their predominant depositional facies: fine grained lacustrine sandstones in the Lower Buntsandstein have low permeabilities (about 4 mD); conversely, Middle Buntsandstein sandflat, fluvial and eolian sandstones are moderately to highly permeable (27 – 108 mD). Thermal maturity data of Carboniferous, Permian and Triassic sediments provide information about the maximum burial depth of the Buntsandstein rocks. Between 1800 m and 3800 m of overburden must have been eroded from the Thuringian Syncline. The thickness of the Zechstein to Lower Jurassic succession is insufficient to explain the level of thermal maturity. A substantial cover of strata younger than Lower Jurassic must have been present over most of the Thuringian Syncline. The erosion of this cover must have occurred near the end of the Cretaceous period during a widespread inversion event. The pore space and the mineral surfaces exposed to the pore space of the four main facies types were studied using digital image analysis on thin sections and BET measurements. The abundance of large pores influences the permeability of a rock, as well as pore density and porosity. As a result of different types of mineral surfaces exposed to the pore space, the sandstones of the four facies types will exhibit distinctly different reactions upon contact with fluids.",gnd:4009081-4 gnd:4353455-7 gnd:4173962-0

Stochastic partial differential equations with fractal noise : two different approaches,"This thesis deals with stochastic partial differential equations driven by fractional noises. In this work, problems related to this topics are tackled and solved from two fairly different points of view. On one side we prove existence, uniqueness and regularity for mild solutions to a parabolic transport diffusion type equation that involves a non-smooth coefficient. We investigate related Cauchy problems on bounded smooth domains with Dirichlet boundary conditions by means of semigroup theory and fixed point arguments. Main ingredients are the definition of a product of a function and a (not too irregular) distribution as well as a corresponding norm estimate. As an application, transport stochastic partial differential equations driven by fractional Brownian noises are considered in the pathwise sense. On the other side we deal with stochastic differential equations driven by fractal noises in Banach spaces. More precisely, we deal with abstract Cauchy problems driven by fractional Brownian processes in Banach spaces and look for weak and mild solutions. To this aim, a fractional Brownian motion in separable Banach spaces is introduced by means of cylindrical processes. The related stochastic integral is then defined as cylindrical stochastic process and its properties are investigated. When the Banach space is a function space then the equation becomes a stochastic partial differential equation driven by a fractional noise.",gnd:4135969-0 gnd:4147404-1
Reproducible and automated analysis of metabolomics data to assess the biosynthetic capacities of organisms in microbial communities,"The thesis entitled ""Reproducible and automated analysis of metabolomics data to assess the biosynthetic capacities of organisms in microbial communities"", investigates the role of marine microbial communities in maintaining ecological balance through the exchange of metabolites. High-throughput omics techniques have transformed microbial research, where metabolomics is crucial to elucidate and analyzes these metabolites that are involved in the metabolic exchange and hence, affect our ecosystem. We developed Metabolome Annotation Workflow (MAW), a workflow for untargeted tandem mass spectrometry data. The workflow takes the tandem mass spectrometry data as input and annotates chemical structures to the metabolites detected in the input spectra. FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles have been implemented to the workflow to enable reproducibility and portability of the workflow across different workflow platforms and operating systems. This workflow was then applied to a marine microalgae, the diatom Skeletonema marinoi to expand the chemical space produced by this diatom. Furthermore, we developed another module of MAW, that detected statistically significant metabolites among co-culture condition of two microorgansism (S. marinoi and a marine haptophyte Prymnesium parvum), to explores chemical interactions between the two organisms to uncover insights into microbial communication.",gnd:4453251-9 gnd:4533764-0 gnd:4290091-8 gnd:1138059420

The HILITE setup for high-intensity-laser experiments with highly charged ions : design and commissioning,"Quantitative studies of the interaction of atomic and molecular ions with laser radiation at high laser intensities and / or high photon energies are a novel area in the field of laser-matter-interaction. They are facilitated by precise knowledge of the properties of the ions as a target for the laser. This refers to the location, composition, density and shape of the ion cloud as a target, as well as to the capability of characterising the ion target before and after the laser interaction. Ion traps are versatile instruments when it comes to localising ions with a defined particle composition, density and state within a specific and small volume in space. They allow in particular the combination of ions in well-defined quantum states with intense photon fields. The present thesis contains the detailed description of the setup and commissioning of the HILITE Penning trap, which is dedicated to providing a well-defined cloud of highly charged ions for a number of different experiments with intense lasers. In the present thesis, the experimental setup is described in detail and the components required for ion target preparation, characterisation and non-destructive ion detection inside the trap are characterised. Special attention is paid to the counting limits of the detection electronics, because knowledge of the exact number of stored ions is essential for the planned experiments. Highly charged ions are produced in an electron-beam ion trap (EBIT), decelerated, dynamically captured and stored. For the preparation of a well-defined ion cloud, the initially high energetic ions must be slowed and cooled to an energy of less than 1 meV. This thesis describes the applied methods of active-feedback cooling and resistive cooling and examines their potential cooling efficiencies.",gnd:4034610-9 gnd:4226687-7 gnd:4153930-8 gnd:4245919-9 gnd:4246725-1

New bio-based polymers : synthesis and polymerization of cystine-based macrocycles,"Redox-responsive polymers, such as poly(disulfide)s, are a versatile class of polymers with potential applications including gene- and drug-carrier systems. Their degradability under reductive conditions allows for a controlled response to the different redox states that are present throughout the body. Poly(disulfide)s are typically synthesized by step growth polymerizations. Step growth polymerizations, however, may suffer from low conversions and therefore low molar masses, limiting potential applications. The purpose of this thesis was therefore to find and investigate new synthetic routes towards the synthesis of amino acid-based poly(disulfide)s. The different routes in this thesis include entropy-driven ring opening polymerizations of novel macrocyclic monomers, derived from cystine derivatives. These monomers were obtained with overall yields of up to 77% and were analyzed by mass spectrometry as well as by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy.

Surround View pedestrian detection,"In this thesis, novel methods that enable and support Surround View pedestrian detection are developed. As a part of the so called Surround View System, the introduced detection and localization approaches can be used to prevent and mitigate accidents involving pedestrians. We begin by giving a complete description of the processing chain required to find pedestrians in the input images obtained from four wide-angle cameras. Then, a novel heterogeneous cascaded classifier approach is introduced, which combines the computational efficiency of early simple stages with the classification performance of powerful final stages. In order to further increase the performance of our heterogeneous cascade, a feature-based inter-stage information transfer algorithm is introduced. To deal with occlusions caused by the mounting positions of the cameras, a classification scheme is introduced to also handle only partially visible pedestrians. To complement the intensity-image based classification approach, we propose to use a multi-stage rejection chain employing dense optical flow. It is shown that by analyzing dense flow images and egomotion information of the current scene, the likelihood that an image window contains a pedestrian can be inferred. The approach incorporates the uncertainties of all inputs which is important when dealing with the noisy data received from the flow- and egomotion-estimation. Due to the way that detected pedestrians are displayed in the Surround View System, the detection location in the image must be very precise. It is shown how localization can be treated as a subsequent step to pedestrian detection that aims at finding the exact position of pedestrians in an input image. Then, two different novel approaches for pedestrian localization using neural networks with local receptive fields are introduced and evaluated.",gnd:4056783-7 gnd:4140907-3 gnd:4264283-8
Numerical simulation of ice accretion on coated wind turbine blades,"['This thesis aims to develop new OpenFOAM codes to simulate the ice accretion on wind turbine blades in cold climates and the effects of ice-phobic coatings on the overall anti-icing heat. To avoid high computational costs of resolving complex profiles of ice, rough wall functions are used to model the effects of roughness on the airflow without completely resolving the flow field. Water particles carried by air are then tracked using Lagrangian particle tracking to calculate the exact locations of impingement on the surface to determine whether the particles are pinned or bouncing on the surface. The water mass on the surface is determined and the thermodynamic model of icing is solved to determine the ice profile. A 3D rotating wind turbine blade is simulated using the quasi-3D technique and compared with other CFD codes for validation and the expected minimum anti-icing heat in case ordinary surfaces is compared to the ice-phobic case to study the feasibility of such coatings.', 'Ziel dieser Doktorarbeit ist die Entwicklung neuer Codes innerhalb OpenFOAM zur Simulation der Eisbildung, das auf dem Rotorblatt im kalten Klima bildet und den Energiebedarf für das Anti-Eis-System zu berechnen.

Distribution and habitat use of selected small and large mammal species in relation to different land use,"Landscapes have been changing due to human activity, resulting in forest fragmentation and spreading agricultural use. Nowadays land use strategies in Central Europe are changing. However, it is yet not fully understood if and to what extend these changes in management intensity will affect the communities in according habitats. In the present study I used small and large mammals as target species, because they play a major role in forest and grassland ecosystems acting as food resource for predators, seed dispersers, as well as browsers or grazers. Small mammals were live trapped over two years in all three Exploratories. Faecal pellet group counts of large ungulates were applied in the Exploratory Schorfheide-Chorin. During small mammal live trapping I found higher species richness and animal abundance on managed than on unmanaged forest plots rising with increased structural heterogeneity. Hence, understory vegetation and coarse woody debris are very important for small mammal species in managed forest stands. Faecal pellet group counts revealed that roe deer and fallow deer clearly preferred mature pine stands.

City growth in Europe,"One of the most notable features of literature about ""new economic geography"" is a close association between theoretical and empirical work. In contrast to earlier research, theoretical studies are often much more strongly focused on real-world phenomena. At the same time, empirical work is often more closely tied to theoretical models. Instead of purely detecting possible stylized facts, considerable efforts have been made to test for the relevance of theoretical results. A major shortcoming of recent empirical work in urban economics is, however, the startling concentration on basically only two estimation strategies. Probably driven by limited data availability, most analyses are either cross-country studies which usually seek to explore a data set as rich as possible, or the studies examine single country data and then often focus on U.S. experiences. This book aims to provide a new - European - perspective. The basic idea is that a focus on European cities, apart from being interesting for itself, allows to combine both previous approaches. In particular, there is considerable cross-country variation while, in addition, also reliable historical data is available. Therefore, it is one of the contributions to compile a new data set of European cities which covers 13 countries and ranges from 1870 to 1990. This set of data is then applied to explore several hypotheses which have been recently proposed in literature. In particular, three sets of issues are discussed: the growth pattern of cities and their implications for Zipf's law, the relationship between trade openness and urban concentration, and the role of history for city growth. The results are often striking. In contrast to some previous findings, for instance, there is only weak evidence for random growth across cities. Also, the empirical evidence for an association between external trade and internal geography turns out to be shaky. Finally, it is argued that the urban dominance of Vienna after the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1918 is evidence in favor of path dependence in city growth. Taken together, the book shows that the European experience provides a rich laboratory of real-world data which still waits to be explored",gnd:4182752-1 gnd:4064115-6 gnd:4056730-8 gnd:4056723-0 gnd:4121889-9
Kinetic studies in GeO2/Ge system : a retrospective from 2021,"""This title investigates reaction kinetics in GeO2/Ge systems, aiming to demonstrate the fundamentals of the GeO2/Ge interface and to give insight into the distinctive features and performance of Ge (germanium) applied to advanced complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) devices.

Complex reasoning with answer set programming,"Answer Set Programming (ASP) allows us to address knowledge-intensive search and optimization problems in a declarative way due to its integrated modeling, grounding, and solving workflow. A problem is modeled using a rule based language and then grounded and solved. Solving results in a set of stable models that correspond to solutions of the modeled problem. In this thesis, we present the design and implementation of the clingo system---perhaps, the most widely used ASP system. It features a rich modeling language originating from the field of knowledge representation and reasoning, efficient grounding algorithms based on database evaluation techniques, and high performance solving algorithms based on Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solving technology. The contributions of this thesis lie in the design of the modeling language, the design and implementation of the grounding algorithms, and the design and implementation of an Application Programmable Interface (API) facilitating the use of ASP in real world applications and the implementation of complex forms of reasoning beyond the traditional ASP workflow.",gnd:121613023X
An integrated “omics” approach to unravel the impact of root symbionts on tomato direct and indirect defenses against insect herbivores,"As sessile organisms, plants are constantly under attack by insect herbivores. To defend themselves, they have developed a broad array of direct and indirect defense mechanisms. Plants can also build mutualistic relationships with several microbes that are hosted in their rhizosphere. These microbes provide their hosts with essential services, such as improved mineral uptake, nitrogen fixation, growth promotion, and protection from pathogens and insect herbivores. Among these beneficial microbes, the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF) Rhizophagus irregularis and the plant growth-promoting fungus (PGPF) Trichoderma harzianum have been broadly studied. In the present doctoral study, tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) was used as a model plant to investigate the effect of R. irregularis and T. harzianum on modulating tomato’s direct and indirect defenses against insect herbivores. Overall, the study aims to explore the potential of using beneficial root fungi in protecting crop plants against insect herbivores. In this frame, a series of experiments, comprising transcriptomic and metabolomic approaches, was conducted aiming to illuminate aspects of plant-microbe-insect interactions that are less studied and contribute to the transformation of conventional to sustainable Agriculture. Conclusively, the results presented in this doctoral thesis indicate that the beneficial root fungi R. irregularis and T. harzianum mediate plant-insect interactions and can trigger important effects over the three trophic levels: namely the plant, its herbivores, and their natural enemies. Therefore, these findings reinforce the potential of beneficial root fungi to be used in Agriculture as a promising alternative tool to reduce the use of chemical insecticides, ensure crop productivity and food security, and protect human health as well as the environment.",gnd:4775956-2 gnd:4133841-8 gnd:4045539-7 gnd:4170911-1 gnd:4416206-6 gnd:4659394-9 gnd:4195374-5

Genetic and Biological Characterization of Atypical Porcine Pestivirus (APPV) Associated with Congenital Tremor in Newborn Piglets,"Pestiviruses are enveloped RNA viruses belonging to the family Flaviviridae which comprises significant animal and human pathogens. A novel genetically distinct pestivirus, designated Atypical porcine pestivirus (APPV), was recently discovered and subsequently demonstrated to be a major cause of congenital tremor (CT) in newborn piglets. Within the present project, investigations of apparently healthy pigs from different parts of Europe and Asia (n=1,460) revealed remarkably high APPV genome (8.9%) and antibody (60%) detection rates, which together with reports from North and South America, indicate the global distribution and high abundance of APPV. Characterization of APPV variants from different origins demonstrated the high genetic variability of APPV. High genome (19%) and antibody (52%) detection rates of APPV in wild boar were demonstrated, which indicates that wild boar may serve as a wild animal reservoir for APPV. Furthermore, humoral immune response induced after a field infection with APPV was characterized. Findings indicate that E2 glycoprotein represents the immune-dominant antigen for induction of neutralizing antibodies against APPV infections. Maternally derived antibodies (MDA) could be detected at a low titer and rapidly declined. Presence of MDA in new born piglets apparently did not confer protection against APPV infections. A subclinical horizontal infection was observed when healthy and infected piglets were mingled on the flat deck. Results provide strong evidence that protective immunity against APPV infection can be achieved after horizontal infection. In contrast to the classical pestiviruses, typical persistent infection was not observed for APPV infection. Findings of this project help to understand the epidemiology and pathogenesis of this novel pathogen and are useful for the implementation of tailored prevention strategies.",gnd:4739291-5 gnd:4113937-9 gnd:4012494-0 gnd:4053848-5 gnd:4185979-0 gnd:4002290-0

Residual restoration of DNA lesions in Deinococcus radiodurans mutants indicate presence of a bypass UV-repair process,"[""The differing UV-susceptibility and UV-damage repair capability of the Deinococcus radiodurans strains and the hypothesis of a bypass repair system have been investigated. The results obtained provide evidence that UV radiation engenders synergistic effects in combination with other stressors like temperature, humidity, desiccation and vacuum. A post-0.5 h-recovery phase was sufficient for wild-type strain to repair up to 80% of the total induced DNA photoproducts. Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is given priority over homologeous recombination repair (HR), based on the fact that 1R1A (recA) resumed repair of bipyrimidine dimers but UVs78 (uvrA-1 uvsE) did not repair any photoproduct type. Not only genetic equipment but also the applied wavelengths influence D. radiodurans' repair efficiency, especially polychromatic UV radiation enables the UV-sensitive class to repair the UV-induced lesions and retain their vitality. Hence, a further pathway must be present that can repair both photoproduct classes. The proposed core genes of the novel bypass system are DR2438, DR2439, DR2441 and DR2444 as well as DR2445, DR2446. Whereas the assertion that DR1200 and DR1891 may act as putative signal factors to initiate the NER- and HR-independent bypass still has to be verified. <engl.>"", ""Die durchgeführten Studien belegen, daß UV-Strahlung als synergistischer Umweltfaktor fungiert.

Chemical and electrochemical behavior of sulfur and sulfides in electrochemical cells,"This cumulative dissertation is about different possibilities to use sulfur as part of electrochemical storage devices and is based on four independent publications. One is dealing with the mobility and identity of elemental sulfur in a porous carbon matrix. The property changes of sulfur which is staying in physical contact with carbon were monitored by different analytical methods and are discussed. The relevance of the findings regarding metal/sulfur-batteries was experimentally verified. The second topic was about the (electro)-chemical stability of the Li3PS4 solid electrolyte against lithium electrodes and InLi-alloy electrodes of different stoichiometry. The article discusses the relationship between electrode potential, electrode phase composition, and electrode/electrolyte-interface stability. Further, it provides a guideline for using InLi electrodes correctly in combination with thiophosphate solid electrolytes. The last project describes the realization of a Na/polysulfide-cell with two liquid electrolyte chambers separated by a solid electrolyte. Poor cyclability characteristics were counteracted with two approaches: The use of P2S5 as additive and tetramethylurea as solvent. Moreover, Vis-spectroscopy was applied and the tetramethylurea electrolyte has been characterized. A review article presenting the different concepts of sulfur utilization in electrochemical cells is also included. Therein, advantages, disadvantages, and challenges of the concepts are discussed.

Beyond that, it addresses electron-beam lifetimes in third-generation synchrotron light sources, in particular with a view to optimizing them in the forthcoming ESRF upgrade. The lifetime of the electron beam in a storage ring is a measure of how fast electrons are being lost, and is thus an essential parameter determining the required injection frequency, which in turn affects beam stability and power consumption. The main limitation on the beam lifetime in these synchrotron light sources is the Touschek effect, i.e. the single scattering between two electrons in a bunch. In this thesis a model able to predict the Touschek lifetime is presented. The model is successfully tested against measurements and used to study the influence of other parameters such as current and size of vacuum chamber.
